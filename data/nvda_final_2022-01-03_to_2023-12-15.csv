2022-01-03 00:00:00+00:00,3 Surefire Metaverse Stocks That Could Make You Richer in 2022,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-surefire-metaverse-stocks-that-could-make-you-richer-in-2022,"The metaverse has created quite a buzz as companies and investors scramble to stake a claim in this digital gold rush. Yet this conceptual reality remains largely in the ether, not yet grounded in reality. So what exactly is the metaverse?
In simplest terms, the metaverse combines a number of emerging technologies -- including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) -- with elements of ubiquitous tech like social media and video, resulting in an immersive digital world where users can work, play, shop, and socialize. Bulls are calling the metaverse the next evolution of the internet, providing a network of always-on virtual spaces where people can interact.
Naturally, investors are looking for a way to profit from this quickly evolving landscape of what many think will be ""the next big thing."" Let's look at three successful companies that will benefit from the vast opportunities in the coming metaverse.

Nvidia: Powering the metaverse
No discussion regarding the metaverse would be complete without the processing power necessary to bring the idea to life, and that's where Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) comes in. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the undisputed industry standard for generating lifelike images in video games, giving it a leg up in the metaverse.
The humble GPU has a superpower that will make it a foundational technology in the digital realm. Parallel processing allows GPUs to process a multitude of complex mathematical calculations simultaneously and at lightning-fast speeds.
This capability ushered in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), making Nvidia GPUs the workhorse in every major cloud computing operation and in a growing number of data centers. The evolution of the metaverse will require similar speed and precision, making Nvidia's state-of-the-art semiconductors the obvious beneficiary.
Yet even if the metaverse takes years to materialize, Nvidia continues to grow like wildfire. During the first nine months of this year, Nvidia's revenue climbed 65% year over year, driving its earnings per share up 132%. Nvidia generated revenue of roughly $16.7 billion last year, but that's a drop in the ocean compared to its total addressable market, which management estimates will top $250 billion by 2023.
The incredible potential offered by the metaverse is merely icing on the cake for long-term shareholders.

Unity Software: Creating the metaverse before our eyes
While it may not be a household name, Unity Software (NYSE: U) is well-known among the gaming and developer communities. The company provides a set of software tools that helps developers create, run, and monetize interactive, real-time 2D and 3D content for mobile phones, tablets, PCs, and consoles, as well as AR and VR devices. These tools will create the real-time graphics underlying the metaverse.
Unity recently advanced these goals with the acquisition of certain assets of visual effects specialist Weta Digital, the brainchild of filmmaker Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies). Weta Digital helped create the visuals for iconic content including Avatar, The Avengers, Game of Thrones, Planet of the Apes, Suicide Squad, Black Widow, and more. By adding Weta's tools to its creative offerings, Unity is hastening the coming of the metaverse.
But Unity Software doesn't need the metaverse to be a success, as evidenced by its third-quarter results. The company generated revenue of $286 million, up 43% year over year. At the same time, Unity delivered a loss of share of $0.41, cutting its red ink by more than half. Not only did the company beat expectations, but it raised its full-year outlook. Unity is now expecting revenue of about $1.08 billion, up roughly 40% at the midpoint of its guidance.
Annual metrics help complete the picture. Games created on Unity's platform represented 71% of the top 1,000 mobile games in the fourth quarter of last year. Unity closed out 2020 with monthly active users of 2.7 billion, up 63% year over year. At the same time, applications built with Unity were downloaded 5 billion times per month, up 41%.
Whether the metaverse takes a year or a decade to spring to life, Unity Software will prosper either way.

Matterport: Mapping physical spaces to create digital replicas
Matterport (NASDAQ: MTTR) is another company without name recognition, but it will be critical to this new era of the Internet. The spatial data company uses 3D cameras to capture and digitize real-world spaces, then creates dimensionally accurate and photorealistic virtual replicas. This process provides customers with the insight to manage spaces more effectively. But that's just the beginning.
Matterport recently announced strategic partnerships with cloud titan Amazon and Meta Platforms' Facebook AI Research (FAIR). Additionally, the company released Matterport for Mobile, putting its 3D capture tools in the hands of anyone with a Google Android phone by Alphabet or an Apple iPhone.
Its specialized offerings mean Matterport is currently serving a niche market, but one that has the potential to grow exponentially. For the first nine months of this year, the company generated total revenue of $84 million, up 35% year over year. Subscription and license revenue grew even faster, up 54% to roughly $49 million.
It's important to note that Matterport has only been a public company since July, so it's still very much in its early stages. Thus, its operating expenses outpaced revenue so far this year and it continues to burn cash. This should abate over time as the company leverages its digital software aspirations.
Matterport uses a freemium model to attract paying customers. For the first nine months of this year, its total subscriber count of 439,000 more than doubled, growing 116%, massively expanding its potential customer pool. At the same time, paid subscribers climbed 35%. Additionally, its net dollar expansion rate was 114%, meaning the existing customers spent 14% more than in the prior-year period.
Management estimates Matterport's total addressable market at $240 billion -- and that's before any potential contribution from the metaverse. The company has also positioned itself for the coming digital realm and its tools will likely play a key role in mapping out the new digital world.
There's real opportunity in the virtual realm
The metaverse has yet to make its way from the drawing board to reality, but many of the necessary components are already in place -- and the opportunity is significant. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak estimates the metaverse will be worth roughly $8 trillion, so there's plenty of potential profits to go around.
The metaverse could propel each of these companies -- already successful in their own right -- to new heights, and help make investors richer in 2022, and for decades to come.

2022-01-05 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Intel Popped, but AMD and Nvidia Dropped Today",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-popped-but-amd-and-nvidia-dropped-today,"What happened
It's Jan. 5 and at long last, the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2022) is underway in Las Vegas.
In contrast to last year's fully virtual event, this year's CES is going the hybrid route, with some exhibitors coming in person while others appearing only virtually. One thing that is definitely not virtual -- but real -- is the effect that the CES presentations seem to be having on tech stock prices, and semiconductor stocks in particular.
As chipmakers demo their wares today, shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) (a ""featured exhibitor"" at CES 2022) are enjoying a nice 2.4% pop in afternoon trading, as of 2:22 p.m. ET. In contrast, Intel rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are moving in the opposite direction -- down 4.3% and 4.6%, respectively.

So what
So did Intel buy itself a pass on the chipmaker stock price declines, along with its ""featured exhibitor"" status at CES?
Not exactly. But investors do seem to be taking a shine to Intel's products unveiled at the show, and seem to be thinking that they position Intel's stock (if not necessarily Intel's business) to outperform its rivals in the coming year. As IGN Entertainment reported yesterday, ""Intel is planning to take on AMD and Nvidia in the GPU market this year, with its first generation of Arc series GPUs codenamed Alchemist slated to release sometime early this year.""
Granted, AMD and Nvidia are also focusing heavily on graphics this year (graphics being the historical roots of each of these companies). Yesterday, for example, data analytics company Lynx highlighted the more than two dozen new chips that AMD will bring to market in 2022, with emphasis on the Radeon RX 6000S and RX 6000M chips for gaming laptops. And IGN seemed particularly impressed by the prospect of Nvidia bringing to market a new ""RTX 3090 Ti"" chip with ""24GB of GDDR6X VRAM and 40 teraflops of GPU performance.""
Translating the tech-speak into English, IGN helpfully explained that this chip, when it comes to market, will be ""roughly 11% faster than its non-Ti RTX 3090 variant.""
Now what
At least one analyst still thinks the advantage lies with Intel, however. In a note out this morning, Northland Capital Markets said it is upgrading Intel stock to outperform based on its view that Intel has laid out for investors a coherent strategy to reverse its decline ""for the first time in many years,"" reports StreetInsider.com.
Beyond just Intel's efforts to compete with AMD and Nvidia in graphics, Northland believes that Intel is upping its game in basic chip technology, to the point that it could ""significantly reduce the AMD/INTC performance gap if not eliminate it in 2023."" Northland sees Intel collaborating with Taiwan Semiconductor on production of next generation 3 nm and even 2 nm semiconductors, and refocusing its internal efforts on ""manufacturing [static random access memory chips] which dominate modern CPU die area.""
More significant for investors, Northland simply thinks that Intel stock at less than 10 times earnings is a better bargain than ""high multiple stocks"" such as AMD (which costs 43 times earnings today) and Nvidia (which costs 93 times earnings). In contrast to its pricier rivals, which may suffer from ""multiple compression"" this year (i.e., investors may not want to pay high multiples of earnings to own the stocks, resulting in falling stock prices), low-priced Intel stock could rise as much as 14% in value over the course of the next year.
Investors who watched their Intel shares underperform the market all year long in 2021 can only hope that Northland is right about that, and that Intel will finally reverse its slump in 2022.

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) surged over 14%, and waves of euphoria overpowered fears of slowing growth and a prolonged pandemic. Wednesday brought a very different tune, as the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) suffered its worst single-day drop in months and turned negative for the year after the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated interest rates could rise faster than expected.
Here's the latest on Tesla, electric vehicles (EVs), and the pros and cons that could impact the industry next.
Image source: Getty Images.
A heavyweight in the U.S. stock market
Daniel Foelber: With a market cap of $1.2 trillion as of Monday's close, Tesla stock can really move both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. In fact, the S&P 500 has a market cap of roughly $40.4 trillion and the Nasdaq has a market cap of around $25.6 trillion, meaning that Tesla's $144 billion market cap gain on Monday contributed around a 0.36% return to the S&P 500 and a 0.56% return to the Nasdaq. The fact that a single company can move two of the largest and most followed indexes by that much in a single day is a testament to how large Tesla has become.
To grow from here, Tesla must maintain its industry-leading operating margin and torrid top-line growth rate. It's a lot to ask an automaker to maintain high profitability as it releases lower-priced vehicles. For example, Honda Motor, Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford Motor Company, and even Toyota tend to pocket less than $0.10 on the dollar in earnings before interest and taxes. By comparison, Tesla had an operating margin of 15% for the third quarter. The full-year 2021 numbers aren't out yet, but there's a good chance Tesla will finish the year as the most efficient automaker when it comes to converting sales to earnings.
Even if Tesla continues growing at a fast clip, it will eventually need to bridge the gap between its market cap and its earnings, as evidenced by its price-to-earnings ratio. Mega-cap tech stocks like Microsoft and Meta Platforms have helped to lead the Nasdaq higher in recent years because they are fast growers, generate a lot of positive free cash flow, and are incredibly profitable businesses. Tesla could very well continue to contribute to Nasdaq gains in the future. But it's going to have to push its already high bar even higher.
Hitting its stride
Howard Smith: Tesla stock may have grown to be well overvalued by traditional metrics, but its business has grown along with it. Tesla closed 2021 with nearly 1 million vehicles delivered. And with two new Gigafactories under construction in Texas and near Berlin, Germany, respectively, it could have the capacity to produce 2 million vehicles by the end of 2022.
With capacity looking to double in another year, and market demand far outstripping supply, Tesla's business looks like it could just be hitting its stride in the next year or two. As investors and the market are forward-looking, there's good reason to think that Tesla could still lead the Nasdaq higher next year.
After an exponential jump in 2020, Tesla shares have increased a little more than 60% in the last 12 months. That came as production and revenue continued to move steadily higher, as seen below.
METRIC 2021 2020 2019
Total deliveries 936,172 499,550 367,500
Total revenue
$50+ billion*
$31.5 billion $24.6 billion
Data source: Tesla financial statements. *Estimate.
With its rate of production expected to double in another year, and no lack of demand in sight, the stock doesn't necessarily have a short-term downside. In a note to clients, widely followed Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives recently reiterated his firm's $1,400 price target on Tesla shares, according to EV news site Electrek. That would represent another 22% rise in Tesla stock from its recent price. And Ives believes there's an even more bullish case for shares to reach $1,800.
As long as demand continues to soar -- and there's no reason to think otherwise right now -- Tesla could keep pulling the Nasdaq higher. While competition is progressing, it will take years for any new players to match Tesla's production capacity. Unless Tesla's internal operations stumble, or there is an unexpected slowdown in demand for EVs, Tesla's stock is set to keep heading skyward.
A tall order
Tesla stock is still up year to date, but it can't move the Nasdaq alone. Wednesday's sell-off saw big names like Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Alphabet all fall between 3% and 5%. Nvidia, Salesforce, and Adobe all dropped between 5% and 8%. Tesla's size and leading position in the red-hot electric car industry have influence, but it's going to take a lot more than just Tesla for the Nasdaq to continue beating the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the years to come.

Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms (FB), and as part of the social media company's attempt to rebrand and reinvent itself, announced it would be focusing on the next ""next big thing"": the metaverse.
What is the metaverse? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a lengthy post about it, but one paragraph sums up his ambitions:
SEE MORE What Is the Metaverse (And How Can I Invest In It?)
""The next platform will be even more immersive – an embodied internet where you're in the experience, not just looking at it. We call this the metaverse, and it will touch every product we build.""
It's a grand vision, and a growing number of Wall Street executives have a similar vision or want to at least find a role for their companies in these new platforms. But where will the actual investing opportunities in the metaverse lie?
Let's dig into the technology itself, then talk about the potential players.
What Is the Metaverse?
At its highest level, the metaverse is a virtual, online world. A digital space. It mirrors real life, but it isn't restricted by the rules of the real world.

You would interface with the metaverse using hardware such as your PC or smartphone, along with accessories such as virtual reality (VR) headsets and controllers. As a person with a presence in the metaverse, you would have an avatar (some sort of animated character) that visually represents you. Expect to be able to pay to ""upgrade"" that avatar, with virtual clothing and other options. The real world doesn't apply here, so you may be able to shell out for working wings, or that impossible physique. There will be virtual neighborhoods with virtual homes and virtual cars.
You won't just be chatting up your social media friends in the metaverse. You'll be shopping, visiting global attractions, and attending concerts. It's also possible you could be attending classes and even interacting with co-workers, like Zoom (ZM) on steroids. At some point, you may actually make your living in the metaverse, selling digital services or products.
Still having trouble visualizing the metaverse? In terms of where this could ultimately go, think of movies like Ready Player One that envision a future where people primarily interact with each other online, in a virtual world.
The real world is still there, but many people prefer to spend as much time as possible in the metaverse.
When Will the Metaverse Arrive?
It's already here; Meta is merely trying to take the metaverse to the next level.

You might remember Second Life. This online world, where users can interact with each other and the world around them, launched in 2003 and still boasts hundreds of thousands of users. Second Life even was name-dropped by The Office, when it turned out that Dwight Schrute's Second Life alter ego was also a paper salesman named Dwight – but he could fly.
There have been many subsequent proto-metaverse offerings including Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, World of Warcraft, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Several of these are already hosting online concerts.
The list is heavy on video games but more recently we've seen expansion into other areas. For example, Nvidia (NVDA) created Omniverse, a shared virtual universe with virtual versions of real-life factories and buildings that's being used for design collaboration. Microsoft (MSFT) is preparing to roll out Mesh for Microsoft Teams, a combination of its mixed reality Mesh platform and Teams remote collaboration software. The company calls this ""a gateway to the metaverse.""
The metaverse as the platform envisioned by Mark Zuckerberg and others is not going to simply arrive one day. The foundations are already here and being built upon constantly. Instead of a launch, expect the metaverse to evolve from existing and future services.
A multiverse of metaverses, if you will.
As they become more capable and then begin to interconnect, the true metaverse will become reality.
How Can You Invest in the Metaverse?
These are early days, and that makes it difficult to divine which companies might strike gold with the metaverse.

We've created a list of top early stock picks in the metaverse space, but if you want to know broadly where to keep your eyes peeled, consider these possibilities.
Retail, believe it or not, could find a place in the metaverse. ""The next Amazon?"" Maybe not. But a company selling virtual goods, or offering a killer virtual shopping experience for real-life products, could make hay. (And before you go thinking about that viral Walmart VR shopping video, know that it's actually from 2017!)
Clothing and style brands are already staking out territory. Nike (NKE) has filed a series of patents aimed at making it the king of virtual sneakers and clothing in the metaverse.
Tech companies will be working hard on accessories that take the metaverse experience to the next level. Think next-gen VR headsets, controllers and other equipment. Among current players with affordable, consumer-focused sets are Meta and its Oculus Quest, Sony (SNE) and its PlayStation VR, and HP (HPQ) and its Reverb.
No matter who ends up driving development of the metaverse and what form it ultimately takes, we know that the No. 1 requirement is going to be unprecedented computing power – power that will largely have to come from the cloud. That means potential opportunities for Amazon.com's (AMZN) AWS and Microsoft's Azure, among others.
You could go a level deeper and look at the companies producing the high-powered silicon needed to power those servers, such as Nvidia.
The other given in the terms of the metaverse is that access will need high internet speeds with zero latency. Nothing will torpedo a metaverse experience more than low resolutions and lag. Broadband and  5G network providers are part of the equation; however, the critical piece of the puzzle is likely to be content delivery networks (CDNs). Companies such as Fastly (FSLY) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM) operate data centers across the globe that cache frequently accessed content. Local users are able to access this content much faster than if they were connected directly to a service like Netflix (NFLX) or Amazon from halfway across the globe. CDNs saw their business explode during the pandemic as everyone went online; that might prove to be a blip compared to the demands of the metaverse.
Entertainment companies are working on their strategies. For example, in February, Disney (DIS) hired a new VP to oversee its metaverse ambitions. Their task according to Disney's CEO will be ""connecting the physical and digital worlds"" for Disney entertainment. With Disney involved in theme parks, the movie business, and streaming video, getting the metaverse right has high stakes.
Other opportunities might evolve over time, just as the metaverse itself does. The key to investing in this space will be to remain nimble, but also realistic.
Because the metaverse has become an instant buzzword, scores of companies are going to try to hop on board and connect their names with this emerging technology. But only some will actually execute and provide shareholders with tangible returns.

CES 2022 — the consumer electronics industry’s most important annual event — has just wrapped up in Las Vegas. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock announced new mobile GPUs as well as the eagerly anticipated Ryzen 6000 series laptop processors.
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
AMD has been trouncing rival Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in recent years, gaining computer processor market share at Intel’s expense as that company floundered. AMD has hit an all-time high share of laptop processor market share and the Ryzen 6000 CPUs have been seen as the key to accelerating that growth. However, AMD stock slumped by over 7% during the week.
In contrast, INTC stock has popped. What’s going on here? Did AMD drop the ball with its new Ryzen chips? Here’s an overview of what went down at CES 2022, why Intel is suddenly in the spotlight, and why there’s no need for AMD investors to panic.
Intel Fights Back
Going back to 2016, Intel dominated the market for computer processors. Globally, 82.5% of computers sold were equipped with Intel CPUs. AMD had just 17.5% of the market. 2016 was a critical year for AMD.

However, that December, the company announced a new series of processors called Ryzen. AMD’s new chips slowly began to eat away at Intel’s lead. AMD relentlessly improved and moved forward with advanced chips while Intel began to fall behind in its release schedule. As Ryzen chips got better, Intel suffered a corporate meltdown, chewing through CEOs and delaying new processor releases.
By last November, AMD had capitalized on Intel’s flailing to the point that its computer CPU market share reached the highest level since 2006. Worse for Intel, AMD was now making big inroads in the laptop market. Powered by the Ryzen 5000 mobile processors revealed at last year’s CES 2021, AMD’s share hit 22% — an all-time high — at a time when remote working has goosed laptop sales. The Ryzen 6000 series made its debut at CES 2022. However, this time Intel had an answer.
Intel unveiled 12th generation Intel Core mobile processors that employ a new hybrid architecture. Intel claims this is the biggest leap forward for its chips in a decade. The company immediately laid claim to having the world’s fastest laptop processor in the Core i9-12900HK.
The market reacted by punishing AMD stock, and giving INTC a bump.
CES Innovation Awards Chose AMD, Not Intel 
Where things get interesting are the CES Innovation awards. Every year, the Consumer Technology Association announces Innovation awards for “outstanding” products shown at that year’s CES. The judges include consumer technology engineers, designers, and media representatives.
At CES 2022, the AMD Ryzen 6000 series mobile processors received an Innovation award. Among the reasons listed for the recognition was the fact that the Ryzen 6000 series laptop chips are the first to be equipped with integrated graphics that are powerful enough to play demanding PC game titles without the need for a standalone GPU.
Intel’s new hybrid 12th generation Core processors failed to score a mention. It’s possible that Intel chose not to enter them in the competition. However, Intel did win a CES 2022 Innovation award for its Thunderbolt 4 connectivity standard. So the company was participating.
Is there a takeaway here? Intel’s dramatic mobile processor reveal made headlines, but the tech insiders are still looking at AMD’s Ryzen laptop chips as the horse to beat. 
Intel Will Take on AMD and Nvidia
Adding to the pro-Intel sentiment was news at CES 2022 that computer OEMs now have access to Intel’s new Arc GPUs.
For decades, the computer graphics card market has been split between AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Now Intel is entering the fray. Of the two GPU makers, Nvidia should probably be the most worried about this development. AMD and Intel both make computer CPUs, so they can integrate their own GPUs in their processors. They also have an opportunity to bundle their processors and graphics cards with OEMs.
Not surprisingly, NVDA stock was also down through CES 2022.   
Bottom Line
AMD stock has performed spectacularly since the company began its resurgence in late 2016. Over the past five years, it’s delivered a return of 1,187%. 
That being said, Intel is showing signs of finally getting its act together, and that is likely to mean challenging times ahead. I don’t think anyone’s expecting Intel to start pulling market share from AMD on the computer processor front. AMD’s Ryzen chips are extremely popular these days. However, Intel’s turnaround efforts are likely to slow AMD’s heady gains in recent years. 
As for Intel’s entry into the graphics card market, that’s a wait and see situation. The first generation Arc GPUs are going to have a hard time competing against the best from AMD and Nvidia. They’ll also have a battle winning over consumers and software developers who need to write drivers to optimize their performance.
The bottom line is this Portfolio Grader “B” rated stock is still positioned for long-term growth. The qualifier is that Intel is shaping up to be a serious competitor once again. If it succeeds, Intel’s recovery could well have the effect of keeping AMD stock growth at lower rates than the numbers investors have been enjoying in recent years.

2022-01-11 00:00:00+00:00,Will Investors See a Tech Sector Market Top in 2022?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-investors-see-a-tech-sector-market-top-in-2022,"The tech sector is extremely broad. It is filled with trillion-dollar behemoths like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), legacy providers like IBM (NYSE: IBM), and fast-growing upstarts like Crowdstrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). It spans hardware, software, cybersecurity, financial technology, and more.
As such, 2021 could have either been a rough ride or a massive success for tech stock investors, depending on which market corner they were focused on. But overall, the tech sector did well -- much like it had over the past decade. Will 2022 be the year where it runs out of steam?

Top-heavy dominance
The S&P 500 (NYSEMKT: SPY) is market-cap weighted, so the largest companies by valuation have much greater impacts on the index's movement. Out of the top 10 companies in it, seven are tech players, and they make up around 25% of the entire index's value. As a group, those seven companies had a fairly remarkable 2021, though two did underperform the market.
Total Return Level data by YCharts
When 25% of the S&P 500 has a great year, it makes sense the entire index will follow. Should these companies falter, they will drag the market down with them. However, these seven companies have had the business growth to back up their share price gains.
Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts
Each has been capturing the opportunity in front of it, and there is little reason to expect that will change significantly this year. If these seven continue succeeding, the tech sector as a whole will continue its success during 2022.
The high flyers
In contrast to the largest and most well-known tech companies, a cohort of high-growth, unprofitable tech businesses delivered terrible results for investors in 2021. Cathie Wood's ARKK Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKK) invests in many of these stocks, and it fell by 23% over the last year. Valuations for companies such as Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), Twilio (NYSE: TWLO), and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) have cratered, and many of their tech brethren have fared poorly also.
PS Ratio data by YCharts
In many cases, their valuations have returned to pre-pandemic levels. This is because revenues are catching up to the price movement, normalizing the stocks' price-to-sales ratios.
COMPANY SHARE PRICE AS OF THE END OF Q3 2020 Q3 2020 TTM SALES Q3 2020 P/S RATIO CURRENT SHARE PRICE Q3 2021 TTM SALES CURRENT P/S RATIO
Roku $188.80 $1.540 billion 15.17 $227.93 $2.549 billion 9.67
Twilio $247.09 $1.545 billion 22.39 $262.34 $2.547 billion 15.05
MercadoLibre $1,082.48 $3.320 billion 16.14 $1,129.69 $6.265 billion 8.62
Source: Macrotrends. Stock prices listed are as of Sept. 30, 2020, and Jan. 7, 2022. P/S = Price to sales. TTM = Trailing 12 months.
Now that their valuations have fallen, the stocks' movements should be more correlated to quarterly results. Because of this, I believe these high-growth stocks should see a solid year in 2022, as these companies' market opportunities haven't been fulfilled. However, with the Fed poised to begin increasing the benchmark fed funds interest rate from its current extremely low level, investor appetite for unprofitable companies is likely to begin deteriorating. Macroeconomic events may have a larger impact on these companies' stocks than their own results, further complicating their investment theses.
Are pandemic changes here to stay?
Many thought the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic was over as 2020 drew to a close; 2021 proved that wrong. While nobody knows for sure what 2022 has in store, two years of remote work have changed how businesses operate. Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) have decided to let employees work from home forever if they want to, while many others companies' management teams are taking a hybrid approach.
As such, digital collaboration tools have never been more important. Although the initial stock hype has worn off for Zoom Video (NASDAQ: ZM) and DocuSign (NASDAQ: DOCU), they have become ingrained in the workflows of vast numbers of organizations. As a result, businesses will likely continue their usage. Additionally, each has a knack for expanding customer spending.
COMPANY Q3 NET RETENTION RATE
Zoom Video 130%-plus
DocuSign 121%
Source: Zoom Video and DocuSign
For every dollar the average customer spent in Q3 2020 with Zoom Video and DocuSign, they now spend at least 30 cents and 21 cents more, respectively. Companies that can drive growth because of how integral their products are to their clients' operations will not see a market top. Those that offer solutions that are not as necessary will struggle if businesses start calling everyone back into their offices.
Will the tech sector reach a top in 2022?
As the tailwinds toward a more digital society intensify, the companies providing these solutions will succeed. While there may be some struggles within the tech sector, overall, I expect it to continue growing into 2022 and beyond. Many individual stocks can be selected to play this sector in 2022, or an ETF approach can give an investor immediate diversification.
An unforeseen event -- such as the advent of the pandemic was in 2020 -- could derail any 2022 predictions. As a result, any stock picks made should be held for at least three years to ride out any market volatility. Tech has led the way for many years, and I see no reason to doubt that it will continue to.

2022-01-12 00:00:00+00:00,3 Under-the-Radar Auto Technology Stocks to Watch in 2022,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-under-the-radar-auto-technology-stocks-to-watch-in-2022,"With the internal combustion engine no longer the sole option for power, the vehicle is being completely reimagined. Dozens of electric vehicle maker start-ups have appeared to capitalize on this coming sea change. But a slew of new auto parts manufacturers and service providers are also appearing to help meet the need for automotive technology, and many of them could be even more profitable investments than the automakers themselves.
Two small auto tech companies that investors should keep an eye on are Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ: LAZR) and Ambarella (NASDAQ: AMBA). In addition, tech giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) has been quietly building its presence in the automotive space, and looks like a great buy right now.

Luminar Technologies: Crawling toward a viable vehicle autonomy business
Lidar technology specialist Luminar was off to the races following its IPO in late 2020, but the stock spent much of 2021 in steady decline as investors' excessive early optimism gradually wore off. Lidar (which stands for ""light detection and ranging"") uses lasers to help a vehicle ""see"" what's around it, and could feature prominently in the systems that eventually allow for fully self-driving cars. But for now, Luminar is a start-up that's working hard to develop its wares and secure deals with auto suppliers.
The financials tell the story right now. In the third quarter of 2021, Luminar's revenue was a mere $8 million, and it booked an adjusted net loss of $36 million. On its balance sheet, the company had $129 million in cash and another $416 million in short-term investments, so it has a few years' worth of liquidity to cover its losses as it attempts to develop into a viable business. But at this stage, valued at a market cap of $5.8 billion, Luminar is a high-risk investment.
So why keep tabs on Luminar? While I'm personally not ready to buy the stock yet, the company is making fast progress as automakers start to incorporate lidar technology into their advanced driver assist systems (ADAS). Revenue last quarter was up 89% year over year. And it was recently announced that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) had selected Luminar's lidar sensors to go into the Nvidia DRIVE Hyperion autonomous vehicle platform, an integrated computer and sensor suite that automakers can use to supply their vehicles with self-driving features. DRIVE Hyperion will go into production for 2024 model year cars.
Thus, Luminar is on a clear path to becoming a viable auto supplier business over the next couple of years. Investors will need to exercise some patience here, as a lot of hype is still priced into the stock. Nevertheless, this small business holds a lot of promise if it can continue to advance its lidar technology.
Ambarella: Computer vision is already in the works
Computer vision is an entirely different type of technology that is helping enable autonomous vehicles. It uses digital cameras to capture video, which is processed by high-end system-on-a-chip hardware and artificial intelligence software to allow vehicles to safely navigate the roads. Ambarella specializes in the design of these image processing chips.
Computer vision is already in use in some ADAS platforms -- including Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) self-driving system -- as well as in other devices like security cameras. But Ambarella is still early in the process of developing hardware for the more advanced systems that will unlock progressively more autonomous cars -- and eventually, ones that require no human input. Still, its financial results are already benefiting. Through the first nine months of 2021, revenue was up 50% year over year to $242 million.
As more automakers put Ambarella's technology to use in the coming years, its currently small sales base could expand dramatically. (Top semiconductor companies book billions of dollars in annual revenues.) That upbeat thesis is currently priced into the stock. Even after a more than 30% pullback in recent months, Ambarella trades for more than 19 times its trailing-12-month sales and nearly 120 times its adjusted net income. (Most of the company's excess cash is being spent on research and development right now.)
Given the high price tag, I'd tread very lightly with this semiconductor stock at the moment. Nevertheless, Ambarella could be a top player in automotive technology in the decade ahead. It's prone to wild swings in price, so keep this stock on your list of buy-the-dip candidates.
Qualcomm: The next frontier for mobility
Nearly every smartphone on the planet has a piece of Qualcomm-designed electronics in it. Through the 2000s and 2010s, Qualcomm's chips contributed to the boom in computing mobility from smartphones and telecom services. In recent years, the industry has matured, and this semiconductor stock has become more of a value play.
But Qualcomm has been steadily gearing up for the next wave of mobile computing, and it has the modern car squarely in its sights. In fact, during its fiscal 2021, which ended Sept. 26, Qualcomm reported $975 million in sales to the auto industry. For perspective, that was only about 3% of the company's total revenue. However, it was a 51% year-over-year increase, and with new cars getting enabled with everything from ADAS features to mobile network connectivity, Qualcomm thinks that great things could be in store for it in this segment.
To that end, Qualcomm recently reached an agreement to acquire the automotive software segment of auto technology supplier Veoneer (NYSE: VNE), presumably in a bid to make its mobile hardware easier to implement. And at CES 2022 this month, Qualcomm discussed its current capabilities and future plans for the ""software-defined vehicle"" -- features that span continuous connectivity and monitoring, ADAS processors, in-cabin infotainment, and a cloud platform that will make updates of vehicles' software easier.
Qualcomm already boasts a top ecosystem for smartphone manufacturers, and its expansion into the automotive world is well underway. The company expects to grow at a healthy pace, and anticipates that its total addressable market will grow at an average percentage rate in the low teens over the next few years. Trading at 24.5 times trailing-12-month free cash flow as of this writing, Qualcomm looks like a great under-the-radar way to invest in the ongoing advancement of automotive technology.

2022-01-13 00:00:00+00:00,PREVIEW-Investors ready for U.S. earnings as inflation worries run high,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/preview-investors-ready-for-u.s.-earnings-as-inflation-worries-run-high-0,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - U.S. companies will post results in the coming weeks on the final quarter of 2021 as investors worry about inflation's impact on earnings and pressure on the Federal Reserve to speed up the timeline for kicking off interest rate hikes.
The concerns, along with caution tied to the fast-spreading COVID-19 Omicron variant, have driven a recent market sell-off, led by Nasdaq and shares of technology and other big growth companies that have benefited from low interest rates.
Year-over-year profit growth for S&P 500 companies is expected to be lower in the fourth quarter than it was in first three quarters of 2021 but still strong at 22.4%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Huge profit gains earlier in 2021 were fueled by a rebound from the economic downturn in the early stages of the pandemic.
It's ""nearing the end of the very easy comparisons that we had relative to 2020,"" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""Those easy comparisons will begin to wane as we move into 2022.""
Last year's strong market performance - with the S&P 500 .SPX gaining 26.9% for the year - was on the back of massive profit growth, so corporate outlooks for 2022 will be key this earnings period, Northey said.
Earnings growth for all of 2021 is estimated at about 50% compared with 8.6% for 2022, while the forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 was last at 21.7, compared with its long-term average of 15.5, according to Refinitiv DataStream.
JPMorgan Chase JPM.N is due to report Friday and will kick off the reporting period along with Citigroup C.N and Wells Fargo WFC.N.
Heading into earnings season, bank shares have rallied with U.S. Treasury yields as focus has turned to rate hike expectations.
Analysts expect big U.S. banks to show an increase in fourth-quarter core revenues, thanks to new lending and rising Treasury yields.
Both the S&P 500 bank index .SPXBK and financial index .SPSY hit record highs last week. Minutes released last week from the Fed's December meeting showed some policymakers want to tighten policy even faster.
With inflation among their top worries, investors will also watch for signs supply chain bottlenecks may be easing. U.S. economic reports have offered some hope on that front.
Last week's report on U.S. services industry activity included tentative signs the supply logjam in that sector is starting to break up.
Transportation snags at ports and other areas have led to bigger expenses for companies and higher costs for consumers.
Bottlenecks have hit retailers especially hard, and investors will watch for how they affected holiday sales.
S&P 500 companies have been maintaining record profit margins, with many able to pass on higher expenses to customers, but that may not continue.
""We expect margins not to be a record this quarter"" but still high, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices in New York.
The stock market has seen investors rotating out of technology-heavy growth shares and into more value-oriented stocks that tend to do better in a higher interest-rate environment. Still, some investors say technology company results could be much better than Wall Street expects.
Results from big tech and other mega-cap companies start next week, with Netflix NFLX.O due to report on Jan 20.
Recent results from some chip companies including Micron Technology MU.Owere upbeat, said Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta, Georgia.
""That gives me confidence we should get good reports out of the chips sector,"" he said. ""I'm optimistic.""
Energy, materials and industrials sectors are expected to post the biggest year-over-year earnings gains in the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv data.
Energy has been by far the strongest S&P 500 sector performer in early 2022, with the S&P 500 energy index .SPNY up about 14% since Dec. 31, supported by tight supply, following a whopping 48% gain in 2021.
Results from oil majors ExxonMobil XOM.N and Chevron CVX.N are due in a couple of weeks.
But all 11 of the S&P 500 sectors are slated to show profit growth for the fourth quarter of 2021, while revenue growth for the period is seen at 12.1%. That growth level would also be lower than in recent quarters, based on Refinitiv data.

Semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), a powerhouse in the graphics processing units used to power video games, is enjoying a modest bump in early trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market this morning. As of 10:18 a.m. ET, Nvidia shares are up 2.1%.
You can probably thank Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for that. And Fortnite.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
You've heard about the legal rumble that erupted between Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games in 2020, right? How the former enjoyed charging the latter 30% of revenue every time a gamer made an in-game purchase using an iPhone -- but the latter didn't enjoy this nearly so much?
When Epic rebelled against this payments system, and introduced a method permitting gamers to pay it directly for in-game purchases (cutting Apple out of the loop), Apple retaliated by banning new Fortnite downloads from its App Store, setting the stage for an ""epic"" lawsuit against Apple. Ever since, it's been impossible to download Fortnite on an iPhone or iPad -- but thanks to Nvidia, you may not need to anymore.
As Gizmodo reported yesterday afternoon, Epic and Nvidia have teamed up to exploit a loophole to Apple's Fortnite app ban. By subscribing to Nvidia's GeForce Now service on Safari, gamers will soon be able to use Apple's Safari browser on their iPhones to play Fortnite via Nvidia's service. In this way, says Gizmodo, GeForce Now subscribers should have ""full functionality"" playing Fortnite on an iPhone or iPad. Indeed, Gizmodo notes that GeForce Now is ""specifically optimized for mobile devices.""
Now what
At last report, GeForce Now boasted 12 million subscribers -- and was growing 33% annually. Nvidia's opportunistic alliance with Epic to get around Apple's Fortnite ban promises to boost that subscriber number even more. As Techacake.com confirms, ""Fortnite is [still] the most popular battle royale game in 2022,"" with as many as ""4 million concurrent players every day,"" and ""more than 80.4 million Fortnite monthly active users.""
Granted, not all these users will now immediately begin playing Fortnite on Apple devices. (In fact, GeForce Now's Fortnite service is actually only in beta right now, with a waitlist to sign up.)
Granted, too, most GeForce Now subscribers who do sign up won't be paying subscribers, having signed up for the free version of the service instead. Still, investors can probably safely assume that Nvidia will add at least some new subscribers from this move -- subscribers it wouldn't have gotten but for the Apple-Epic legal kerfuffle. That's an incremental positive for Nvidia stock, and a decent justification for today's modest rise in stock price.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-01-19 00:00:00+00:00,"With Bitcoin At $43,000, Check Out These Crypto Stocks",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/with-bitcoin-at-%2443000-check-out-these-crypto-stocks,"Cryptocurrencies have seen a lot of volatility in recent weeks. Bellweather crypto, Bitcoin, has seen prices plummet by almost 10% year-to-date, to levels of about $43,000 currently, and also remains down by almost 33% from all-time highs seen in November 2021. The decline is likely driven by expectations of tighter U.S. monetary policy as the Federal Reserve plans multiple rate hikes for this year, as inflation soars to near 40-year highs. Moreover, the recent uncertainty following the surge in Covid-19 cases (U.S. daily cases averaged over 800,000 last week), amid the spread of the highly infectious omicron coronavirus variant, is also adding to the negative sentiment.
Our theme of Cryptocurrency Stocks which includes semiconductors, payments, and brokerage companies, enables investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency value chain without betting on the volatile cryptocurrencies themselves. Although the theme remains down by about 8% thus far in 2022, compared to the S&P 500 which is down by about 2% over the same period, it fared very well through the Covid-19 pandemic, returning about 192% in 2020 and about 25% in 2021. The theme has also been much less volatile over time, with average drawdowns over the last five years standing at just about -10%, compared to drawdowns on the S&P 500 which have averaged around -15%.
Within our theme, semiconductor major Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been the strongest performer in recent quarters, with its stock rising by about 55% over the last 12 months. On the other side, digital payments player PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been the worst performer, with its stock down by about 26% over the last 12 months.
Below you’ll find our previous coverage of the cryptocurrency theme where you can track our view over time.
[10/15/2021] With Bitcoin At $60K, Consider These Crypto Stocks
Bitcoin prices have rallied by almost 25% over the last month, trading at about $59,600 as of late Thursday. The bellwether crypto has rallied from lows of under $30,000 in July. There are likely a couple of factors driving the recent gains. Firstly, there has been some anticipation that a Bitcoin futures ETF could be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shortly. Moreover, the chairman of the Federal Reserve clarified that he has no intention to ban cryptocurrencies in the U.S, easing concerns in the market following China’s recent crackdown on cryptocurrency. However, despite the recent rally, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets have proved very volatile.
Investors looking to play the long-term upside in cryptocurrency adoption, without exposing themselves to the big swings in the crypto market, should take a look at our indicative theme on Cryptocurrency Stocks which includes semiconductors, payments, and brokerage companies that have exposure to the cryptocurrency value chain. The theme has gained a solid 30% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 18% over the same period. The theme has also been less volatile, with maximum drawdowns over the three years standing at just about -20%. Within the theme, graphics processor major Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has fared the best, with its stock rising by 66% year-to-date. On the other hand, exchange major CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) has been the weakest performer in our theme, rising by just about 13% over the same period.
[9/27/2021] Bitcoin Falls On China’s Crypto Crackdown. Are These Crypto Stocks Better Picks?
Bitcoin prices have declined by almost 7% since Friday, to levels of around $42,000 a unit although it recovered a bit over the weekend. The cryptocurrency also remains down by about 11% over the past month. The recent volatility comes as China’s central bank announced that all cryptocurrency transactions in the country were illegal. While a ban on crypto trading came into effect in China in 2019, it apparently continued via offshore exchanges. With the latest developments, crypto trading of all forms is likely to be shut down in China, and this likely caused liquidation of cryptos, putting pressure on prices.
While China’s crypto crackdown is a setback, it probably doesn’t change the course for the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies, which have the potential to be one of the most disruptive technologies of our time.  Investors who want to play the long-term upside in cryptocurrency adoption, without exposing themselves to this sort of volatility in crypto pricing, should take a look at our indicative theme on Cryptocurrency Stocks which includes semiconductors, payments, and brokerage companies that have exposure to the cryptocurrency value chain. The theme has gained roughly 27% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 19% over the same period. Within our theme, graphics processor major Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has fared the best, with its stock rising by 69% year-to-date. On the other hand, exchange major CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) has been the worst performer in our theme, rising by just about 9% over the same period.
[8/23/2021] With Bitcoin Back At $50K, Consider These Crypto Stocks
Bitcoin prices have been on a wild ride this year. While prices for the bellwether cryptocurrency more than doubled to levels of around $65,000 between early January and mid-April 2021, driven by higher institutional interest, prices fell back to levels of just under $30,000 as of mid-July, due to China’s crackdown on Bitcoin trading and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s increasingly hawkish stance. However, the currency has recovered swiftly from the recent lows, rising by about 65% since July 20th, and trades at about $50,000 currently. The recent recovery is apparently driven by factors including short-covering, as well as signs that the U.S. SEC was increasingly open to allowing Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.
Investors who want to play the long-term gains in cryptos, without exposing themselves to the volatility and boom and bust cycles in cryptocurrency pricing, should take a look at our indicative theme on Cryptocurrency Stocks which includes semiconductors, payments, and brokerage companies that have exposure to the cryptocurrency value chain. The theme has gained roughly 24% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 19% over the same period. Within our theme, graphics processor major Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has fared the best, with its stock rising by 59% year-to-date, driven by strong demand for its chips as well as its recent stock split. On the other side, exchange major CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) has been the worst performer in our theme, rising by just about 9% over the same period.
[7/1/2021] Bitcoin Prices Crash
Bitcoin prices have crashed from levels of around $62,000 in mid-April to just about $34,000 as of Wednesday. The crypto bear market appears to be driven by a host of factors, including China’s crackdown on Bitcoin trading and mining and Tesla’s unexpected reversal of its decision on accepting the digital currency as payment for its cars. Moreover, the U.S. Federal Reserve has turned increasingly hawkish following its mid-June meeting indicating that it could start hiking interest rates from 2023, rather than 2024. This is also likely putting pressure on non-productive assets such as cryptocurrency.
Now, although the market sentiment for cryptos, in general, is clearly bearish, cryptocurrencies have the potential to be one of the most disruptive technologies of our time. Moreover, with increasing institutional interest, they appear to be here to stay as an asset class. Investors who want to play the long-term gains in cryptos, without exposing themselves to the volatility and boom and bust cycles in cryptocurrency pricing, should take a look at our indicative theme on Cryptocurrency Stocks which includes semiconductors, payments, and brokerage companies that have exposure to the cryptocurrency value chain. The theme has gained roughly 22% year-to-date, compared to the Nasdaq-100, which has returned about 15% over the same period. Within our theme, graphics processor major  Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has fared the best, with its stock rising by 53% year-to-date, driven by strong demand for its chips as well as its planned stock split. On the other side, processor major Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been the worst performer, with its stock up by just about 2% this year.
[4/5/2021] Crypto Stocks To Watch
Cryptocurrency prices have surged this year. Crypto bellwether Bitcoin has almost doubled year-to-date to levels of about $60k as of the end of last week, as more institutional investors warm up to the currency, with companies such as Tesla also indicating that they will accept bitcoin payments from customers. However, investing in Bitcoin and other cryptos is risky at current levels. With Covid-19 cases on the decline and vaccination rates in the U.S. rising, the economic outlook is improving. Bond yields are also trending higher, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rising from around 1% earlier this year to close to 1.70% currently. Considering this, investors are moving funds back to real-economy sectors, and it’s likely that non-productive assets such as Bitcoin will eventually be impacted. Our indicative theme on Cryptocurrency Stocks could be a safer way to play the long-term upside from cryptocurrencies, without taking a position in individual currencies. The theme, which includes semiconductor, payments, and brokerage companies that have exposure to the cryptocurrency value chain, is up by about 122% since 12/31/2019, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 24%. Here is a look at the recent developments for some of the stocks in our theme.
PayPal (PYPL), a large online payments processor, allows customers to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies. The company has taken this a step further, launching its “Checkout with Crypto” service last week, enabling U.S. customers to use their crypto holdings to pay at millions of online merchants worldwide.
Nvidia (NVDA) indicated a few weeks ago, that it would be launching a GPU that was dedicated to mining cryptocurrencies. Nvidia has seen gaming GPU shortages in the past, as its gaming processors were being used to mine cryptocurrency. The move should let the company better target the crypto mining space, while potentially alleviating GPU shortages for gaming.
CME Group (CME), a derivatives exchange, plans to launch new Micro Bitcoin futures from early May, subject to regulatory approval. The smaller-sized futures contracts are a tenth of the size of one Bitcoin and will be targeted at institutions and sophisticated traders.
[3/16/2021] Crypto Stocks To Watch As Bitcoin Nears $55k
Cryptocurrency prices have surged this year, with Bitcoin now up by around 90% since early January, trading at levels of around $55k currently. However, Bitcoin looks quite risky at current levels due to a couple of factors. With Covid-19 cases on the decline, the economic outlook is improving and bond yields are also on the rise. Considering this, investors are likely to start moving funds back to real-economy sectors, and non-productive assets such as Bitcoin, which rallied big through the pandemic, could be impacted. Our indicative theme on Cryptocurrency Stocks could be a safer way to play the long-term upside from cryptocurrencies, without taking a position in individual currencies. The theme, which includes semiconductor, payments, and brokerage companies that have exposure to the cryptocurrency value chain, is up by about 124% since 12/31/2019, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 22%. Year-to-date, the theme is up by 4%, compared to the S&P 500 which is up around 5%. Within our theme, digital payments player Square (SQ) has been the strongest performer, rising by 287% since the end of 2019, while exchange major CME Group (CME) has been the worst performer in our theme, rising by just about 4% over the same period.
[2/18/2021] Which Stocks Should You Buy As Bitcoin Hits $50k?
Cryptocurrency have continued their surge this year, driven by retail and institutional interest. While the crypto market bellwether Bitcoin has soared 5x over the last 12 months and by almost 80% year-to-date, lesser-known crypto Dogecoin is up by over 10x year-to-date.  To be sure, these currencies remain a risky investment, given their relative lack of utility and extremely high volatility. Our indicative theme on Cryptocurrency Stocks – which includes semiconductors, payments, and brokerage companies that have exposure to the cryptocurrency value chain – could be a safer way to play the crypto space, without taking a position in individual currencies. The theme has returned about 151% since the end of 2019, compared to about 22% for the S&P 500. The theme is also up 14% year-to-date, versus about 5% for the S&P 500. Payments player Square (SQ) remains the strongest performer in our theme, rising by over 330% since the end of 2019, driven by its Bitcoin exposure, and also by an increasing preference for digital payments among consumers and businesses. On the other side, financial exchange major CME Group (CME) has been the worst performer in our theme, down by about -5% over the same period.
[Updated 1/20/2021] Cryptocurrency Stocks 
Bitcoin prices have surged by more than 50% over the last month and remain up by about 4x over the 12 months, due to higher retail and institutional interest. That being said, Bitcoin remains a risky investment, given its relative lack of utility and extremely high volatility. Our indicative theme on Cryptocurrency Stocks – which includes semiconductor, payments, and brokerage companies that have some exposure to the cryptocurrency value chain – could be a safer way to play the crypto space, without betting on individual currencies. The theme has done well, rallying by over 100% over the last year. Below is a bit more about the key companies in the theme and how they have been faring.
Nvidia (NVDA) stock saw big gains over 2020, driven by growing demand for its GPUs from gaming consoles and data centers and its planned acquisition of CPU designer ARM. The company recently indicated that it could restart the production of dedicated crypto mining GPUs, which essentially remove the video outputs that are required for gaming.
Square (SQ) a payments company, allows users to buy and sell bitcoin via its Cash mobile payment application. The company said that bitcoin-related Revenue surged by about 8x over the first nine months of 2020 to around $2.8 billion.
PayPal (PYPL) a large online payments processor has also reported increasing engagement on its PayPay mobile app after it introduced support for bitcoin last October, with about half its crypto users opening the PayPal app daily.
CME Group (CME) the world’s largest financial derivatives exchange, also offers bitcoin futures contracts. The exchange has emerged as the world’s largest futures exchange for Bitcoin, with open interest – contracts traded but not squared off – for the cryptocurrency standing at $2.1 billion.
[Updated 12/7/2020] How Nvidia, Square & PayPal Stocks Are Benefiting From Soaring Bitcoin Prices
Bitcoin prices have surged by over 160% year-to-date, driven by multiple factors including higher institutional interest, fintech companies Paypal and Square’s moves into the crypto space, and also by a view that scarce digital currency could be a hedge against inflation and a weakening U.S. dollar. Our indicative theme on Cryptocurrency Stocks – which includes semiconductor, payments, and brokerage companies that have some exposure to the cryptocurrency space – is up a solid 110% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by just about 14% over the same period. Key stocks in our theme include Square (SQ), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and CME Group (CME).
Although crypto likely represents a small portion of these company’s revenues at the moment, it does have the potential to be big. For example, Payment apps Square and PayPal, who make money by buying bitcoin from brokers and selling them to their customers by adding a “spread” stand to benefit as prices and volumes rise. Square’s Cash App generated about $1.63 billion in Bitcoin-related sales in Q3 2020, an 11x jump year-over-year. Similarly, Nvidia (NVDA) also benefits from demand for its top-of-the-line GPUs such as the Ampere lineup from cryptocurrency miners.
[Updated 10/29/2020] Cryptocurrency Stocks To Watch
Interest in cryptocurrency is surging once again with Bitcoin prices up by almost 30% over the last month, driven by growing institutional interest and Paypal’s recent move to allow its customers to buy and sell certain cryptocurrencies.

This theme could be of interest to investors who are looking for upside from cryptocurrency adoption and prices, but want to avoid buying into the currencies themselves considering the volatility, risk of fraud, or cyber theft, or potential portfolio mandates. Below is a bit more about the stocks in our theme and how they have fared this year.
Square (SQ) cash mobile wallet app has emerged as a very popular way for people to buy and sell Bitcoin.

The metaverse is an emerging virtual world that allows people to socialize, conduct business and more in an interactive digital environment. Right now, the potential for this technology has major corporations vying with each other, trying not to get left behind as it becomes popularized by investors. In a world where people can’t get enough of cryptocurrencies, it seems like Decentraland (CCC:MANA-USD) is the perfect name to invest your hard-earned cash. The MANA token has seen spectacular gains this year, leaping into prominence among an increasing number of cryptocurrencies and platforms alike.

The metaverse is expanding at an unprecedented rate; new virtual platforms are created every day. Now, investment firms are flocking to this phenomenon. If you think the metaverse trend has passed its peak, think again. The concept is still new and the institutional interest is igniting. There are still plenty of opportunities out in the market.
Decentraland’s platform is one of the oldest and most well-known metaverse platforms out there. The potential for MANA is that it generates interest in blockchain-based metaverses. But it could also be a foundation leading to bigger things. This name’s first-mover advantage will help maintain its momentum throughout 2022. As such, risk-tolerant investors may want to dedicate a small portion of their portfolio to MANA. Here’s why.
Decentraland: Metaverse Is the Future of Marketing
The metaverse is a place with tons of freedom. So, with plenty of brands already in the virtual world, it’s only natural that more will join the metaverse soon. Right now, the concept itself is nascent. However, every investor knows that their most important job is to stay ahead of emerging trends.
7 Best Mutual Funds to Buy for the Coming Rate Hikes
Decentraland was founded in 2015 by Ari Meilich and Esteban Ordano. It is an open-source 3D virtual world platform that anyone can use for personal or commercial purposes. In 2017, the price of digital land on this platform was about $20 and its cryptocurrency traded for around 2 cents. The platform was opened to the public in February 2020 with supervision from Decentraland Foundation.
One major needle-mover for the price of MANA, however, has been fairly recent. The catalyst? Facebook decided to rebrand itself as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB). With that announcement, many wanted to purchase “land” with Decentraland to get exposure to the metaverse trend and potentially make money before it was too late. But the metaverse is more than a fad. After all, companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms obviously see value in this space.
Much of that has to do with a secular trend: everything is going digital. As we have seen during the pandemic, companies and individuals have had to adapt to digitalization moving forward. Going digital is inevitable — and also helps facilitate flexibility. When it comes to the metaverse, then, major companies and advertisers are now wanting their piece of the pie as well. In the past, Decentraland has collaborated with Samsung Electronics and the Australian Open. That’s just the beginning.
The Metaverse May Be the Foundation of the New Economy
Virtual reality (VR) is still in its infancy, true. But it’s also growing like wildfire, expanding day by day. And it can even change how people work. Specifically, the metaverse has so far revolutionized how 3D design teams can work together by connecting them digitally. Rather than meeting in person or exchanging files across distances, designers can collaboratively create content from anywhere at any time via the metaverse.
With that, it’s no surprise that the metaverse has been on many minds recently. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), in particular, is all-in on this concept. Founder and CEO Jensen Huang has an expansive vision for the technology — and hopes it will soon become integrated into our daily lives. Huang had the following to say:
“[T]he economy of the virtual world will be much, much bigger than the economy of the physical world. You’re going to have more cars built and designed in virtual worlds, you’ll have more buildings, more roads, more houses — more hats, more bags, more jackets.”
In my opinion, Meta Platforms has too many privacy issues and is not well-regarded in new markets. However, the idea of a world where people have complete input in how their society operates is part of what makes Decentraland so attractive. The fact that its governance decisions are made by those who own the coin creates an alignment between investor and generator; they both benefit from decentralized control. The metaverse is only going to get more popular. Companies know that. They’re investing in this space because they anticipate interest will continue to grow over time.
Decentraland and MANA Will Only Grow From Here
The MANA token has attracted attention and seen its valuation explode over the last year, thanks largely to speculation. Make no mistake, there is a lot of speculation in the market. People are hoping to make a quick buck and you can’t blame them. However, the metaverse should still only grow from here in the long run. The future of Decentraland is bright and inviting, with MANA standing out as a crypto that will be valuable for years to come.
The market has shown its power before when it comes to crypto. Incredible bull runs have rocketed coins higher and individual tokens have posted huge gains on little news. However, the metaverse will likely need to continue rapidly adding users while recording strong growth rates throughout this process. But that is possible given the current trajectory.
Take Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) for example. Roblox is a multiplayer social game where players can create and play in virtual worlds. The platform has grown steadily and currently has more than 47.3 million active users. Now take Decentraland, which has the potential to become more immersive than any other game out there. True, it has nowhere near the number of users as Roblox at this stage. However, moving forward, if it continues to gather steam, Decentraland can easily replicate the success of Roblox — and its rise will have much wider implications.
Decentraland Is Interesting to the Risk-Tolerant Investor
When I think about the metaverse, one word comes to mind: potential. There are so many opportunities in this new frontier that companies and developers alike are exploring. What’s more, crypto tokens offer investors a unique opportunity; they allow you to buy into early-stage technology and projects.
True, pricing is volatile and can fluctuate dramatically based on a platform’s progress (or lack thereof). That makes this asset class risky. But it also makes it potentially lucrative.
What if you could invest in the future of money? Recently, investments in crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have many people asking that same question. The MANA token, with its potential across many aspects of this space, might be worth considering as a way to diversify your portfolio across the board without taking on too much risk or sacrificing possible returns.
It’s easy to see why many people are excited about Decentraland. And it seems like MANA might be just the thing if you are looking for a high-risk, high-reward investment.

2022-01-21 00:00:00+00:00,7 Beaten-Down Semiconductor Stocks for Your Bargain-Buy List,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-beaten-down-semiconductor-stocks-for-your-bargain-buy-list,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Semiconductor stocks have seen solid returns in 2021. As a result, the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) is up around 12.5% in the past 12 months. Meanwhile, numbers from the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics show that global sales in the industry will likely grow close to 9% in 2022.
Yet, despite these positive prospects, many semiconductor stocks have started the new year on a down note. In fact, the widely-followed SOX index is down about 11.5% so far in January.
With the recent sell-off in leading names like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), chip investors are increasingly focusing on steady growers with more moderate valuations. In recent years, the Federal Reserve has helped boost semiconductor stocks with expansionist policies, but it is currently moving in the opposite direction.
As a result, capital is already moving away from tech to other sectors that benefit from higher interest rates. Investors can no longer rely on the soaring liquidity that has boosted the entire industry for the past few years.

Chris Hill: Today on Motley Fool Money from housing to office space, We'll take a look at real estate trends and investing opportunities to go along with them. All that and more coming up right now.
I'm Chris Hill, joined by Motley Fool Senior Analyst John Rotonti. Thanks for being here!
John Rotonti: Thanks for having me on the show, Chris!
Chris Hill: We've also got an update on semiconductors, but let's start with a big day in the housing industry. Shares of home builder KB Home up more than 12% this morning after 4th quarter profits came in solidly higher than expected. Revenue was a little light, but KB Home says that 2022 is going to be a good year. When you consider how much we've all been talking about supply chain issues, John, this guidance out of KB Home, I understand why the stock is up.
John Rotonti: I consider this a beat and raise quarter. Like you said, revenue was a little light, but they crushed earnings and then they raised their guidance. They're expecting guidance of midpoint 30% revenue growth for 2022. They've also increased their guidance for return on equity, which is a measure of profitability. In 2021, they did 20%, they're expecting to do 26%, so a 600 basis point improvement year over year. That's just incredible, and I think it shows the pricing power that homebuilders have right now, given the supply demand imbalance. If we go back to microeconomics 101, almost the first day of class, you learn about how supply and demand effects price, and right now, Freddie Mac estimates were 4 million homes short in the US, because we underbuilt coming out of the global financial crisis. I've seen estimates that were anywhere from four million to actually six million homes short at the same time that we're seeing a surge in demand, because millennials are now at that prime home buying age.
That on top of the fact that COVID and the pandemic has changed living patterns, and now people want to move outside of the cities. Some people want to move outside of the cities to more suburban rural areas where they have more room and more space to work from home, play from home, exercise from home in a socially distanced way. So the combination of massive shortage of supply and surging demand is giving homebuilders pricing power, and so we're seeing an increase in ASPs, average selling prices. Yeah, that's the story with KB Home, and hopefully this is a read through for the rest of the industry that the other homebuilders will have a good quarter as well.
Chris Hill: We'll get to the other homebuilders in a second. For a brief moment there, when they were talking about their guidance, I had this crazy idea that it meant good things for people looking to buy homes, because much like the used car market and therefore the new car market, the homebuying market has just been on fire. Anecdotally, I think we all know people out there who have tried to buy a new home, a bigger home, and have gotten priced out very quickly or ended up paying more than they probably would've in normal times. But to your point on the deficit in homes, it really does seem like when you're talking about nationwide, 4-6 million homes short. Are we going to see the housing market on fire like this for years to come or does it start to cool off at some point?
John Rotonti: There's two views to this. I do think that we're going to see an extended upcycle gross, an extended upcycle, because inventory is so low, because supply is so low. But if you look at where KB Home is trading, it's trading at a price to earnings ratio of six. That suggests that the market thinks we could be at peak earnings. It's an interesting enigma with the homebuilders right now. I'm of the view that we're going to see an extended upcycle for all the reasons we just discussed, the supply demand imbalance, but the market seems to think that we are approaching a peak and that earnings could start trailing off, because a PE of six it's the only explanation I can think of.
Chris Hill: Let's move to a homebuilder that is nearly 10 times the size of KB Home and that's Lennar. No earnings report out of Lennar, but they're increasing their annual dividend by 50%. How good are they at capital allocation? We've seen plenty of times where the news is someone is increasing their dividend by a penny, a couple of percentage points. You got to be confident if you're going to make this stick, if you're going up 50% for an annual dividend, right?
John Rotonti: This is a signal that the management team has a lot of confidence in the company's ability to generate strong and stable cash flows across the cycle so that they can sustain this dividend. No management team wants to have to reduce, suspend, or cut a dividend because that's going across stock no management team wants that and so yes, this is a signal that they think they're going to have really strong, robust cash flows going forward. It is a 50% increase. It's an increase I love to see, because this is a company that I actually admire a lot, Lennar. But to put it into perspective, their dividend payout ratio is very low. They had a lot of room to increase. Before this announcement, I think their dividend payout ratio was well less than 15%, meaning they're paying out less than 15% of their net income as a dividend. This increase will take Lennar's dividend yield, which is different than the payout ratio. The payout ratio is the%age of earnings that they pay out as a dividend. The yield is the dividend divided by the stock price. This will take their dividend yield from about 1% to about 1.4%. It is a nice boost in the dividend yield, but that dividend payout ratio is still very low, and so actually that indicates they have room to improve this dividend much further over time.
Chris Hill: I think you used the word admire with respect to Lennar. We talked previously about KB Home, D.R. Horton is a major homebuilder. What is it about Lennar and the way they run their business that makes you like them more so than the others?
John Rotonti: If I had to put one thing on Lennar that I like more than the others, they have a division which is called LEN X or Lennar X, which is basically a venture capital division, where they invest in different home related technologies, one of which is Opendoor, the leading iBuying company in the world, now that Zillow has closed its iBuying business. We're left with Opendoor and Redfin, and they own a minority stake, but a substantial stake in Opendoor and then a variety of other venture-like investments as well. I like the industry as a whole because they are moving from a asset-heavy land-heavy business model, where they would own and develop land which required a lot of debt to one that is much more land light, so they're owning and developing less land and focusing more on returns on invested capital and returns on equity. We saw that in KB's guidance, where they're increasing their return on equity from 2021 levels by 600 basis points.
Chris Hill: Before we move on to semiconductors, I need you to cure me of something, and you referenced Zillow. When I hear the phrase iBuying, unfortunately I think of Zillow and the debacle of Zillow attempting to roll out their iBuying program and then cutting it back and then suspending it. It was breath taking the speed with which they launched and shutdown their iBuying program. I feel like iBuying is one of those things. My default thoughts should not be Zillow and its debacle with iBuyer. How should investors think about iBuying either on the consumer side or just as something to watch within this industry?
John Rotonti: I don't know, I was bullish on the potential for iBuying to really transform the home buying and selling experience from a consumer standpoint until the Zillow debacle. Now, I'm much less bullish on iBuying. One thing I'll say about Opendoor is they are a pure-play iBuying company. Zillow started as something else. Zillow started as a basically advertising-driven search engine for homes. Then they try to shift into iBuying. Maybe Opendoor will have a better go at it because that's all they do. Maybe they're just better at it. Maybe they are better managed when it comes to that, better organized when it comes to that. The thing I like about Lennar and owning a stake in which I don't have a stake in Lennar, personally. But the thing I like about investing through Lennar is you get some exposure to iBuying through their investment in Opendoor. But you're paying, once again, like a PE of seven or eight or something like that.
Chris Hill: Taiwan Semiconductor posted record profits in the 4th quarter. They also offered upbeat guidance and said they plan to spend up to $44 billion this year to increase their manufacturing capacity. For those unfamiliar with Taiwan Semiconductor, they're the supplier for Apple, Qualcomm, and others of that size and ilk, shares up more than 5% this morning. Is it the record profits, the guidance, the commitment to investing the money or is it some combination of all three that's pushing this stock higher?
John Rotonti: It's all three. Taiwan Semiconductor, and I don't like to speak in superlatives, is probably the most important company on planet earth.
Chris Hill: Wow, really?
John Rotonti: Yeah. Every electronic device in the world has something from Taiwan Semiconductor in it. They manufacture over 50% of all the world's contracted semiconductors, but they manufacturer 90% of the most advanced technological chips, 90%. So they're a really, really important company, especially as we get more and more digital and electronics start pushing into more and more of our daily lives. The other thing I'll say is $44 billion in CapEx is probably, I'd have to check this, the most capital-intensive business on Earth. I'm not aware of another company spending $44 billion in property plant equipment in one year. There may be a few, but I can count on my hand. So there's not a lot. What that signifies, Chris, what that signals, $44 billion in CapEx, that's the demand that they see for their products. They need to build this capacity in order to satisfy demand. Along with that increase in CapEx guidance for 2022, they also increase their long-term revenue guidance from 10-15% up to 15-20%. That's a substantial jump. You see how important a company is when they need to invest $40 plus billion a year in capital to satisfy demand. This is a demand story. It's incredible. The world is short semiconductors and Taiwan Semiconductor is trying to take share and fill that demand.
Chris Hill: This seems like one of those bits of data that whether you're bullish or bearish on semiconductors in the global supply chain, you've got something to work with here because on the bullish side, you look at them raising guidance. You speak of the demand. On the bearish side, they're investing this money, it's not going to increase capacity in the next 12 months. This is a long play and I think that for a company of this size, you want to see this type of investment. But this isn't going to dramatically move the needle on semiconductor production in 2022, is it?
John Rotonti: No. You're exactly right. Some of this CapEx is going to go toward building next-gen chips, which they aren't even selling yet. So these three nanometer and these two nanometer chips, right now the size of the chips they're selling are in the seven nanometer and five nanometer space. So a lot of this, like you said, far out, it takes over a year and between $10 and $20 billion to build one of these fabrication facilities. It's extremely capital-intensive. Currently, Taiwan Semiconductor only has one competitor for the world's most leading edge chips and that's Samsung. They will soon have Intel as well. Intel says they are going to get into the space. But right now it's a duopoly and Taiwan Semiconductor is far and away the leader. They have 90% market share of the world's most advanced chips.
Chris Hill: Last thing and then I'll let you go. Taiwan Semiconductor, I feel like they are akin to NVIDIA in the sense that both companies are worth more than $600 billion each. But they're not nearly as well known to consumers and even investors as other companies of that size. When you think about consumer names like Facebook, I'm sorry, Meta Platforms, that we're supposed to call it now. But these are enormous companies. From a stock perspective, it's had a tremendous run. Do you look at Taiwan Semiconductor as a stock people should look at right now or is this one of those times where, it's like, I don't want to say you have to have a strong stomach, but it's a little frothy right now maybe?
John Rotonti: No, sure. If you have a long enough time horizon, which I'll define as at least five-years. You're willing to hold the stock for five years, Yes. I think now is a good time to look at Taiwan Semiconductor. Thirty seconds, I'll just say you mentioned NVIDIA. Taiwan Semiconductor is a platform that they allow their customers to acquire much more value than Taiwan Semiconductor keeps for itself. For example, Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA has a quote and it's, ""There's basically air and Taiwan Semiconductor."" That's how important NVIDIA sees Taiwan Semiconductor to its own business. It was a platform before Amazon Web Services was a platform.
Chris Hill: This is why I love talking to John Rotonti. Thanks for being here.
John Rotonti: Thank you, Chris. I hope I can come back soon.
Chris Hill: After an historic year for real estate investing, what can investors expect in 2022? Among other things, a sea change in commercial real estate. Deidre Woollard has more.
Deidre Woollard: Thanks Chris. I'm Deidre Woollard, and I'm here with Lead Real Estate Analyst, Matt Argersinger. Matt 2021 was a pretty strong year for real estate in the stock market.
Matt Argersinger: It certainly was Deidre, If you look at the Vanguard Real Estate ETF, which is a benchmark that we follow when we're looking at real estate investments, it was up over 40%, it was its best year ever, and that index has been around for about 16 years. If you look at the National Association of REITs, which is another index, it had its second best year on record of 41%, extraordinary year for real estate, and REITs in 2021. REITs have a great track record for those listening who might not be familiar with REITs, real estate investment trust. If you factor in 2021, they've returned on average 13.5% per year since 1972, so almost 50 years worth of data that outperforms S&P 500. It was a great year for real estate in 2021, but really, real estate investing has been doing well for investors for decades.
Deidre Woollard: REITs were bouncing back from a pretty hard 2020, and some of the impact of COVID-19.
Matt Argersinger: Yeah. Fair to point that out, I think 2020 was a difficult year for real estate. It was one of those sectors that was more acutely affected than other industries. Just because, if you think about retail real estate, hotels, hospitality, office, is one that's still suffering from the effects of the pandemic. 2020 was a very, very difficult year, REITs were down in the high single digits on average that year. I expected, I think as you did, that 2021 was going to be better, and it certainly was. I don't think we thought it was going to be this good or historically good as it was though.
Deidre Woollard: Exactly, well, let's talk about some of those trends that were most interested in. The first one, I feel like is one that's both pandemic-driven, but also was already in process for years before that, and that's Sun Belt migration. People moving to Texas, Florida. Redfin came out with their hottest neighborhoods recently, I think most of them were in Florida. Lot of really interesting activity happening in the Sun Belt right now.
Matt Argersinger: Yeah, that's right. I mean, as you said, this was happening before the pandemic. We saw all trends population. If you look at U-Haul data, which is a cool dataset that you and I look at now and then it was all heading down toward the Sun Belt markets to Southeast to Southwest, away from the coast, and what the pandemic did is, it really just accelerated that trend. Suddenly you had a lot of workers who are used to living in the big coastal gateway markets. Your San Franciscos, Los Angeles's, your New Yorks, your Bostons, and all of a sudden, they had a lot more flexibility with their job, and they can work remotely wherever they thought would be best for them, and that meant looking for, in lot of cases, cheaper places in the South-Southwest or in the inner parts of the country, or just places that they have a better life, they prefer to live and still be a productive employee.
Those trends really, really took off with the pandemic, they've not ceased, and we'll continue to see this big swell, population rolled down to those other markets, and what you're also seeing in a lot of those places is there's just not enough houses. There are not enough houses at all in the country to meet the demand out there. But especially in those markets as hot demand markets, you mentioned Florida and Texas. If you look at places like Austin, Texas, Houston Dallas, Fort Worth, or if you go to Florida, and you look at Miami or Tampa, there's just so much demand for housing, there's not a lot of it. There's demand for apartments, you're seeing home prices go up, you're seeing apartment rent surge, and unfortunately developments just not going to be able to meet that demand. You're going to see, I think, again, rising home prices, rising rents, especially in those markets.
Deidre Woollard: Cheaper rents, hopefully bigger apartments, warm weather, if investors were looking to bet on some of those trends, what's one idea they could take a look at?
Matt Argersinger: I think one idea that comes to mind is Mid-America Apartment Communities, tickers, MAA, it's the biggest owner operator of apartments in the country actually. But they have so much exposure, about 90% of their assets are in the ""Sun Belt region"", and that's where they've been focused for for decades now. As the largest apartment owner and operator in those markets, I think they've been a huge beneficiary of this demand, their occupancy rates are at record, rents, in a lot of their markets are up double-digits, if not even 20% more in a lot of places, and I think that's going to continue. Mid-America Apartment Communities, it's had a nice run as a stock, but I could see more upside as this trend plays out.
Deidre Woollard: Now, our last trend, I feel like it's pretty much COVID-driven, and that's the impact of remote work on the office real estate sector. A lot of companies we're planning to have people come back in January that's been pushed back. Some companies have just given up on announcing deadlines of return at all, and yet at the same time, I've seen a flurry of big office leases from companies like Meta, Roku, in markets like New York, and Los Angeles. What's going on here?
Matt Argersinger: It is the most confusing part of the real estate market, for a lot of reasons, as you pointed out Deidre. I mean, we know what the pandemic has done with the work from home, and hybrid work schedules, and what that means for office occupancy, which is so low right now. Yet a lot of these technology companies out there, and life science companies out there are leasing office space at record paces, and to me that's not surprising. But I think if we step back, and look at the office market, I really do think if we past peak office, so to speak. No matter where you look, what surveys you read or what economists you read, the prevailing thought is that companies are going to lease less office space today, and in the future than they did prior to the pandemic.
It's a real major sea change for the industry. I don't think we understand the full implications of this, but the real short-term implication is that we have too much office square footage in this country, a lot of it needs to be transitioned to probably apartments, as you're seeing in certain cities, or maybe even to hospitality, or maybe that office just gets converted to co-working spaces. It's not necessarily a dedicated corporate office or corporate headquarters anymore, it's a place where employees come to collaborate on an offer team basis, and so that's the state of office right now. Now, there are parts of the office market that I think can do well. Technology, R&D, life science, medical offices. We're actually in a position after pandemic to actually need more of that kind of office. There are parts of the office market that I think are going to work. Again, co-working is probably going to do well, medical office flex spaces. But the traditional office building, I think, is going to probably become a thing of the past, believe it or not.
Deidre Woollard: Well, you can't do your medical research at home, and that's one of the reasons that you, and I are both excited about life sciences, and the growth in that sector. I know that you, and I both have a favorite in this category, let's talk about it.
Matt Argersinger: Sure, my favorite has always been for a long time, and that's Alexandria Real Estate Equities, ticker ARE, it's the leading real estate REIT for life sciences, and technology, They really cater to, if you think about companies like Moderna or Pfizer who led the vaccine front, or companies like Facebook, that are doing all innovations, Meta, I keep calling it Facebook, Google, these are the companies that really lease from Alexandria Real Estate, and we see that demand has not fallen off. Alexandria Real Estate occupancy has never been higher, it's had no problem collecting rents throughout the entire crisis, which is such a departure from other office REITs which did suffer. I love it, it's got a founder-led management team, or even outperforming the market for decades now at this point, and even though the stock has had a really nice run, and it's a little bit expensive, maybe from just some valuation points of view, but it's one that I like very much, and it's really taking advantage of this trend toward life science office.
Deidre Woollard: Absolutely. They had recent big deal with Moderna in Cambridge Massachusetts, they're really focused in all of the markets where life science is booming.
Matt Argersinger: That's right. You mentioned Moderna, I think it's a 500,000 square foot new headquarters of building in Cambridge, and it's going to be owned, and operated by Alexandria Real Estate.
Deidre Woollard: Love it. Well, always a pleasure to talk real estate with you. Thanks, Matt.
Matt Argersinger: Thanks, Deidre.

I have been a big Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) bull for a long time now. All you have to do is look at a chart of NVDA stock over the past five years to see why. The company continues to dominate competitors and there is seemingly nothing to slow it down.

When NVDA stock dipped during the Covid-19 selloff and everyone was seemingly losing their collective minds, I called Nvidia “a steal” below $50 (on a split-adjusted basis). For what it’s worth, I don’t say that to gloat. 
Trust me, that’s not my thing. I have been humbled far too many times that arrogance is now a superstition of mine. In any regard, I really bring that call up because, when things feel panicky, that’s when investors need to dial in and focus. Don’t get lost in the chaos. As a mentor of mine once said, when the market speeds up, slow down.
Currently down 35% from its all-time high, I think it’s safe to say things have officially sped up for NVDA stock. 
When to Buy the Dip in NVDA Stock
Nvidia is a former relative strength monster, but when shares were up more than 160% on the year at the highs, it was clear that it would have to cool off at some point. That point is now. Shares are down four weeks in a row and in eight of the last nine weeks. 
7 Dividend Stocks to Profit off the Hot Real Estate Market
On Jan. 21, NVDA stock filled the gap from Oct. 26. With a bit more downside, though, we’ll start to hit some more meaningful levels. Specifically, that’s the weekly VWAP measure, then the 200-day and 50-week moving averages.
If NVDA stock hits the 200-day, it will be down about 37% from the highs. If it hits the 50-week near its present value, shares will be down roughly 40% from the high.

If you love Nvidia and want some exposure, there are worse times to buy then after a 35% dip down toward the 200-day. However, if we get to the $195 to $200 area, I think that’s an area investors really need to consider adding some exposure. 
Not only is the 50-week a notable breakout area on the chart (blue line), but it’s also near the fourth-quarter low. 
While the markets could tumble into a bear market and NVDA stock lose 50% or more of its value, investors can bet on the long-term here. In the long run, this name will come back. It’s a matter of when, not if. 
Going below $195 and failing to get back above that does open Nvidia up to more potential downside. But we can revisit NVDA stock if that becomes the situation.
Why to Buy the Dip in Nvidia
Okay, so we know where to buy the dip, but why do we want to do that? Frankly, because Nvidia is one of the best companies I have ever seen. I like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and respect Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) — although I’m not attracted to the latter — but Nvidia dominates both.
AMD has robust growth and, like Nvidia, has continued to stun analysts, leaving them far too conservative and caught flat-footed. But Nvidia’s margin profile versus AMD shows which company really has the pricing power. Analysts (finally) expect approximately 60% revenue growth this year for Nvidia, with estimates calling for $26.7 billion in sales.

Allow me to show you something. The chart to the side shows how much consensus revenue estimates have come up over the last 12 months. Will they be short again this year?
Estimates for calendar 2022 (fiscal 2023) call for 19% growth. While that seems like a big deceleration from the prior year, it’s still pretty darn impressive. Further, estimates for fiscal-year 2024 and 2025 also call for 16% and 19% revenue growth, respectively. 
It might be a little too aggressive, but can we make a bull case and say 20% annual revenue growth for the next three years? 
Given Nvidia’s end-markets — autonomous driving (AD), artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, graphics, supercomputing, cloud-computing, datacenters, metaverse and more — that’s not so far-fetched in my view. And if that’s the case, it answers the why part of why investors should be long NVDA stock.
One Risk to Create More Chaos
All that said, the one risk that really jumps out to me here is Nvidia’s planned acquisition of Arm. The $40 billion deal is nothing to sneeze at. While it will cost a pretty penny for Nvidia, it will significantly bolster its list of customers and give it an impressive portfolio. 
There’s incredible value there. However, if the deal falls through, I don’t know what will happen to NVDA stock. 
If the market remains in a sell-the-news mood, a failed deal might smack the share price lower. Will it be down 40% at that point? Or even 50%, maybe? For all we know, NVDA will rally back to $300-plus and pop on the news. Who really knows? 
I only mention this because headlines amid chaos can create sell-the-news reactions. I don’t think this is any different.

2022-01-26 00:00:00+00:00,US STOCKS-Wall St eyes strong open on Microsoft's outlook; Fed decision looms,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-st-eyes-strong-open-on-microsofts-outlook-fed-decision-looms,"By Devik Jain and Bansari Mayur Kamdar
Jan 26 (Reuters) - Stellar outlook from Microsoft put U.S. stock indexes on course for a stronger open on Wednesday after two sessions of turbulent trading and ahead of the outcome of a Federal Reserve policy meeting.
Microsoft Corp MSFT.O gained 5.3% before the bell after estimating current-quarter revenue broadly ahead of market estimates, driven in part by its cloud business. Chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc TXN.O rose 4.6% as it also gave a strong outlook.
The positive forecasts lifted tech-related stocks, with Meta Platforms FB.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Google-owner Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O, Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O rising between 2.1% and 4.4%.
The rate-sensitive tech and growth stocks have recently been roiled by fears of aggressive Fed action to combat inflation. Rising geopolitical tensions around Russia and Ukraine have also weighed on the market, with the S&P 500 index .SPX flirting with a correction twice this week.
The Fed policy decision is due at 2 p.m. ET (1900 GMT), with the U.S. central bank expected to signal the start of an interest rate hike cycle beginning March.
The announcement will be followed by Fed chairman Jerome Powell's news conference, which will be parsed for clues on the magnitude and pace of hikes for the year and strategy for shrinking the central bank's roughly $9 trillion balance sheet.
Fed funds futures traders are pricing in a 25 basis point hike in March, in addition to three more rate increases by the end of the year.
""If between the notes and Chairman Powell's press conference today, we get some clarity around that path of interest rate hikes that could certainly settle down the market and decrease the volatility we're seeing,"" said Mike Skillman, chief executive officer at Faith Investor Services in Dallas.
""When rates rise valuation becomes more important so earnings become more important to save the day. From a market perspective, earnings going forward are going to be better.""
The fourth-quarter reporting season is in full stride. As of Tuesday, analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to grow 24.1% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv.
At 8:32 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 394 points, or 1.15%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 68.25 points, or 1.57%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 326.25 points, or 2.31%.
The S&P 500 index is now down nearly 9.2% from its record closing peak on Jan. 3, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC has fallen 13.5% so far this year.
Planemaker Boeing Co BA.N gained 2.2% after saying it generated positive cash flow in the fourth-quarter, its first positive cash quarter since early 2019.
Tesla Inc TSLA.O added 4.2% ahead of its quarterly results after market close, while AT&T Inc T.N rose 2.2% after it beat market estimates for quarterly revenue on strong wireless and streaming demand.
Barbie maker Mattel MAT.O jumped 7.6% on winning back rights to make toys based on Disney Princesses from Hasbro Inc HAS.O.

Chris Hill: Earnings season kicks off. We've got a few companies we're looking forward to hearing from and our guest has a couple of stocks he thinks are looking good at their current price. If you are a long-term investor, you're in the right place. We've got all that and more coming up right now.
I'm Chris Hill, joined by senior analysts, Jason Moser and Maria Gallagher. Good to see both!
Maria Gallagher: Good to see you, too!
Chris Hill: We've got the latest headlines from Wall Street Financial Planner, Malcolm Ethridge is our guest this week. As always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar. But we begin with the start of earnings season three of Wall Street's biggest banks sharing fourth-quarter reports on Friday morning. Wells Fargo's (NYSE: WFC) profits in revenue came in much higher-than-expected. But Citigroup (NYSE: C) saw a rise in expenses cutting into their profits. JPMorgan Chase's results were overshadowed by lowered guidance for 2022. Jason, what's your headline for each one?
Jason Moser: Well, we talked about 2022 being a better year for the banks. I think it will be to an extent, but it's not like 2021 was a bad year. If you look at the numbers, JPMorgan's total return was just under 28 percent. Wells Fargo just right at 61 percent, both outpacing the market. What the bad year, I'm sure some of that has to do with the anticipatory market pulling forward some of those expectations for eventual higher interest rates. But this was, I think, a quarter that really help them set the table for 2022. Let's start. What's going to order of tangible book value from highest to lowest Chris because I think that really follows the market sentiment here overall. With JPMorgan, I think at a time when it was very fair to question whether they would be raising guidance as interest rates start to tick up, it's fascinating to me, they're actually lowering guidance. That is due in large part to inflationary pressures, higher costs, a tight labor market.
With that said, the business continues to perform very well. They beat on both counts for the quarter, consumers have been flushed. The consumer banking average deposits were up 20 percent for the quarter and loans down just a tick. Profitability continues to drag their due to low rates. Wealth management assets under management at $3.1 trillion, that was up 15 percent, thanks to market conditions and inflows. Generally speaking, good things for JPMorgan. Wells Fargo. I think honestly, this is a good story that just keeps getting better, and hats off to Matt Frankel, my colleague, their Industry Focus. We talked about this all last year. That was his bank stock for the year and really for his many problems as they were having, particularly with the culture, but really that bled into the business itself. Another quarter or Wells beat on both counts. They released another $875 million in reserves for those allowances for credit losses.
I think a very similar story to JPMorgan in a lot of ways. Home lending for Wells was down eight percent primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, which was driven by lower originations. Then you go to Citi. In Citi, there's just not a lot to really smile about right now. The headline here is ""Hit Refresh"" because that's really what they're doing. This is a bank in the middle. I don't want to call it a turnaround necessarily, but it is a refresh. They find themselves in a little bit of a different bode here. They continue to divest some laggards of the business, the big divestiture of their consumer banking business in Asia. That veiled what was modest earnings growth for the quarter. But I think when you look at the way the market is viewing these stocks today, with JPMorgan valued at 2.2 times tangible book, Wells Fargo valued well under two times tangible book, and then Citi valued well below tangible book. I think that really tells you what the market's thinking and what the market is expecting this coming year.
Chris Hill: For investors like me who don't own shares of any of the big banks, did you hear anything today that provides clues to the broader economy?
Jason Moser: Yeah. I think generally the message was positive. JPMorgan noted in the release and I quote, "" The economy continues to do quite well despite headwinds related to the Omicron variant, inflation and supply chain bottlenecks. Generally speaking, the consumers are at a pretty good place. But I think the caveat there, inflation is real. It's something these banks are dealing with. Costs are going up across the board. Consumers will not be immune to that, so it will be something to pay attention to this coming year.
Chris Hill: Let's move on to the deal of the week which arrived on Monday. Take-Two Interactive announced its buying Zynga in a cash and stock deal worth 12.7 billion. Take-Two gets a much bigger presence in mobile gaming and Zynga shareholders get a pretty nice premium for their shares, Maria.
Maria Gallagher: It's a really interesting deal. I think it's very logical, but I think it's important to look at the history of Zynga for a second. It was founded 15 years ago as a poker game for Facebook. Prior to its 2011 IPO, it was a huge deal. FarmVille was massive. I was working with Facebook, so it was really a darling when it IPO-ed. The stock debuted at $10. It was up to $14 a couple of times in 2012. But their growth really relied entirely on Facebook. Then Facebook limited their third-party developers from promoting their services that cut their revenue in half. Their stock was down 75 percent. It still to this day has never recovered. Even with that premium that Take-Two is paying, it's still below their IPO price.
That's really interesting to me if you look at the whole history of Zynga, who is known for games like FarmVille, Words With Friends, Harry Potter games, Star Wars games. I understand the rationale, it's really establishing leadership in this mobile area, which is the fastest-growing segment of the entertainment industry. It brings together your console and PC franchises. I think it's a really high price point. It's pretty high premium. But I think it'll be interesting to see how they integrate and then what they can ultimately grow into to get that consistent customer and consumer appetite for those games in those brands.
Chris Hill: Is that why you think shares of Take-Two took a little bit of a hit this week that some people think they're paying too much for Zynga?
Maria Gallagher: I think, yeah. I think a lot of times you see what these mobile games it's really the fad of the time. There was a time everyone was playing the Kim Kardashian game. There at the time everyone's playing FarmVille. It's about getting a company that can consistently keep those consumers interested. I think that maybe people aren't sure that Zynga can do that, and they're trying to see some clarity behind that.
Chris Hill: Rough week for Elastic shareholders, the search software company announced the co-founder and CEO, Shay Banon is stepping down to assume the role of Chief Technology Officer. Shares of Elastic, down 12 percent this week and hitting a 52-week low, Jason.
Jason Moser: It's always fascinating to me to see the market react so quickly to news like this. From a longer-term perspective, it actually seems like it could be good news. Ash Kulkarni moving into the CEO role. Shay Banon and co-founder and former CEO, he will move over to the CTO role and also remain on the Board. If you have a CEO and he doesn't really want to be CEO, Chris, do you want to be CEO? Because I don't. I want to get people where they want to be. I want to get the right people in the right places. Then it feels like that what this ultimately accomplishes. The tech is where Banon's passion is. This happens often. For a company to get to that next level, oftentimes, they need to make a pivot toward an operator to be able to do that. I would be cautiously optimistic with this, particularly when you look at the business itself that continues to do well.
Most recent quarter they announced total subscriptions of over 17,000. That was up from 12,900 a year ago. Large customers with an average contract or an annual contract value greater than $100,000, grew to 830 versus 650 a year ago. Then buried in that press release at the very bottom, I wonder how many people caught it, but management also announced that it now expects to exceed its guidance for revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP net loss per share provided for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. It looks like we've got some good results coming here shortly as well. All-in-all, I think this is a good business where the market's knee-jerk reaction could be opening up an opportunity for patient investors.
Chris Hill: Earnings season just getting started on Friday and with so many companies reporting in the coming weeks. Maria, before we go to break, what is a company that you are especially curious to hear from?
Maria Gallagher: A company I'm excited to hear about and hear from his Pinterest. What we saw from them last quarter was a slowdown in growth for some users, a decline in monthly active users in certain demographics. That wasn't surprising to me as life was more in-person, more active, traditionally, summer and fall aren't their strongest quarters anyway. But I think it's important to see that these companies that had a lot of pull-through and new customers during 2020 to see if there are monetizing those customers well to see if those customers are staying. Especially around the holidays with Pinterest specifically trying to get more shoppable to see if they saw an increase in that monetization effort and saw more engagement and users over this holiday season as they are trying to pivot to more of a shoppable app. I think that Pinterest specifically, but those types of social media in general, is something that I'm really excited to dig into a little bit more.
Chris Hill: Jason, I would put Amazon on this list just because of how big the company is. Obviously, there are a lot of companies we want to hear from in the retail space about how the holidays went for them. But when you throw in AWS, all the different things Amazon has going on, I'd put it on the list as well. What about you?
Jason Moser: Yeah, I like both of those and I'll add Etsy to the mixture as well it's stock has essentially been cut in half from its 52-week high, but the company to generate $600 million in free cash flow over the last 12 months, I put shares now around 35 times trailing free cash flow. Boy added, Chris, it's getting interesting, I think with that. It's the stock I own, you know I like it. But we saw the report here in regard to retail sales in December. It looks like those numbers, obviously you exclude autos, those sales fell 2.3 percent. Online spending took the biggest hit of that actually, and that's add it's bread and butter. But I look back to last quarter, some initiatives they've been putting into motion here particularly for the holiday season. They were focusing on fulfillment, being more communicative in regard to the arrival of those shipments. They have a store seller program that's really helping merchants up their game in rise to that next level for their customers. Then also the new gift finder feature. Listen, I sifted through that during the holiday. Chris, it was pretty clever, is very intuitive, and very helpful. All things considered, it really feels like this pullback in Etsy shares given the initiatives they've been focusing on, I'm very interested to hear how the holiday season went and how 2022 is shaping up.
Chris Hill: After the break, we've got the latest news from restaurants, relationships, and the business of outer space. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here, with Maria Gallagher and Jason Moser. Shares of Virgin Galactic down more than 20 percent this week. The space tourism company announced plans to raise up to $500 million in debt. Maria, when they went public in October 2019, they said they'd be flying customers in 2020. Now, Virgin Galactic is saying, ""It's really going to be the end of 2022.""
Maria Gallagher: Yeah, they've had multiple delays in their spacecraft testing and development. They've pushed back its commercial services to later this year, at the earliest. But they have sold seats ahead of the plant pace. Their ticket sales are at an updated price of $450,000 a seat, which is very reasonable, according to them. They were targeting 1,000 reservations; they've sold 700 out of 1,000. So they still have that customer appetite, but they just need more money. They need to fund it, they need to get ready. So I'm not surprised with that pushback, that they need more time before they can see consistent revenue generation. I'm curious to see what they end up using the money on, and also just, if the commercial flights start taking place as planned.
Chris Hill: We're not going to be surprised if they push it to 2023, are we?
Maria Gallagher: I wouldn't be, no.
Chris Hill: From space travel to the business of relationships; shares of Match Group down a bit this week, despite getting an upgrade from analysts at Goldman Sachs. But at least Match Group has one less competitor to worry about; Meta Platforms, the company formerly known as Facebook is shutting down Sparked, the video dating service the company apparently started last year. Jason, I got to be honest, I really forgot that Sparked was a thing that Facebook was trying.
Jason Moser: The tone of your voice, I find that hard to believe, Chris. Nevertheless, I'm with you; you could be forgiven if you didn't realize this actually existed. But I'm going to harken back to May 4th, 2018, Chris, where I tweeted in regard to this very specific issue. I said on that date, ""I'm not a March owner, but I have a hard time seeing Facebook impacting their business much at all on the long run. Zuck's got a long history of trying stuff like this to no avail, and he is very late to the game where online match making is concerned."" Fast-forward to today's news, you can understand, I too am not surprised.
Chris Hill: I will give Meta Platforms some credit because, apparently, when they were emailing people to tell them about this, and I'm quoting directly from the email, they wrote, ""Like many good ideas, some takeoff, and others, like Sparked, must come to an end."" That's a pretty harsh take on something you tried to launch, but I give them credit for it.
Jason Moser: Yeah.
Chris Hill: Earlier this week, Domino's Pizza was one of the companies presenting at the ICR Investment Conference. CEO, Richard Allison, said the company is making changes to its value offerings to deal with rising costs. Among the changes, Maria, moving some items to digital-only orders, and fewer chicken wings in orders. I feel like that second one is going to get more blowback from customers. But interesting to see a leader in the restaurant space being pretty direct about how they're planning to deal with inflation and rising costs.
Maria Gallagher: Right. So what they're saying is they're cutting the number of chicken wings in the offer from 10-8. Their $7.99 Carryout Deal is now, like you said, online only. So this new offer is a three-topping pizza, or wings, for $7.99. But what's really interesting about this is what we're seeing is something called shadow inflation, which is when the price of a good or a service stays the same, but the quality has gone down. We see this a lot in hotels and restaurants. Hotels, for example, it might cost the same, but you don't get the daily room service, or you don't get the buffet breakfast in the morning. Cleanliness is a huge one. Consumer sentiment on restaurant cleanliness fell 4 percent this year. So what we're seeing is this is a little bit harder to track. But you see, when you have inflation, you have all these different types that it impacts consumers in lots of different ways, but this is one that people are talking about and people are noticing as they're paying the same, but the quality of the services significantly decreased, or the amount of goods they're getting has decreased. So I'll be interested to see how other restaurants follow this news with their own.
Chris Hill: Although, when you think about the investments that Domino's has made in digital, and Allison being very clear about the fact that look, ""We're taking orders over the phone; that's more expensive for our business than when we're taking digital orders."" This could be a hidden win in some ways in the long run for Domino's. I wouldn't be surprised to see other restaurant chains doing the same thing because, ultimately, don't they want more people using their mobile app?
Maria Gallagher: Yeah, and online orders typically come with those higher average tickets than orders placed over the phone. So it's usually a better system for Domino's and for the restaurants. I think it will be interesting to see. Domino's has that technology infrastructure, they have those capabilities already built out, so I'd want to understand how that's going to impact some of those smaller restaurants that don't have those capabilities in the same way, and don't have the scale Domino's does to be able to pivot into this more profitable channel during inflationary times.
Chris Hill: Well, most restaurant chains could do far worse than just to follow Domino's blueprint with what they've done with mobile ordering. A quick thanks to a longtime listener, Aaron, in Virginia, who wanted us to weigh in on a new product offering from Crocs that's going to be available in March. Crocs has apparently teamed up with luxury fashion house, Balenciaga, I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly, to produce Stiletto heeled Crocs for just $625. Jason, let me say that again, $625 for 3-inch heel Crocs. What do you think?
Jason Moser: That's a lot of cabbage, Chris. We can make fun of this all we want. Long-time shareholders can tell us to stick it because Crocs just wins, baby. I mean, the stocks up better than 1600 percent over the last five years alone. These things may seem silly to us on the surface; they also do keep Crocs in the conversations. So I like the ideas. I like how they form partnerships. They came out with a KFC shoe at some point. But you know want to I want to see, Chris; right is this weather starts to warm up, I want to see some grill collaboration this year. Partner up with Weber, partner up with Traeger. What about big green egg Crocs, that are not only green, but shaped like eggs. The ideas are just out there, Chris. I'm presenting them for further deliberation. Just throwing it out there.
Chris Hill: Maria, you're in New York City, will you let us know if you spot anyone on the street wearing these?
Maria Gallagher: I will let you know. I recently saw people with the ugliest shoes I've ever seen in my life. Then I look them up, and they were $500 Yeezys. So clearly, I don't know what fashion is at this point.
Chris Hill: We'll see you later in the show. Up next, financial planner, Malcolm Ethridge, will analyze what the Fed Chief said on Capitol Hill this week, and what it means for investors. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money, I'm Chris Hill. Earlier this week Jay Powell testified before Congress, to help make sense of the Fed Chair. What he said is Malcolm Ethridge is a certified financial planner and an executive with CIC Wealth, and he joins me now from where else? His home. Good to see you, thanks for being here.
Malcolm Ethridge: It's good to be anywhere I can be virtually, I guess at this point like you said.
Chris Hill: There are a couple of things I want to get too, but let's start with Jay Powell. He testified before the Senate Banking Committee at his confirmation hearing. Look I know he's a smart qualified guy and I know it's an important job, but I just did not care enough to watch. Did he say anything that caught your attention, anything that you think matters to investors?
Malcolm Ethridge: I think the commentary about Jay Powell was more entertaining than the commentary from Jay Powell. Someone referred to him as Goldilocks in a suit. Which I thought was the most hilarious way to put it, and it was very apt too it was perfect. He made the case that inflation and its impact on us is going to be longer through the year, then he thinks people are thinking I guess is the way to say it. He made that very clear and he made the case that inflation at top 7 percent at the end of 2021. He sees that number as sticking around for longer than people probably realize. That was probably the most impactful thing of all of it. Because if that's what the Fed is predicting, than that means that that's what you, and I, and the folks who rely on us for information about the markets need to wrap their minds around.
For context, last year we got the cost of living adjustment out of the Fed related to social security benefits and it was a 5.9 percent. We will like, "" That's a whopping 5.9 percent cost of living adjustments. That's a pretty big deal. They must be being overly generous."" Which we now have found out no, they actually were somewhat on target. They undershot it by a little bit, but they were expecting this thing to be pretty significant, this thing being inflation. To be pretty significant and also to hang around for long enough, to give a full year's worth of additional benefit to people on a fixed income, Retirees on a fixed income. For context the year before I think it was 2.7, and the year before that it was like 2.3 was the cost of living adjustments incrementally. We're talking more than double for 2022 is what they gave as the adjustments. All that to say the government is taking inflation seriously, we as consumers need to also take inflation seriously.
Chris Hill: I know we're only two weeks into the new year, but 2022 is not off to a good start for the market in general, particularly the Nasdaq. I'm sure I'm not the only one looking at some of the Nasdaq stocks that I own that are down to 40 percent or more. What questions are you getting from your clients and what are you telling them?
Malcolm Ethridge: The two main questions I'm getting are, do I need to hurry up and do this refinance that you were telling me about for the last three years that have been putting off? Even though in a lot of cases I answer yes, they'll probably still continue to put it off. Because just inertia in human nature and we tend to wait for whatever reason. Then the other question is, why do I keep hearing so much about interest rates and why should care? The answer in short for anyone who, this is your first time taking this class. It's OK to invest in things like tech stocks that are going to take years upon years to actually show their real value, or it's actually create real value. When interest rates are super low and companies can borrow toward that growth for very cheap.
But in years when interest rates are a little bit higher into borrow as a corporation, it takes a little bit more money it's less cheap to borrow. Now, I need you to show growth sooner than you were anticipating, so that I can actually have some return for these dollars that I'm handing you. That's one way to look at it the other is as far as bonds are concerned. A lot of professional traders who trade corporate bonds are looking at the spreads on the yields from those bonds. They're saying if I can find an opportunity to earn about as much in the bond market as I can in the stock market for presumably less risk. Why wouldn't I not just buy those bonds? As the spreads become more attractive in corporate bonds, less reason to buy into the stock market chasing growth. You have people selling all stocks, buying bonds, and those two things happening at the same time create this perfect storm of January that you're referring to.
Chris Hill: I'm assuming that for someone with your job, 2021 was a year in which among other things, you've got a lot of questions from people about newly public companies. When do you think about the number of IPOs, the number of specs. Do you think particularly with respect to the specs on the way a lot of them played out and tepid start to the year. Is that going to come down in 2022, or are we going to see fewer public companies or companies coming public, particularly via SPAC?
Malcolm Ethridge: I think a good indication of that is going to be the number of companies who were public, and we see them now going private in 2022. For one reason or another, they just can't quite get off the ground. Rent the Runway is one that I'm paying a lot of attention to. It's a company that I looked at in 2021 and said this company has no business trying to get public, because they just don't have the financials to support it. Rent the Runway turning into once again a private company will be a great leading indicator. Another one is WeWork. They're trying their hardest to get WeWork public while the opportunity still exists, because people are interested in buying into IPO is really big splashy names. If WeWork can't make it public by the end of 2022, that'll be again a really great indicator that the party has ended. The folks who are still looking at the SPAC market, is there a way to really allocate their dollars and the stock market. That's the way that I'm looking at those leading indicators. Companies that IPO to recently and they turn around and half to go private again.
Chris Hill: I suppose the silver lining to the extent that there is one, is that there are some good and in some cases maybe even great businesses that are now available at a lower stock price. What are the one or two stocks, or just categories of stocks that you think are looking more attractive right now?
Malcolm Ethridge: I really love PayPal. Obviously not a super splashy name than anybody's unaware of. But to answer your question directly, I really love PayPal at the price it's at today. It's gotten whack quite a bit because it really hasn't shown improvement anything. One of the reasons that it's been considered disappointing, is because they didn't really do a lot in the buy now pay later movement that we saw come along with their firms as an example. A lot of folks the sentiment was PayPal is allowing our firm to take market share that it should be having. But we're seeing already the government making noise and saying things about their interest in the buy now pay later market and them wanting to come in and regulated a little bit more. Which means that there's not a lot of opportunity left there for folks who are looking at that as the space they want to be investing in.
Which means that PayPal didn't really miss out on a ton, they just were now vindicated in avoiding that. In the meantime, they said that they anticipate generating about $5 billion in free cash in 2022. Which has got to go somewhere, because PayPal has a history of aggressively growing inorganically. They're taking those dollars they have sitting on the sidelines and they're going on buying great businesses rather than starting up new business units internally. Because they already have a history of doing that and very aggressively, I see them as being a great company that's poised to do more of that in 2022 especially in Asia. Because they've got a really strong foothold in Japan in 2021, they've announced that they identified two key targets in Indonesia in 2022 that they might be interested in. Which tells me they're going to continue to push into Greater Asia for inorganic growth, so that's the one I've really got my eye on.
Chris Hill: Before I let you get away, what else?
Malcolm Ethridge: I also really love real estate and healthcare. Although the two sectors specifically that we as a firm are focused on, I as an individual and focused on. I've got a ton of it in my own portfolio, a name I will give you that isn't necessarily an underperformer that's undervalued and has a really attractive entry point but I think they've done a lot of room to go is UnitedHealthcare. UNH is selling above $300 a share it's a pretty hefty., but we're looking at UNH as there'll be the biggest beneficiary of the pent-up demand for health services that for the last two years hasn't really been achieved. You've got how many elective surgeries that people have been sitting on waiting to get done. You've got a lot of just general maintenance type healthcare that should have been done in 21, should have been done in 20 even for some people. That they will now be going to visit their doctors in 22 as COVID starts to dissipate in the spring and summer, and look like it's finally going to leave us alone at least in a significant way. We anticipate a lot of people going to the doctors, UNH is one of the biggest beneficiaries of that just because of the market share that they have of the health insurance markets.
Chris Hill: One last thing in addition to your day job, because apparently here not busy enough. You will also host the Tech Money Podcast, season one wrapped up in mid-December. When can we expect Season two to start?
Malcolm Ethridge: Glad you asked it's January 19th, we're right around the corner from season two launching I'm really excited about it. Because of the feedback we got in season one and the way folks really loved episodes that we did around equity compensation. There'll be a ton more of that now going forward in season two. A lot of experts on the Equity Space that's becoming a way more attractive way to pay employees, especially younger employees and millennials and Gen Z years. Season two kicks off with quite a few interviews with founders and quite a few interviews with folks in Equity Comp Space. But I will say really quickly taking that break in December allowed me to checkout other podcasts that I'm interested in. I learn something interesting about you that I didn't know before, as long as I've known you which is that you are a fellow runner. I too am actually planning to do the Richmond Marathon this year in November. I didn't get to go last year because of COVID but I anticipate doing it this year in November.
Chris Hill: Maybe we can plan to meet up down in the capital city. You can find the Tech Money Podcast wherever you get your podcasts about leverage. Thanks so much for being here.
Malcolm Ethridge: Thanks for having me.
Chris Hill: Coming up after the break, Maria Gallagher and Jason Moser return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and on the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. Don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Welcome back to Motley Fool my name is Chris Hill here, once again with Jason Moser and Maria Gallagher. If you are just starting out investing or you know someone who's looking to get started investing, we have a free investing starter kit. It covers everything from how to set up a brokerage account to 401(k) planning to buying your first stock, and it includes 15 stocks and five ETFs that were selected by our investing team. It's free, just go to fool.com/starterkit.fool.com/starterkit, all one word, will put the URL in the show notes for this episode. Check it out.
We got an email from Tyler Cheney, he writes, ''I'm 34-years-old and I'm in a place in my career where I can invest more than I could previously. I have 47 stocks, and four ETFs that cover growth, value, dividends, tech, and the broad market. How many stocks should I have overall? I really enjoyed stock analysis as a hobby outside of work. But at this rate, I feel like I will have 100s over the next 20-30 years. Should I just amass a huge quantity and see how it goes or should I stick to a certain number or range?'' Jason, let me go to you first. We can't give specific advice, I'd like to question, I'd love to see that level of interest that you're growing in anyone out there. Great to see, so kudos to Tyler. But I understand his concern, personally, I don't think I could follow-up how many stocks?
Jason Moser: I'm with you. I mean, we're always enjoying talking about this because there's so many different answers and there's not one set correct answer. It does depend on the individual. I mean myself I own 34 different companies in my portfolio now. That's enough for me at this point to not know what is happening to any given holding on any given day, I will say that. A stock could be selling off, and I'm like none the wiser because I'm well-diversified, I just take that longer view. I feel like from that perspective I have enough. It is to the point I think I start adding more, I'm not going to really deal with closely follow-up all of them either. I mean, it's just such a tricky answer because you can certainly do very well just amassing a big collection of hundreds and hundreds of stocks through the years. In the counterargument to that is that you become a little bit more like your own little version of a fund that could ultimately drag returns down with underperformers. I think it's just always a good idea to revisit your portfolio annually and check-in on those companies that aren't performing up to your expectations because that can help you pull some of those weeds while watering some other flowers along the way.
Chris Hill: Maria, part of it comes down to the sleep factor. Like if you're losing sleep at night because you're realizing I own too many stocks and I genuinely do want to be able to follow them, there's only so much time in the day.
Maria Gallagher: I think having more than 40-50 sounds very overwhelming to me personally. What I like to do is I know that they said that they own some ETFs and I think that if you see yourself naturally going toward a certain area, a certain sector, seeing, I actually already own 15 healthcare companies, let me look at some healthcare ETFs, and then you own the ETF, then for me that's less overwhelming and so you have some of the companies you really want to follow, the ones you really want to keep up-to-date on as your personal holdings. Then you have ETFs that will diversify you in other areas of interest that you can follow a little bit more passively. I like to have a nice little balance of active and passive, but that's me personally, if you want to go up to hundreds of stocks and you think you can sleep at night and you're excited about looking at them all the time, I would think for it, but for me, I like to have a nice little balance.
Chris Hill: Let's go to our man behind-the-glass, Dan Boyd. It's time for stocks on our radar, Dan's going to hit you with a question. Jason Moser, you're up first, what are you looking at this week?
Jason Moser: Sure thing. Checking out Nvidia, ticker, NVDA, certainly a name, I don't think many members and listeners know well. I do really like this pullback from recent hires are coming off of another impressive showing at CES 2022 where they displayed a lot of really fascinating technology. Cloud gaming, really starting to gain traction represents a growing opportunity in that $300 billion gaming market opportunity. They continue to invest in the autonomous vehicle opportunity with its drive Hyperion platform. The Datacenter opportunity of course still exist and we can't forget about the metaverse. I think while we hear a lot of talk about the metaverse and what exactly it is and how companies will approach it, NVIDIA, taking the approach with its Omniverse platform. It's real-time 3D design collaboration and virtual world platform. Ultimately what they call it is the metaverse for engineers. I think there's going to be a lot of potential there in the coming years as well. On the best of all, I mean, in this world of unprofitable high fliers, Nvidia makes cash and a lot of it, they chalked up $7.2 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months. I think this pullback really does look like an opportunity to add to this winter.
Chris Hill: Dan question about Nvidia?
Dan Boyd: Absolutely. Chris, and Jason, Nvidia sounds like it has a lot going on, but in my brain, when I think Nvidia, I still think chipmaker. There's great graphics cards a lot of people will have to put in their computers. How is the semiconductor shortage really affecting this company?
Jason Moser: I mean, it's affecting all companies in the space, but I do believe it's also a situation where we're seeing the strong gets stronger. This is a business that it's got it's handled in a lot of different cookie jar. To speak, pursuing a lot of different market opportunities there, which I think is ultimately to its benefits. Hopefully, we'll see some legislation here in 2022 that eases some of that supply chain crunch. But for now, Nvidia being one of the strongest players in the space is still weathering it nicely.
Chris Hill: Maria Gallagher, what are you looking at?
Maria Gallagher: I'm assuming my time looking at Adyen, which is an over-the-counter company with ticker symbol A-D-Y-E-Y. It's a one-size-fits-all payment platform, both online, in-person payments, other services like fraud-protection. They have customers like McDonald's at the eBay. Their revenue net income has tripled since 2018. Spending more time looking at the payment space and then this company in particular is what I'm interested in.
Chris Hill: Dan, question about Adyen.
Dan Boyd: This sounds suspiciously, Maria, like a war on cash stock. Did Jason feed you this company before the show because this is really the thing that usually write-up his alley.
Maria Gallagher: Jason doesn't have a monopoly on having a war on cash basket. I think he's interested.
Dan Boyd: I'm sorry.
Chris Hill: Dan, what do you want to add to your watch list?
Dan Boyd: I'm already in Nvidia shareholders. I'm going to go with Adyen because I don't know much about the company and its piqued my interest.
Jason Moser: That's great, you pick my idea.
Chris Hill: Jason Moser, and Maria Gallagher, thanks for being here.
Maria Gallagher: Thanks for having us.
Chris Hill: That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money radio show. Show's mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Chris Hill. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next time.

2022-01-28 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Popped Today,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-popped-today-1,"What happened
Volatile Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock, which has suffered through more down days than up days so far this year, is having a rare green day on Friday, as shares of the semiconductor giant inch up 2.1% as of 12:10 p.m. ET.
What's moving Nvidia stock higher today? At least a couple of things, I imagine.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
First and foremost, at a recent P/E ratio of 70, Nvidia stock -- while far from cheap -- nonetheless costs a whole lot less than it did as recently as just late last year, when shares of the graphics chips specialist were regularly changing hands for 90 times earnings and up. Viewed in the context of those prices, even 70 times earnings actually kind of looks like a bargain.
At the same time, investors in Nvidia still have a few weeks to wait before Nvidia delivers its next batch of earnings news on Feb. 16. In the meantime, investors may be parsing the latest earnings news from other stocks in the semiconductor space for clues to Nvidia's own future.
Now what
And what are those other stocks saying? Just this week, computer memory maker Seagate boasted of having an ""outstanding year"" in 2021 and predicted that 2022 would be even better given ""favorable demand trends"" in the computing space.
Seagate rival Western Digital echoed sentiments about 2021 being better than expected, and said computer memory demand remains strong ""across our end markets"" in 2022 (a fact that's only hurting Western Digital's business because of ""supply chain disruptions""). And Intel, while roundly criticized for warning of weak gross margin and weaker profits in the coming quarter, nonetheless guided higher on revenue than analysts were expecting -- indicating that demand is still strong for semiconductors.
Even better (for Nvidia), in a note commenting on Intel's news yesterday, TheFly.com noted that Intel was ""still losing share."" The logical implication of that is that someone else -- someone perhaps named Nvidia -- is probably gaining share. And that right there sounds to me like a good reason for optimism about Nvidia.

There’s no denying that the metaverse is going to be one of the defining market trends of 2022. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is hard at work on an augmented reality (AR) device while metaverse momentum has sent other stocks such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Matterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) to impressive heights. Plus, experts see promising things ahead for metaverse cryptos. One name that some of us might not have initially counted among metaverse stocks, though, is Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). One analyst has a different take, though. As he sees it, BBY stock could be among the winners of the boom that the dawn of the metaverse is about to usher in.

What’s Happening With BBY Stock
This morning brought the release of a news story that has had BBY stock rising throughout the day. Anthony Chukumba, managing director of Loop Capital, has issued a note in which he states that the company is “well-positioned to tap into enthusiasm for nonfungible tokens, gaming and socializing in a virtual world.”
This is exactly the type of coverage that can send a stock up, especially in 2022. As of this writing, BBY is up 1.3% for the day, showing a pattern of steady, albeit slow, growth. These gains have the stock in the green by 0.23% for the week. However, it remains in the red for the month by almost 3%. Best Buy rose consistently throughout October 2021, only to plunge in November by almost as much due to investors concerns about reported earnings.
Why It Matters
It goes without saying that the retail sector has taken a beating throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. Best Buy certainly hasn’t been immune to this. This new competitive edge, though, may be exactly what the stock needs to get back on track. Chukumba certainly thinks so. He raised his price target on BBY stock to $150, an increase of roughly 52% from where it currently trades. In addition, he reiterated the stock’s buy rating.
The case he made for BBY stock makes sense. The metaverse is going to continue driving interest in consumer electronics as new devices are pioneered and metaverse gaming is expanded. And for all the turbulence it’s seen in recent years, Best Buy remains the most established name in big box electronic sales throughout the country. It also provides both a physical location for curious shoppers to try devices with a team of experts who can advise them on the new technology. There’s a clear appeal to purchasing AR and virtual reality (VR) devices at Best Buy.
We’re also seeing more and more companies find ways to cash in on the metaverse boom. Analysts have praised Nike (NYSE:NKE) for its decision to expand into it, as well as for its partnership with fellow metaverse stock Roblox (NYSE:RBLX). Reports have indicated that Gap (NYSE:GPS) is considering venturing into the metaverse, as digital fashion becomes an industry of its own.
What It Means
The non-fungible token (NFT) enthusiasm of which Chukumba speaks is also increasing as metaverse momentum mounts. Best Buy is indeed well-positioned at the top of a field that some were counting out less than a year ago. The rush to acquire the newest metaverse tech absolutely has the power to breathe new life into the retail sector.
BBY stock has had a difficult season, but if today is any indication, it may be in for a turnaround. The race to the metaverse is in full swing and that means new devices that tech buffs will want. Additionally, companies are beginning to explore the concept of metaverse workplaces. These are all reasons to keep an eye on BBY stock in the months ahead.

We’re in the thick of earnings season, with more big reports due up after the close and again on Thursday. With that in mind, let’s look at a few top stock trades going into the back-half of the week.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Click to Enlarge

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) ripped higher at the open following better-than-expected earnings. However, those gains were halved just a few hours later.
That said, just look at how far this stock has come in the last few days after its violent bounce off $100. Shares came up just short of the December low and the 50% retracement.
However, as long as it remains above last week’s high and the 10-day moving average, bulls may be able to maintain control. If lost, the $110 level and the 200-day may be next.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Nvidia (NVDA)

As for its older brother, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) rallied in sympathy with AMD stock Wednesday morning, although not as much. Both of these stocks are winners, both surged to new highs in November and both corrected about 39.5%.
A lot of similarities — just like Wednesday morning’s fade.
I liked Nvidia off the weekly-up rotation near $240 and also liked the idea of trimming the stock near $260, around this morning’s open.
What I want to see now is similar to AMD stock. Can Nvidia hold the 10-day moving average and last week’s high?
If it can’t, the 200-day is on deck. If it can, though, we want to see it take out today’s high and push into the $275 area. Above that puts the 50-day in play, followed by $293-ish.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Facebook (FB)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
I typically do four stocks in this line-up, but I wanted to throw my levels out on Meta (NASDAQ:FB). I’ll keep it quick.
Near the middle of its recent range, Facebook has already enjoyed five big rallies. On the upside, watch $336-ish, which is the 50% retracement and 200-day.
Above that is the $348 to $352 area, which is the 61.8% retracement, fourth-quarter resistance and the December high.
On the downside, however, watch $308 to $310. Below that and $300 is in play.

Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Qualcomm (QCOM)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
I have said for weeks now that Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has a beautiful weekly chart and the stock’s bounce from the 21-week moving average highlights it.
Now back into a potential resistance zone, we want to see if earnings can break this one out. If it does, $195.75 is an area to keep an eye on. It’s the larger zone’s 161.8% extension and just above the current highs.
If it’s anything like AMD’s report, though, $200-plus could be on the table. In that case, keep an eye on $215, as we look for the current range’s next extension level.
On the downside, though, keep $174.50 in mind — last week’s high and the 10-week moving average — followed by the breakout level near $168.
Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: AbbVie (ABBV)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Lastly, we have AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). This stock has been a relative strength leader, and we have liked it for that reason. However, it has been sluggish today despite reporting earnings.
Shares were able to open lower and push to new highs as bulls bought the dip. That’s great.
From here, though, $138 will be a key line in the sand, in my opinion. If it holds, bulls are in control and can potentially look up to the $144 area for the next upside target.
On the downside, however, a break and a sustained move below $138 opens the door to lower prices.

2022-02-03 00:00:00+00:00,PREVIEW-Storm clouds gather at SoftBank Group as valuations slide,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/preview-storm-clouds-gather-at-softbank-group-as-valuations-slide,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Storm clouds hang over SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T as it prepares to report third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, with the valuations of top portfolio companies slipping and heavyweights departing the Japanese technology conglomerate.
Major SoftBank assets that went public over the last year and are now trading below their listing price include ridehailing company Didi Global DIDI.N, e-commerce firm Coupang CPNG.K and used-car platform Auto1 Group AG1G.DE.
In the quarter that ended Dec. 31, artificial intelligence firm SenseTime 0020.HK was a bright spot but others, such as Paytm parent One 97 Communications PAYT.NS, have disappointed.
""The valuations they've made just haven't held up,"" said Redex Research analyst Kirk Boodry. ""There's a lot more scepticism.""
The new year has offered little respite to Chief Executive Masayoshi Son: January was a bruising month, as investors turned away from growth stocks promising future profits.
""This looks to be a far more critical time for SoftBank than in 2020, when some of its big bets like WeWork and Oyo had gone sour,"" Asymmetric Advisors analyst Amir Anvarzadeh, who recommends shorting the firm, wrote in a note.
SoftBank is struggling to get investors to reevaluate its shares, which are down by about half since last year's March highs. The group launched a 1 trillion yen ($8.7 billion) buyback in November.
""We aren't convinced that anything other than drastic markdowns would allow markets to declare that the downside risk is all priced in,"" LightStream Research analyst Mio Kato wrote in a note on the Smartkarma platform.
As the firm winds down its SB Northstar trading arm, it is funneling funds to its second Vision Fund, which has invested smaller sums than its first iteration in more than 150 startups.
One major reason for the group's buyback last year was ongoing executive frustration at the size of the conglomerate discount, or the gap between the value of its assets and its share price.
The sale of chip designer Arm to Nvidia, which could have unlocked funds for further share repurchases, is widely expected to fall through because of regulatory hurdles. An initial public listing is seen as an alternative but analysts question the prospects for such a move.
""We are sceptical that an outright IPO of Arm will result in value creation for SBG shareholders,"" Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note.
Other assets include stakes in e-commerce firm Alibaba, whose shares have slid drastically as China tech is hammered by regulatory action, and telco SoftBank Corp, which is trading below its listing price.
Top executives, including Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, have moved to exit the company. The shift cements Vision Fund chief Rajeev Misra's pivotal role as SoftBank prioritises investing through that unit.

2022-02-04 00:00:00+00:00,Be Choosy In Tech Investing: ETFs to Buy/Sell,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/be-choosy-in-tech-investing%3A-etfs-to-buy-sell,"Wall Street has been on choppy ride since the start of 2022 due to rising rate worries. Higher inflationary expectations emanating from supply chain disruptions as well as higher crude prices should make Fed members comfortable with several rate hikes in the coming days with the first one since 2018 likely to hit the market in March.
The Nasdaq, heavy on technology and growth stocks, has been extremely hit due to this trend. The index had already entered the correction territory in January. The Nasdaq Composite has lost 7.8% this year as investors continue to walk out of the high-growth tech shares as interest rates surge to start the new year (read: Nasdaq ETFs to Log Worst Month Since 2008? 5 Stocks Up 20%+).
Heavy reliance on the tech sector led to this lackluster performance. No wonder, Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK has lost about 8.6% in the year-to-date frame. But this does not mean that the entire sector is in the lackluster shape. In fact, the latest dip can be used to buy some hidden gems.
Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few tech ETF spaces that should bought or sold right now.
Winners
Semiconductor
Per the Semiconductor Industry Association, global sales of semiconductors totaled $144.8 billion during the third quarter of 2021, marked an increase of 27.6% over the third quarter of 2020 and 7.4% from the second quarter of 2021. Although the industry is grappling with a chip crunch, the ever-increasing demand is a plus for the space.
“Semiconductor shipments reached all-time highs in the third quarter of 2021, demonstrating both the ongoing high global demand for chips and the industry’s extraordinary efforts to ramp up production to meet that demand,” said John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO. The latest upbeat earnings from Nvidia NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD also points to the industry’s wellbeing.
Dynamic Semiconductors Invesco ETF PSI and Vaneck Semiconductor ETF SMH are two choices out of many that could be loaded up in one’s portfolio with a long-term view.
Cybersecurity
Data breaches are rife amid the emerging work-from-home trend. Years’ worth of digital transformation has taken place in the peak of pandemic. Digital uses of the financial transaction are on the rise. Hence, as estimated by the research firm Gartner, global cybersecurity spending jumped 13% in 2021 to $172 billion versus 8% growth in 2020.
In both 2022 and 2023, Gartner predicts 11% growth in cybersecurity spending, per an article published on investors.com. First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF CIBR, iShares Cybersecurity & Tech ETF IHAK, Global X Cybersecurity ETF (BUG) and WisdomTree Cybersecurity Fund (WCBR) could be tapped for gains.
Apple-Microsoft-Heavy ETFs
Betting big on big tech seems to be a good idea. But here also, one needs to be vigilant and it is better go for Apple and Microsoft-heavy ETFs given their latest earnings strength. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT and Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF (FTEC) fit the bill in this regard.
Video Gaming
The video gaming industry continues to gain amid the health crisis as consumers spend generously, hitting record-breaking highs in 2021. Recently-released data from The NPD Group emphasizes that the video game industry witnessed robust sales in 2021, with people spending $60.4 billion in all, reflecting 8% growth year over year. Thanks to the rising demand, the space has seen a big-ticket acquisition lately as Microsoft (MSFT) has agreed to buy gaming giant Activision Blizzard (ATVI) for $68.7 billion. Wedbush ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF GAMR is an apt bet for this segment (read: Grab These Video Gaming ETFs to Gain From Soaring Sales Trend).
Losers
Social Media
Global X Social Media ETF SOCL lost about 6% post Meta (FB) earnings. Facebook lost daily users for the first time in its history and shares sank more than 20%. Taking cues from its struggling social media business, Twitter (TWTR) lost 4.2% on Feb 2 and 6.6% before market on Feb 3. Hence, we can expect a rough ride for SOCL in the near term.
Internet
Internet ETF Invesco NASDAQ Internet ETF PNQI consists of some companies that have seen downbeat earnings this season. Meta, Netflix and PayPal are some of them. So, PNQI may see choppy trades ahead.
Software
Many of the Invesco Dynamic Software ETF PSJ’scomponents – Roku, Datadog and Snap – were winners in the pandemic. With economic reopening taking place, we do not see the winning momentum to continue for the space. Meanwhile, the Meta episode hit the other industry player Snap hard on Feb 2. Most of these companies are likely to face slower user growth.

This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.37% loss on the day.
Heading into today, shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence had lost 10.75% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 8.73% and the S&P 500's loss of 6.01% in that time.
Investors will be hoping for strength from Nvidia as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 16, 2022. On that day, Nvidia is projected to report earnings of $1.22 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 56.41%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.43 billion, up 48.53% from the year-ago period.

On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up by 80 points. The markets are opening today to what seems to be another turbulent week as mixed corporate earnings begin to pour in so far. Also, with investors eagerly awaiting Thursday’s inflation data from the Labor Department, it is easy to see why everyone is on the edge in the last few weeks. Mixed fourth-quarter results from U.S. tech giants like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) have weighed in on investors. As we go through the week, blue-chip companies like Disney (NYSE: DIS) and Uber (NYSE: UBER) will all report their financials.
On the pharmaceutical side of things, Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) reported its earnings today. The company reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter and also raised its full-year forecast for sales of its coronavirus vaccine. In detail, it expects to sell $32 billion of its vaccine shot and $22 billion of its antiviral coronavirus treatment pill Paxlovid in 2022. However, the company missed fourth-quarter revenue and the stock is down by over 4% on today’s opening bell.
Among the Dow Jones leaders, shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are up 0.18% today while Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is down by 0.13%. 3M (NYSE: MMM) and Nike (NYSE: NKE) are trading mixed on Tuesday. Among the Dow financial leaders, Visa (NYSE: V) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) are trading mixed as well today.
Shares of EV leader Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are up by 0.43% on Tuesday. Rival EV companies like Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) are down by 0.41% and 2.84% respectively today. Chinese EV leaders like Nio (NYSE: NIO) and Xpeng Motors (NYSE: XPEV) opened higher at 0.85% and 0.77% respectively.

Dow Jones Today: 10-Year Treasury Yield Surges To Pandemic-Era High
Following the stock market opening on Tuesday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are trading 0.08% and 0.18% lower. The Dow, however, is up by 0.32%. Among exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) is down 0.59% on Tuesday, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: SPY) is also down by 0.39%. 
The 10-year Treasury yield topped 1.94% on Tuesday morning, the highest since November 2019 ahead of Thursday’s key consumer inflation data. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be closely watched on Thursday as it is likely to show another multi-decade high on inflation figures. This would likely prompt the Fed to assume a more hawkish policy to deal with rising inflation.
The Dow looks steady today after an uncommon and quiet start to the week. Component companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) will be reporting its financials on Thursday. Also, U.S. oil prices declined by around 2% as the West Texass Intermediate crude slipped back below $90 a barrel after topping $93 a barrel last week.

Velodyne Stock Skyrockets On News Of Amazon Pact
Among the top gainers in the stock market today would be Velodyne Lidar (NASDAQ: VLDR). Evidently, VLDR stock is up by over 14% on today’s opening bell. Overall, this is likely thanks to the company’s recent move involving Amazon. Namely, the duo are now part of an ongoing agreement involving a share purchase warrant. Because of this, Amazon now has the option to purchase 39.6 million units of VLDR stock. Should it decide to do so, Amazon will be operating via its Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings subsidiary. Through the current 8-K filing, Amazon can make discretionary payments of up to $200 million. The likes of which are according to existing commercial agreements between both firms.
By and large, some would argue that this could be a win-win situation for the duo. Firstly, the benefits here for Velodyne are, arguably, quite clear. With Amazon reportedly interested in the firm, investors are likely tuning in to VLDR stock now. In turn, this could also serve to expose newer investors to Velodyne’s pioneering work in autonomous vehicle (AV) sensors. The likes of which involve its breakthrough contributions in real-time surround view light detection and ranging (lidar) radar tech. Secondly, this is where Amazon comes into the picture. In essence, good relations with Velodyne could serve to bolster Amazon’s push towards a driverless delivery fleet. Nevertheless, investors will likely be eyeing VLDR stock today.

Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Dip As SoftBank Confirms Termination Of Arm Acquisition
In other news, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) seems to be turning heads in the stock market now. This would be a result of the latest announcement from Arm Holdings, parent company, SoftBank. As of today, the duo are officially terminating the highly anticipated Arm acquisition by Nvidia. This comes as massive news for the booming semiconductor chip industry now. According to the press release, both firms are citing “significant regulatory challenges,” as the main reason for this. This is apparent as Nvidia did receive regulatory pushbacks from the U.S., U.K., and China regarding this acquisition. With the scrapping of the $40 billion deal, NVDA stock appears to be taking the heat. As it stands, the company’s shares are trading lower by 0.69% today.
Following this termination, Nvidia will be paying a $1.25 billion fee for failing to complete the transaction. Not to mention, SoftBank is now opting to bring Arm public via an initial public offering (IPO). According to SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son the firm is likely targeting a U.S. IPO by March 2023. While all this may seem like a major loss for Nvidia, some analysts are saying otherwise. Just last month, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) analyst Vivek Arya and his team weighed in on Nvidia’s prospects after terminating this deal. They suggest that this is a “net positive” for the chip giant. 
In the larger scheme of things, the bank believes that the immense resources going towards the deal would be put to better use fortifying Nvidia’s key growth areas. These include but are not limited to its artificial intelligence, metaverse, gaming, and enterprise solutions. With all this in mind, NVDA stock could be worth watching now.

Tech stocks are recovering and showing strong signs of a rebound. With several stocks down since the start of the year, now is a great chance to add them to your portfolio. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a hot tech company that is only growing with each passing year.
Source: Steve Lagreca / Shutterstock.com
Call it data center gains or the massive growth in the gaming segment, there is no stopping the momentum of the company. NVDA stock was trading close to $150 last year and is trading at $243 today.
The stock went as high as $333 in November and has shown volatility since then. However, I believe the stock has massive growth potential and it is a good addition to your portfolio.
What To Expect In Fourth Quarter Results
In the third quarter, the company reported record revenue of $3.22 billion from the gaming business, which was a 5% increase from the previous quarter and 42% higher than the same period a year ago. It also saw a massive rise in revenue from data centers, which was up 55% year over year.
The 7 Highest Dividend Stocks for Income Investors
As the company gears up to report the fourth-quarter results on Feb. 16, there is ample optimism among investors. Nvidia has already beaten the analyst expectations for the past six consecutive quarters. It expects revenue of $7.40 billion and an EPS of $1.22. I believe the company will be able to meet its projections and could impress investors with more details about the Omniverse.
However, there is news that Nvidia is planning to abandon the acquisition of Arm. But this shouldn’t affect the fundamentals of the company or the potential of NVDA stock. It is one tech stock that can outpace the S&P 500 and could reap strong returns for investors.
Gaming and data center are the top two revenue-generating segments for Nvidia but it doesn’t stop there. The company also has a presence across several industries and segments. It has massive growth potential in the automotive segment and the industry is hot today.
Do not worry about the Arm deal or the cryptocurrency mining segment. Even if the company only focuses on the top two segments, it will be able to generate significant revenue.
Nvidia still has a lot of potential to expand and attract new users. NVDA stock is proof that the company is on the right track and will continue to grow in the coming years.
The Bottom Line On NVDA Stock
New Street analyst Pierre Farrago has a “neutral” rating on the stock with a target price of $250. The analyst is of the opinion that because Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is down more than 40% from its peaks, mining volumes will decline in the coming 6 months and the crypto demand for GPUs will drop accordingly. This could lead to a dip in the excess shipments and thus affect the inventory.
The analyst adds that Nvidia might anticipate the situation and reduce the shipments to avoid piling up inventory. This situation could lead to a pullback in shares and it could be a perfect opportunity to buy the dip.
However, I do not think NVDA stock will go as low as $150 anytime soon, and if the company reports strong quarterly results, the stock is going to soar. Now is the right time to make an addition to your portfolio.
Nvidia is a company that never fails to impress investors and it is a solid long-term buy. There is ample growth potential and an opportunity to make the most of the thriving automotive industry across the world.
With a solid lineup of products, there is no stopping the growth momentum of Nvidia. Buy NVDA stock before the results to make the most of the rise.

2022-02-10 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting NVDA Put And Call Options For April 1st,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-nvda-put-and-call-options-for-april-1st,"Investors in NVIDIA Corp (Symbol: NVDA) saw new options become available today, for the April 1st expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the NVDA options chain for the new April 1st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $240.00 strike price has a current bid of $12.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $240.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $228.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of NVDA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $264.64/share today.
Because the $240.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.00% return on the cash commitment, or 36.53% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for NVIDIA Corp, and highlighting in green where the $240.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $285.00 strike price has a current bid of $14.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of NVDA stock at the current price level of $264.64/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $285.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.02% if the stock gets called away at the April 1st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if NVDA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for NVIDIA Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing NVDA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $285.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $285.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.33% boost of extra return to the investor, or 38.93% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $264.64) to be 46%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Feb 11 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks ended sharply lower on Friday for the second straight session, as investors fretted about deepening tensions between Russia and Ukraine.
Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes declined, led by technology .SPLRCT, down 3.0%, and consumer discretionary .SPLRCD, down 2.8%. The energy sector index .SPNH surged 2.8% as oil prices hit seven-year highs.
With investors already fretting about inflation and rising interest rates, selling on Wall Street accelerated after Washington warned that Russia had massed enough troops near Ukraine to launch a major invasion, and that an attack could begin any day.
""We just have to see how this plays out over the weekend and whether or not international leadership can bring this under wraps,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York. ""If not, then the knock-on effects could be material, and that's what the markets is worried about.""
Nvidia Corp NVDA.O tumbled 7.3%, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O dropped 3.6%, and Apple Inc AAPL.O and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O both lost over 2%. The four companies weighed more than any others on the S&P 500's .SPX decline.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 1.43% to end at 34,738.06 points, while the S&P 500 .SPX lost 1.90% at 4,418.64.
The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 2.78% to 13,791.15.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX sank 4.83%.
U.S. exchanges were busy, with 13.4 billion shares changing hands, compared with a 12.6 billion average over the last 20 trading days.
Wall Street's latest sell-off follows a slump on Thursday, when data showed consumer prices surged 7.5% in January, the biggest annual increase in 40 years. Comments from St. Louis Fed Bank President James Bullard about aggressive rate hikes have also rattled investor sentiment.
For the week, the S&P 500 fell 1.8% and the Nasdaq shed 2.2%.
Traders are pricing in a half-point rate hike in March with just a scant chance of a smaller quarter-point raise, and heavy bets for a policy path that would bring rates to a range of 1.75%-2.00% by the end of the year.
""If the Ukraine is attacked, it adds more credence to our view that the Fed will be more dovish than the market currently believes as the war would make the outlook even more uncertain,"" said Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at Infrastructure Capital Management in New York.
A University of Michigan survey showed U.S. consumer sentiment fell to its lowest in more than a decade in early February on expectations that inflation would continue to rise in the near term.
The CBOE volatility index .VIX, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, was up for a second straight session and hit its highest level since the end of January.
Online real-estate platform Zillow Group Inc ZG.O jumped 12.7% after beating Wall Street estimates for quarterly sales, boosted by an 11-fold revenue increase in its homes segment.
Under Armour Inc UAA.N slumped 12.5% after warning that its profit margin would be under pressure in the current quarter.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.54-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and 13 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 40 new highs and 208 new lows.

NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Wall Street indexes turned sharply lower on Monday, as news that the United States is closing its Kyiv embassy in Ukraine heightened geopolitical tensions and prompted a sell-off in choppy trading.
All three major indexes fell after the Wall Street Journal reported on the relocation of U.S. diplomatic operations to western Ukraine, in a possible harbinger of imminent Russian invasion.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged state officials, politicians and business leaders who have recently left the country to return within 24 hours to show unity. ""We have been told that February 16 will be the day of the attack, but we will make it the day of unity,"" he said.
""Investors don't like uncertainty, and this is obviously a period of increased uncertainty and that's why you're seeing this volatility,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.
Geopolitical anxieties have been simmering in recent weeks as negotiators scrambled to find a diplomatic path forward as Russia amassed troops along the Ukrainian border.
Adding to the uncertainty were increasingly hawkish comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, reiterating his call for a faster rake hike timeline and saying the central bank's ""credibility is on the line"" in its battle against rising prices.
""We're contending with two major concerns,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut. ""What are we going to see from the Federal Reserve and what are we going to see from Russia?""
Recent data showed U.S. inflation at its hottest level in decades, ratcheting up concerns that the Fed could begin hiking key interest rates more aggressively than many had anticipated.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 381.13 points, or 1.1%, to 34,356.93, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 46.05 points, or 1.04%, at 4,372.59 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 99.62 points, or 0.72%, to 13,691.53.
Fourth-quarter earnings season is approaching the home stretch, with 358 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 78% have beat consensus estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
NVidia Corp NVDA.O and Walmart Inc WMT.N are among the high profile companies posting results this week.
COVID vaccine makers Pfizer Inc PFE.N, Moderna Inc MRNA.O, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax Inc NVAX.O were down between 2% and 12.8%%.
""The primaries are coming, and governors are reducing mask mandates and people think the crisis is over,"" Pavlik said.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 3.75-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.70-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 18 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 22 new highs and 220 new lows.

Semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) got another lift on Tuesday morning when investment bank Piper Sandler predicted -- on the day before fourth-quarter earnings arrive -- that Nvidia will deliver a ""significant beat and raise,"" as StreetInsider.com reported this morning.
As of 10:10 a.m. ET today, shares are up a solid 6% in response.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
""Overall, demand [for Nvidia's chips] continues to be strong for gaming given the adoption of RTX GPUs with ray tracing,"" Piper Sandler said this morning.
Even more important for long-term investors, Piper isn't just predicting a one-day pop in the stock price after earnings come out and beat expectations. The analyst said: ""In our eyes, this growth appears to be in the early-to-mid stages of the growth curve, and with no signs of supply alleviating in the near term, it provides a nice backdrop for the gaming segment. On the data center side, we have heard from several companies that data center trends are very strong, which should benefit Nvidia.""
Now what
In short, Piper Sandler is predicting that Nvidia will exceed expectations for 48% quarterly revenue growth and 58% earnings growth in its fourth-quarter report. But it's also predicting that the company will continue growing over the long term because the cyclical semiconductors industry is only in the early stages (or at worst, the middle) of its cycle of rising demand for chips, a cycle that should keep on growing for a few more years.
Assuming Piper is right, Nvidia is likely to comment on this trend in its earnings report tomorrow afternoon, and probably will raise guidance right after reporting on earnings. Considering that analysts were already expecting that the chipmaker will earn $4.34 per share in 2022 -- delivering 74% more profit than in 2021, on 60% revenue growth -- any raise in guidance that it delivers will mean that 2022 is going to be a great year to own Nvidia stock.

Fiverr International (NYSE: FVRR) stock is sinking again today. The gig-economy specialist's share price was down roughly 10.3% in the daily session as of 2:15 p.m. ET Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite index was down roughly 0.9%.
High-profile tech companies including Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), Nvidia, and Roblox have recently reported earnings and seen significant sell-offs, and the trend appears to be impacting Fiverr. The gig-labor company is set to publish fourth-quarter earnings results before the market opens on Thursday, and it looks like investors are selling out of the stock after surveying moves for other growth names on the heels of earnings.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Many growth-dependent tech stocks are seeing significant sell-offs in Wednesday's trading, but Shopify's Q4 report, guidance, and post-earnings pullback are likely the biggest catalysts in the sell-off for Fiverr stock. Shopify published its Q4 results before the market opened on Wednesday, and its stock is getting hammered despite the company posting sales and earnings for the quarter that topped the market's expectations.
The e-commerce specialist told investors that sales growth would slow significantly in the first half of this year as pandemic-related tailwinds recede. Fiverr's business has also benefited from surging demand during the pandemic, and investors appear to be interpreting Shopify's guidance as an indication that the gig-labor marketplace will also see its growth slow significantly.
Now what
Fiverr International has seen dramatic sell-offs over the last year as sales growth has slowed and investors have moved out of stocks with highly forward-looking valuations. The stock trades down roughly 75.5% from the high that it hit last February. The company now has a market capitalization of roughly $2.8 billion and is valued at approximately 7.5 times this year's expected sales.
With its last update, Fiverr guided for Q4 sales to come in between $74.5 million and $77.5 million, representing growth of roughly 36% year over year at the midpoint of the target. The company also targeted non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) between $5.5 million and $7 million for the period. Investors will get a look at how the company's Q4 performance stacks up against that guidance tomorrow.

NEW YORK, Feb 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid on Thursday, with the S&P 500 marking its biggest daily percentage drop in two weeks, as investors shifted to defensive sectors and safe havens such as bonds and gold as geopolitical tensions between Washington and Russia over Ukraine flared.
After Ukrainian forces and pro-Moscow rebels traded fire in eastern Ukraine, U.S. President Joe Biden said there was every indication Russia was planning to invade in the next few days and was preparing a pretext to justify it.
Russia accused Biden of stoking tensions and released a strongly worded letter saying Washington was ignoring its security demands and threatening unspecified ""military-technical measures"".
On Wall Street, the growth-oriented technology .SPLRCT and communication services .SPLRCL sectors were among the hardest hit. Financials .SPSY also declined as U.S. Treasury yields moved lower.
Developments in Ukraine have added to uncertainty about the path of the Federal Reserve's tightening plans to fight inflation.
""There's a lot of nervousness out there and as we approach the weekend nothing’s been settled between Russia and Ukraine,"" said Michael James, managing director, equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
""The continued weakness, especially in the growth names, is indicative of elevated nervousness and sellers continuing to swamp buyers in just about every stock.""
The defensive utilities .SPLRCU and consumer staples .SPLRCS sectors were Wall Street's only advancers, with staples getting a lift from a 4.01% jump in Walmart WMT.N after it posted record holiday sales.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 622.24 points, or 1.78%, to 34,312.03, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 94.75 points, or 2.12%, to 4,380.26 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 407.38 points, or 2.88%, to 13,716.72.
The drop for the Dow was the biggest daily percentage decline since Nov. 30 while the Nasdaq's decline was its largest percentage fall since Feb. 3.
With the end of earnings season on the horizon, chipmaker Nvidia NVDA.O tumbled 7.51% as flat gross margins and concern about its exposure to the crypto market overshadowed an upbeat current-quarter revenue forecast, and helped give the Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX its first daily decline this week.
TripAdvisor Inc TRIP.O lost 2.50% after the hotel search website operator posted a surprise fourth-quarter loss. Albemarle Corp ALB.N plunged 19.91% as the lithium producer forecast downbeat annual earnings.
As risk aversion pushed bond yields lower, big banks including JPMorgan Chase JPM.N, Morgan Stanley MS.N and Bank of America BAC.N all lost ground. Goldman Sachs GS.N and Wells Fargo WFC.N fell even after positive outlooks from the lenders.
Gold XAU= was another beneficiary of the move toward safer assets, touching an eight-month high of $1,900.99 an ounce.
Among other big movers, DoorDash Inc DASH.N shot up 10.69% after it reported upbeat quarterly revenue as food delivery demand showed no sign of slowing.
Hasbro Inc HAS.O gained 2.09% after activist investor Alta Fox Capital Management nominated five directors to the toymaker's board and urged changes including a spinoff of its unit housing games such as ""Dungeons & Dragons"".
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.81-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.63-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and 19 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 27 new highs and 249 new lows.

Feb 18 (Reuters) - Intel Corp's INTC.O latest focus on making chips to meet rising demand will give Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O, its biggest rival in the server and PC market, a chance to build a greater foothold in the segment, analysts said.
Intel, which plans large investments in chip technologies in the next four years, said on Thursday it expects revenue from its segment housing PCs to grow in low to mid single digits, and its datacenter and AI business to grow in high teens from 2023 through 2026.
The company's shares fell about 6%, while those of AMD slipped 1% on Friday.
AMD's market cap briefly breached Intel's earlier this week when it closed its $50 billion Xilinx deal. AMD is now about $1 billion short of Intel's roughly $182 billion market cap, both far from Nvidia's NVDA.O $585 billion.
In servers, AMD had less than 5% market share in 2018, but now holds 15%. This could go as high as 25%, WestPark Capital analyst Ruben Roy said. In PCs, he expects AMD market share to reach high 20s from its current 18% to 20% range.
""We think share gains will continue as Intel tries to catch up on manufacturing process tech.""
But Wall Street is less enthused with Intel's latest chip plans, which analysts said lacked ""credibility"" amid tough competition, and include muted gross margin growth and aggressive spending.
Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar said there was no imminent threat to Nvidia and AMD from Intel's ambitious roadmap. ""Intel only plans to find its normal cadence but is not really expected to take any meaningful share.""
Once a market leader in the semiconductor space, Intel gave up its spot to Samsung Electronics in 2021 for the first time since 2018, Gartner data showed, while AMD jumped to the tenth spot from 14.

2022-02-22 00:00:00+00:00,Ukraine and Inflation Fight the Market,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ukraine-and-inflation-fight-the-market,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It’s a perfect storm. As we write to you, inflation worries and uncertainty surrounding a Russian-to-Ukraine invasion are heavily weighing on the market.
These two issues are part of concerning feedback loop; investors tend to bid up the price of energy when geopolitical risks like the Ukraine situation emerge.
Yesterday, we uploaded a bonus video to our Learning Markets YouTube channel to discuss these very issues. You can check it out here.
Now, this whole situation has kept oil prices very elevated.
Right now, it appears that rhetoric from the Kremlin about recognizing “separatist regions” in Eastern Ukraine, will keep uncertainty building and energy prices rising.
Currently, West Texas Intermediate oil is priced over $90 per barrel. On an inflation-adjusted basis, this is higher than the average price the last time energy spiked (2014). While this isn’t a market killer yet, high energy prices are an important component of inflationary pressure.
We have recommended long energy positions several times over the last two months in this column, and those trades have done very well. But the bottom line is that if oil prices continue to rise it will start to drag on the economy.
The recent data flow — such as last week’s Producer Price Index (PPI) — has only made traders more nervous about inflation. Manufacturers and other producers are paying more for their materials thanks to inflation, so they charge consumers like you more.
However, there are a couple of announcements later this week that could give us some relief if they show pricing pressure is starting to ease:
On Thursday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis will release preliminary GDP results for the fourth quarter of 2021. Now, we know this doesn’t sound like a market-moving event because the data is so old, but it has a big impact on sentiment.
After growing by 4-6% in the first two quarters last year, GDP growth dropped back to its normal range of 2.1% in the third quarter. We don’t think it’s a coincident that “normal” GDP numbers flattened some of the enthusiasm for stocks after that report. More importantly, GDP comes with an inflation number called the “deflator.”
We don’t think the deflator will surprise anyone, but it might show some easing in pricing pressure and that could make a big difference for traders.
Additionally, on Friday the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) numbers come out. This inflation report doesn’t usually get the kind of press that CPI does, but you should care about it a lot because the Federal Reserve cares about it.
Right now, traders think PCE will come in about where it did last month (about 6% annualized inflation), which wouldn’t be great for the market. If it comes in higher, we may have to adjust our outlook a little more negatively. However, there continue to be signs that supply chain issues are easing enough to help with inflation so there is a real possibility of a surprise.
If PCE is lower than expected, we think investors will jump back into inflation-sensitive sectors — like technology and retail — with both feet. On our watchlist are the cash-flow leaders in those sectors like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), and Target (NYSE:TGT) following the report.
We know this update got in the weeds a little with all the economic talk, but it’s important to have some perspective right now. Keep in mind that “panic talk” about inflation and rising interest rates gets lots of views and clicks, but it may not reflect what happens in real life.
Yes, we are concerned about rising inflation, which will increase interest rates, but we don’t think you should start stockpiling gold bullion yet and preparing for the end of the world.
Keep in mind that even during the inflationary period of 1976-1983 (including the early 80s recession) the S&P 500 still gained nearly 90%. If the other economic fundamentals are good (earnings, hiring, wages, etc.), then we should keep a positive outlook.
By the end of this week, we will know a lot more about the situation in Ukraine and inflation that can help us make a better estimate for when this round of volatility will end, and we can be buyers again.

2022-02-23 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia Stock: Bear vs. Bull,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock%3A-bear-vs.-bull-0,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) posted a strong fourth-quarter earnings report on Feb. 16 that beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines. However, the chipmaker's stock slumped after the announcement, and remains down roughly 20% for the year.
Does the market's apparent lack of interest in Nvidia represent a good buying opportunity? Let's review the bear and bull cases to find out.
Image source: Getty Images.
What the bears will say about Nvidia
The bears will claim Nvidia's growth is decelerating, its gross margins are approaching a near-term peak, and its stock still looks richly valued.
Nvidia's revenue rose 61% to $26.91 billion in fiscal 2022, which ended this January, accelerating from its 53% growth in fiscal 2021. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 78% in fiscal 2022, which also accelerated from its 73% growth in fiscal 2021. On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, its EPS rose 123% in 2022.
That explosive growth was mainly driven by the expansion of its gaming and data center GPU businesses. Nvidia expanded its market share in the discrete GPU market against AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) over the past year, and shipped a steady supply of top-tier GPUs to data center customers to process complex machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.
However, Nvidia expects its revenue to grow 43% year over year in the first quarter of 2022, and analysts expect its revenue to rise 28% to $34.6 billion for the full year as its EPS grows 14% on a GAAP basis. Its GAAP earnings will include a $1.36 billion writedown related to its failed attempt to buy the U.K. chip designer Arm Holdings from SoftBank (OTC: SFTB.Y).
Nvidia faces tough year-over-year comparisons against the pandemic, which generated tailwinds for the gaming and data center markets, as well as ongoing supply chain constraints. The volatile cryptocurrency mining market will likely cause additional pricing and supply issues for its GPUs and dedicated cryptocurrency mining chips in fiscal 2023.
Nvidia's adjusted gross margin expanded from 62.5% in fiscal 2020 to 65.6% in fiscal 2021, then rose again to 66.8% in fiscal 2022. But for the first quarter, it expects to generate an adjusted gross margin of 67% -- which would remain flat sequentially from the fourth quarter. That forecast suggests Nvidia's near-term gross margins are peaking.
At $236 per share, Nvidia's stock trades at 54 times forward earnings and 17 times its fiscal 2023 sales. Those valuations are still a bit high relative to its near-term growth. By comparison, AMD -- which is expected to grow its revenue and earnings by 56% and 43%, respectively, this year -- trades at 28 times forward earnings and seven times its fiscal 2022 sales.
What the bulls will say about Nvidia
The bulls believe Nvidia's stock is still worth buying because it's well-poised to profit from the secular expansion of several high-growth markets.
As the world's top supplier of high-end gaming GPUs, Nvidia will likely benefit from the growth of the global computer gaming market, which Report Ocean expects to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.9% between 2021 to 2027.
The global data center accelerator market, which Nvidia leads with its high-end GPUs, could also grow at a CAGR of 36.7% between 2021 and 2026, according to Research and Markets. Nvidia also provides Arm-based CPUs for data centers, which could eventually challenge Intel and AMD's x86-based data center CPUs over the next few years.
Nvidia also supplies Tegra CPUs for Nintendo's Switch consoles, set-top boxes, and connected cars, as well as onboard computers for driverless cars. These smaller businesses could expand over the long term and diversify Nvidia's core business away from gaming and data center GPUs.
All those tailwinds suggest that Nvidia could grow its annual revenue at a CAGR of at least 20% over the next decade. If it stays above that threshold, it could generate nearly $120 billion in revenue by fiscal 2030. The bulls will claim those long-term growth rates justify its current valuations.
Lastly, the bulls will point out that Nvidia already generates much higher gross margins than other fabless chipmakers like AMD (48% in fiscal 2021) and Qualcomm (58% in fiscal 2021). Therefore, it might not be surprising (or a red flag) if Nvidia's gross margin ""peaks"" in the high 60s.
Which argument makes more sense?
I believe Nvidia is still a rock-solid investment. However, I believe its decelerating growth, high valuations, and the unpredictable macro headwinds -- which are causing investors to favor value over growth -- could cause investors to shun its stock for at least a few more quarters.

The metaverse has arguably been one of the top buzzwords since Facebook’s much-talked-about rebrand. Little did we know that an Oasis-type virtual world from the 2018 smash-hit Ready Player One would become a reality within a few years. It has gone from fiction to fact, and the world’s top metaverse stocks are all looking to jump in on the action.
The metaverse is an integrated virtual environment where people can connect, work and play online. It will function like the internet at its core, but is likely to be highly immersive and integrated. On top of that, it will have an economy unto itself.
However, a lot of patience is needed here. The metaverse concept will take time to blossom into the juggernaut it’s expected to come. The market is expected to grow to a whopping $800 billion within a few years.
7 of the Top Restaurant Stocks to Serve Up
Hence, investors must tap into the trend early and load up on these metaverse stocks now:
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB)
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)
Roblox (NYSE: RBLX)
Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK)
Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) 
Matterport (NASDAQ:MTTR)
Unity Software (NYSE:U)
Metaverse Stocks: Meta Platforms (FB)

Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, shook up the internet with its strategic shift towards the next technological breakthrough: the metaverse.
The seismic shift came when the company was facing a public relations crisis. However, with the slowdown in user growth, the metaverse pivot was perhaps the need of the hour.
What the metaverse holds for the company is relatively unknown. However, we know Meta Platforms is going all-in to become a potential stalwart in the emerging sector. It has already spent upwards of $60 billion in expanding its metaverse plans from 2014 to 2023.
As we advance, the company’s augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) businesses are likely to blow up and lay the foundation for future growth. With its proven track record for innovation, it won’t be surprising if it can cement its positioning in the sector.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia is an obvious metaverse play considering its leading position in the graphics processing unit (GPU) space. The utility of its GPUs has expanded immensely in sectors such as artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and other verticals apart from gaming.
The GPU giant plans to leverage the power of its robust hardware stack to develop its software capabilities. It has developed a graphics engine called Omniverse, which will enable users to design their metaverses.
Looking ahead, every company will have its metaverse, which is why Omniverse will be of immense value. If it can become the go-to engine for designing virtual worlds, it could be looking at a colossal opportunity down the road.

Roblox is one of the most popular gaming platforms in the world. Its robust ecosystem enables users to create and share experiences in its creative platform.
The platform is hugely successful with the younger demographic, as most of its users are aged 13 and under. As per its most recent quarter, its daily active users soared past 47 million.
Roblox’s 3D platform already has metaverse characteristics and could potentially become a major revenue growth driver. Moreover, it plans to become an advertising titan by leveraging its robust creative platform.
It is already gaining traction with big brands. Additionally, Roblox plans to invest a substantial amount of money into its platform to continue improving the quality of its services. If it can continue to do that, its platform will grow leaps and bounds, making it a successful advertising business.
Autodesk (ADSK)

Autodesk is a leading provider of software tools for engineering and construction markets. Architects and engineers use its building information modeling (BIM) program, Revit, to visualize their designs and subsequently show them to their clients.
Moreover, these designs can then be taken to the next level via plugins such as Autodesk Rendering. Additionally, it offers a whole host of products mainly designed for developing VR and AR 3D animations. Hence, it’s evident it can become a perfect fit for the metaverse.
7 Stocks to Buy After Sentiment Slipped to Lows
During the third quarter, the company’s revenue shot up 13% to $952 million, with subscription revenue forming the bulk of the total. On top of that, GAAP margins remained excellent at roughly 18%. The company’s financials are excellent, and it has plenty of internal resources.
Metaverse Stocks: Cloudflare (NET) 
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Cloudflare is not exactly a metaverse pure-play. However, it is likely to have a massive role in providing the robust networking and data services needed to make the metaverse a reality.
Cloudflare provides an edge-based content delivery network (CDN) that facilitates data efficiency, dependability, speed and safety. Such network characteristics will prove critical in driving the company’s growth in the metaverse.
Perhaps every aspect of the metaverse, from avatars to virtual activities, is likely to be defined by software. The content inside the metaverse must be delivered in a timely and reliable manner to keep users engaged.
Fortunately, that’s what Cloudflare does well, as its CDN powers a significant portion of the web. Moreover, its rock-solid financial performance is a testament to the quality of its product and the effectiveness of its internal management.
Matterport (MTTR)

Matterport is a video capture company that allows construction firms to provide virtual tours of buildings that prospective buyers and tenants can use. It saves time for customers that would otherwise go house hunting and expend their energy on the process. In the wake of Covid-19 restrictions, the business model turned out to be a novel idea.
Apart from video capturing services, the company also stores the virtual spaces it scans and offers a suite of design tools. Total subscribers shot up 116% from the prior-year period in its most-recent quarter, and subscription revenue rose 36%.
7 Hot Stocks That Show No Signs of Cooling Off
The sustainability of its business model is questionable, which is why it represents the riskiest play in the sector. However, it could blossom into a top metaverse company down the line.
Metaverse Stocks: Unity Software (U)

Unity Software is the top designer of 3D worlds. According to the company, more than 50% of all games were developed using Unity’s engine. Hence, the goal is to leverage its success in playing a massive role in the metaverse sector.
CEO John Riccitiello plans to have more than 60% of metaverse content built on the Unity engine. He believes its technology will be used for monetization, analytics and other related elements inside the metaverse.
It recently acquired visual effects producer Weta Digital for $1.6 billion. Weta’s technology has been used in blockbuster films such as Avatar and TV programs like Game of Thrones.
Unity will make Weta’s tools available to produce some high-quality 3D content. As Unity addresses the unique requirements in developing metaverse content, it is poised to become a formidable player in the space.

Is this the year that Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) finally turns things around? After a sizable rally in the first third of the year, INTC stock finished 2021 in a tepid fashion. 2022 has been much worse thus far.
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
The world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturer has been struggling to right its own ship for more than five years now, and has been eclipsed by competitors such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
This fact is reflected in the performance of Intel stock. In the past five years, INTC shares have gained 24%, compared to an 809% gain for NVDA stock and a gain of 700% for shares of AMD. Rival AMD recently celebrated the fact that its market capitalization of $188 billion now eclipses that of Intel’s, which stands at just over $180 billion.
However, after years of stagnant growth, declining market share, and share price underperformance, Intel appears to now have a plan in place that might finally help the Santa Clara, California-based company turn its fortunes around.
New Focus
Pat Gelsinger became Intel’s chief executive officer (CEO) a little over a year ago, on Feb. 15, 2021. He came armed with a five year turnaround plan that will see Intel move away from the design of semiconductor chips to focus instead on becoming a foundry that manufacturers semiconductor chips for other companies, including its current rivals. To that end, Gelsinger has announced that Intel will spend $20 billion erecting new chip factories in Arizona and Ohio.
The 7 Best Web 3.0 Stocks to Buy for March 2022
The company also plans to build a chip plant in Europe. News of the U.S.-based chip facilities was applauded by politicians who have criticized the current reliance on foreign chip foundries amid the ongoing global shortage in semiconductors.
At the same time, Intel is working double time to advance its own technology and come out with new semiconductor chips. The company is working on a server chip that uses extreme ultraviolet lithography and, once complete, will be a major breakthrough for Intel in terms of power and performance.
Over the last decade, Intel has fallen woefully behind its rivals in terms of technological advancements. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), for example, now has microchips that operate on a 5-nanometer node compared to Intel’s 10-nanometer node. TSMC chips are literally twice as powerful and twice as efficient as those designed by Intel. 
A Difficult Turnaround for INTC Stock
While Intel’s plans, and Pat Gelsinger’s vision, sound great, there are indications that advancing the company’s technology and pivoting to manufacturing chips will not be easy.
Case in point, INTC stock fell 5% on February 18 after it was announced during an investor day conference that the release of the heavily hyped new server chip would be delayed until 2024 from an initial date of 2023.
Gelsinger tried to counter skepticism about Intel’s massive turnaround effort, saying during the event that he will double the company’s earnings per share (EPS), but that it will take time and require investors to be patient.
Wall Street analysts and investors appear unwilling to look past Intel’s balance sheet and near-term outlook. Rather than focus on Gelsinger’s rhetoric, investors instead seized on the fact that Intel is forecasting a 4% decline in revenue this year, to $76 billion, due to its ongoing capital expenditures, as well as a sharp drop in profitability, down 27% from 2021 levels to $3.55 a share.
That forward guidance was enough to push INTC stock down further. Year-to-date, the share price has now declined 8% to $47.42. The company has stressed that it is maintaining its dividend, which pays a healthy yield of 3.13%. However, the dividend seems to be providing little comfort to shareholders.
INTC Stock Has a Ways to Go Still
It’s all about execution at this point. While Intel clearly has some lofty goals and an ambitious turnaround plan in place, it remains to be seen if the company can successfully implement its strategy and meet the timelines it has set for itself.
The delayed server chip and earnings downgrade for this year suggest that the company is continuing to struggle right now. As such, investors should take a wait-and-see approach with Intel.
Keep an eye on the company and its stock, but wait until it becomes clear that the ship has turned around before taking a position. In the meantime, there are many other semiconductor stocks that offer superior returns, such as Nvidia and AMD. Right now, INTC stock is not a buy.

In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 1.60% for Qualcomm Inc, 0.07% for NVIDIA Corp, and 1.07% for Shutterstock Inc.

Chris Hill: Past performance is not indicative of future results, except when it really, really is. We'll explain in a bit. Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Chris Hill, joined by Motley Fool Senior Analyst Bill Mann. Thanks for being here.
Bill Mann: Hey Chris, how're you?
Chris Hill: I am doing all right. Cutting investments, cutting jobs, cutting a CEO loose, these are all things that companies do, and they are big decisions, and in one fell swoop, Peloton just did all three.
Bill Mann: They filled the bingo card, didn't they?
Chris Hill: They really did. They announced they're cutting nearly 3,000 jobs. They are no longer going to be building a $400 million factory in Ohio that they had planned. And co-founder John Foley is no longer going to be the CEO. They are bringing in Barry McCarthy, who is the former chief financial officer at Spotify, and then before that, Netflix. He'll be the new CEO. The stock is responding positively, let's just put it that way. Although you could look at Peloton and wonder, how much further does this have to fall? Yesterday, the conversation around Peloton was, ""Who's going to buy this company?"" with the reports around Amazon and Nike, specifically, and, of course, Apple always gets thrown in there. They make these moves now. Let me start with this question. Do you think they are still setting themselves up to be bought by someone, or are these the moves of a business that says, ""We are retooling and we're going to remain independent""?
Bill Mann: I don't know. I haven't heard anything that suggested that Peloton had put itself up for sale at all. There was an activist investor that came out and said, ""These are the companies that could be buying Peloton."" Maybe there's conversations that are going on in the background or maybe it's just some guys throwing some spaghetti at the wall, because there were companies on that list that were bizarre, like Berkshire Hathaway.
Chris Hill: Oracle got name-checked.
Bill Mann: Yeah. Exactly. I am not sure how serious that was with the exception of the fact that Peloton has an unbelievable brand, it has an unbelievable franchise, and it has been misrun. And that is actually a perfect situation for a transaction to take place. But I haven't heard anything that suggests that Peloton was out there putting itself up on the market.
Chris Hill: John Foley talked about the mistakes that he made. He owned those mistakes. It was a guts-to-go situation for Foley, however.
Bill Mann: Yeah, maybe.
Chris Hill: I think that a lot of people, for perfectly understandable reasons, we looked at this business and said, ""Oh my gosh, this was a $50 billion company and now it's a $12 billion company."" Let's take it where it is, because investing is all about the future. This is a $12 billion company. They are laying people off. They are radically cutting back the amount of money that they are investing. What do you see when you look at this business in the wake of these decisions?
Bill Mann: I know you're quoting the stock. It was never a $50 billion company. It was a company that the market got really, really excited about and I think actually rightfully so. Now, I think that Barry McCarthy is a genius CEO appointment because the experience that he's had at Spotify and Netflix -- he has gone through companies that have done very well in the long term, but have endured crises.
Now every single company that has had a hyper-growth period -- and Peloton absolutely had that over, call it 18 months to two years, during the pandemic -- goes through a shift where that hyper-growth period changes. And they are in the midst of it now. It does not necessarily mean that a lot of the moves that they made during that period of time were badly conceived. Remember, the crisis for Peloton in 2020 was that people were showing up wanting to buy the bikes and wanting to buy the treadmills, and it was a six-month wait. When you're looking at a company like Peloton, yes, it has been mismanaged in some way. It has not hurt the brand at all. John Foley was not ever one of my favorite CEOs, but I do give him credit for recognizing, at least partially, that he needs to have professional management making decisions at the company. The company that I look at as the proxy for what Peloton is doing is Chipotle, when Steven Ells kicked himself out of the day-to-day running of the company. I think we can say with 100% confidence, that has worked out spectacularly.
Chris Hill: It really has, even though at the time, there were some eyebrows raised at the idea that Brian Niccol, who made his bones at Taco Bell, was being brought in to run the place [laughs] that was touting itself as ""food with integrity.""
Bill Mann: [laughs] It's so funny. I was like, ""Have you had Taco Bell? Are you aware of the fact that that is only Mexican food by the thinnest of margins, and that it basically comes in Mexican food shape?"" But Brian Niccol, at a very minimum, knew exactly what it took to take a fast-food or fast-casual restaurant and make it as efficient as possible without harming the experience, such as it is. I mean, nobody is walking into Taco Bell going, ""I'm about to have the best Mexican meal of my entire life."" That's not the conversation you are having with yourself. But Brian Niccol made that company much more efficient -- as he's done with Chipotle -- without harming the experience, such as it is, for consumers.
Chris Hill: I want to go back to the brand for a second, because Chipotle's brand was harmed by those health scares. Perfectly understandable that people would not really trust the experience of going to a Chipotle after numerous health scares. It wasn't a one-time thing. That brand was hurt. It needed repairing. Brian Niccol and his team have done a great job of doing that. Peloton, as best I can tell, that brand does not seem to be harmed. I get that maybe the reputation of the business among people on Wall Street isn't as shiny as it once was. But in terms of people who use the product, I don't think there's any damage there, is there?
Bill Mann: No, and think about this. Peloton actually, on some levels, went through a crisis that was much greater than what happened at Chipotle, when they had a death -- a child ended up underneath one of their treadmills. And companies go through crises. They just do. I don't want to belittle what happened in that situation. But I think that you can say that Peloton has been resilient to a couple of potentially harmful events for their brand. It even includes fake events like Mr. Big from ""Sex and the City"" having a heart attack on a Peloton bike. They have dealt with certain things that would be impactful to a weaker brand, and to me, this shows that there is real value at Peloton that is extractable. Hopefully, Mr. McCarthy will get after it.
Chris Hill: Let's move on to Nvidia. We talked on yesterday's show about mergers and acquisitions. I don't know if I said this yesterday, but sometimes acquisitions don't work out. Sometimes you have to walk away from them, and that's exactly what Nvidia has done. It is no longer buying Arm in what would've been the biggest chip deal ever. Nvidia says there are significant regulatory challenges to the deal, so they are walking away from that. They are paying a breakup fee of $1.25 billion. But it's Nvidia, they have the money. [laughs] It's not like you or I went out and got a parking ticket, ""Oh my God, $1.25 billion, where am I going to get the money for this?"" Nvidia can pay that.
Bill Mann: It seems a little unfair though, doesn't it? I don't think it's their fault. The terms of a breakup fee tend to be pretty ruthless and pretty direct, if for any reason. But in this case, I don't know about you, but to me, it's been clear for months that this wasn't going to happen, and it has nothing to do with Nvidia's willingness to make the deal happen.
Chris Hill: This is a thought I had when I was reading over this story this morning, because you're not the first person I've heard say that today. When I was watching CNBC, I think David Faber made a similar comment. As an Nvidia shareholder, here's my question: Why wasn't it apparent to Nvidia? Why wasn't it clear when they were thinking about making this acquisition? Part of it is I'm unclear on the regulatory process. I don't know if they can go to regulators and say, ""Hey, we're thinking about buying Arm, are you guys going to be cool with that?"" [laughs] That probably isn't happening. But why did it get to the point where, pretty soon after the deal is announced, a lot of people like you are looking at this and saying, ""This isn't going to happen.""
Bill Mann: When they announced the takeover back in late 2020, there was a huge amount of fanfare. I think in some cases, companies are really trying to create their own momentum behind moves that they want to make. But almost immediately, the business secretary of the United Kingdom, Ed Miliband, came out deeply opposed to the deal. They knew that there was going to be regulatory scrutiny. Some of the licensees to the architecture of Arm came out opposed to the deal. Competitors came out opposed. I think they always knew that it was going to be a hard thing to do. I think because Arm was owned already by a Japanese company, they were hoping that an American company coming in to buy it, even though it was going to be integrating it, was not going to be a bridge too far. It turns out to have been the case. It may well be though, Chris, that some of it has to do with what you see as an increasing nervousness around big tech in general that has only increased from 2020 to today. That may be a part of it too.
Chris Hill: Do you think Nvidia starts to look for other acquisitions in the same category, albeit smaller ones, or is this a situation where the signal from regulators is clear enough that they need to invest their capital in other ways?
Bill Mann: I love that question. I don't even know what a good proxy for Arm would be. Arm is a very special company. You could say Qualcomm, perhaps. I'm just throwing names out there. Bill Mann says that Nvidia is going to buy Qualcomm. No, I don't really know what would be a good proxy for Arm Holdings. That actually is probably at least partially why there was so much sensitivity around a potential merger from a company like Nvidia.
Chris Hill: What about Peloton? Do you think they'd want to get into [inaudible]?
Bill Mann: I think Peloton would like to buy Arm Holdings. Yeah, sure. I think that's a good shout. Really, what I think is going to happen is that Chipotle is going to buy Arm Holdings, and the merger between burritos and chip architecture is going to be huge.
Chris Hill: Let's close with the Academy Award nominations, which came out this morning. I was very quickly reminded of investing because Steven Spielberg has been nominated for best director for ""West Side Story."" He's now been nominated for best director in six different decades, [laughs] which brought to mind the phrase we hear in investing all the time: Past performance is not indicative of future results. [laughs] I just thought, well, sometimes it is. I think in the case of an artist like Steven Spielberg, I think past performance is a wonderful indicator of future results, and I think for some of the companies that we talk about, and some of the companies that we hold up as great examples of being multi-decade winners, it's like -- Apple, Microsoft, are they going to post double-digit returns from now until the end of time? No, but I don't know, they're pretty good. Past performance, it's often a good indicator of future results.
Bill Mann: Right. It's like, ""indicative"" -- I don't think that word means what you think it means, [laughs] because yes, it absolutely, positively does not mean that things will happen, but it's a pretty good way to bet. That's the David Gardner process in a nutshell, is that companies that have done well, and that have been managed well in the past tend to continue to be managed well and do really good things. That's what gave him the confidence to hold an Amazon through thick and thin for 25 years. That is, truly ... would we call Steven Spielberg the Amazon of directors at this point? Is he the Amazon of directors?
Chris Hill: I think Amazon would like to be the Steven Spielberg of companies. Just if we're going by, how long is your track record? His track record starts in the 1970s.
Bill Mann: That guy's going to be something someday.
Chris Hill: Bill Mann, great talking to you. Thanks for being here.
Bill Mann: Thanks, Chris.
Chris Hill: Robert Brokamp is a certified financial planner and The Motley Fool's resident expert on retirement. Here's a fun fact, especially if you're new to the show. His nickname is Bro. If someone is saying the word ""bro"" a lot, they're not trying to be hip, they're just calling Robert by his nickname. Here to talk with Bro about how you can better discuss money with that special someone in your life is Alison Southwick.
Alison Southwick: This Valentine's Day is going to be special. Picture it: You're at a fancy restaurant, there's a string quartet playing in the corner, a server in tails pours you a glass from the third-least-expensive bottle of wine on the menu. As you gaze across the table at each other lovingly, the candlelight flickers in your eyes. You've thought of every detail, and now is the moment. You reach for their hand and whisper the words you know you should say more often, ""We need to talk about required minimum distributions.""
Wait, what? Yes. This Valentine's Day, the most romantic thing you can do with your partner is talk about money, or as Bro likes to call it, and make it weird, ""make financial whoopee.""
Robert Brokamp: Well, that term whoopee, by the way, was chosen for a particular reason, which we'll get to later in the show. But for now, here's what you need to know. How you handle money as a couple will have a significant impact on the quality of your relationship. A few years ago, I got a graduate certificate in financial therapy from Kansas State, and read a ton about the nexus of love and money. One thing I read was ""Revisiting Financial Issues and Marriage"" by Dr. Jeffrey Dew at Utah State University. It's an overview of the many studies that have looked at finance and romance. I'm just going to bring up a few excerpts -- four, in fact.
No. 1: One study found that sound financial management behaviors, things like budgeting, saving, maintaining insurance were positively associated with relationship happiness, even after controlling for the participants' financial well-being.
No. 2: In a study of long-term couples who felt that they had ""great marriages,"" the couples said that having little to no debt and living within their means contributed to their successful and happy marriages.
No. 3: We've all heard that money problems are the No. 1 cause of divorce. The evidence behind that claim was actually rather mixed. Some studies confirm it, others find that other issues are actually bigger causes of divorce. But the frequency of financial arguments were linked to the likelihood of future divorce in many studies. For example, in one, disagreement over finances on an almost daily basis had a predicted increase of 69% in the chance of divorce.
And then No. 4: Finally, one study found that having shared financial goals and values predicted relationship satisfaction even better than the couples' reports of good communication. Here's the money quote, so to speak, from Dr. Dew. ""These studies suggest that spouses need to jointly determine their financial goals and the means through which they will meet these goals.""
Alison Southwick: We could call it a financial summit or a financial State of the Union address, but that makes it sound pretty cold and calculated. Whereas money is actually anything but. That's because when we think we're talking about money with our partners, we're also talking about our personal history, possible trauma, and all the other emotions wrapped up in money.
Robert Brokamp: As any psychologist will tell you, arguments about money are usually not really about money, but about what money represents. Things like control, status, self-worth, fairness, security, even anxiety. For example, one study found that if spouses argue about whether to combine their finances, they may actually be arguing about issues related to trust and autonomy. What money really represents to each of us, as you might expect, can be traced back to how we were raised and maybe some experiences we had when we were growing up. These meanings of money, so to speak, really could cause issues between couples, partially because they are often subconscious. We don't really know they are affecting our behaviors and attitudes, but they are, and they are often not aligned with those of our partner. I think it's funny that one study found that when it comes to money, opposites attract. The study is entitled ""Fatal Fiscal Attraction: Spendthrifts and Tightwads in Marriage,"" and according to the authors, people are more likely to marry someone with different attitudes when it comes to spending, which actually can have some benefits. I think about my wife, who has occasionally pushed me to spend more than I normally would on things like vacations, and I'm grateful she did it. But as you might expect, the evidence shows that spouses with big differences in spending habits are more likely to argue and less likely to be happy.
Alison Southwick: I can speak from personal experience about how you were raised can result in having different attitudes on money. I know that my husband and I generally are on the same page about money, but I come from a family of gift-givers, and that is part of our love language, and he does not. Christmas and my birthday can usually be some interesting times in our house because he's like, ""All I have to do is just spend a ton of money on you and you don't even care,"" and then I'm like, ""Well, I mean, kind of a little."" Because in my family, that's how you show someone that you actually value them and care about them. We get by. How about you, Bro?
Robert Brokamp: I will say my wife is the same way, and it really comes from a place where she did not have great Christmases and birthdays growing up, so she wants to give something to our kids that she didn't have. So, similar I suppose. But for me, I know that my attitude about money, especially as a spouse and father, is influenced by experiences I had as a kid. I had a very happy childhood, very grateful to my parents, but money was an issue. Then when I was a teenager, my dad's business went under, and for about a year things were pretty dicey. Things like cars getting repossessed, utilities getting turned off, my dad going out the back door because there were creditors at the front door, and then within a year or two, my parents were divorced. I remember thinking back then, ""If I ever get married and have kids, I'm not going to let this happen."" It really has influenced why I am actually pretty anxious about money and why I take it very seriously.
Alison Southwick: That's why it's important to have these conversations and understand that when you're talking about money, you're not just talking about money. Of course, we aren't suggesting that you pull up Excel tables and a PowerPoint presentation for your partner in between the second and third course, but we are suggesting that you start with an exercise we call The Fooly-Wed Game. It's only 10 questions, and there are also 10 rules. We'll give you a brief overview here, but you want to Google it for the whole thing. Bro, briefly describe the history of The Fooly-Wed Game.
Robert Brokamp: Well, it's a play on the old ""Newlywed Game."" It's a game show that first aired in 1966 and lasted for decades. By the way, legend has it that when the show started, you couldn't say ""sex"" on TV. They used the term ""making whoopee,"" which is where that term comes from. It's pretty much been associated with the show to this very day. Now, as for The Fooly-Wed Game, it was created in the early 2000s, still available on fool.com. Just do an online search for it, and here's how it works. Each partner answers 10 money-related questions, individually, but then, the couple gets together to compare their answers. It could also be interesting to try to predict what your partner's responses will be to see how well you know her or his attitudes about money.
Alison Southwick: So, 10 questions, we won't cover them all, but Bro, what are some of your favorites?
Robert Brokamp: Well, I will say one is, you place a list of items in the order of importance, and we're talking about things like retirement and college savings as well as clothes and entertainment. It's a good way to see how much your goals are aligned. Another question asks, ""How much is too much to spend without consulting your partner?"" I think this question is important because different attitudes on spending is one of the key causes of conflict in couples. But it's also not just that level of spending, but whether one or both spouses are hiding it. This touches on something known as financial infidelity, which is a whole other topic, but suffice it to say it's better to know upfront how much your partner thinks is OK to spend without checking in. Then a third one is, ""What are the three best purchases you've made as a couple, and what are the three worst?"" These purchases could be things you bought on Amazon, buying a house, or even buying certain investments. Answering the question is another way to see how well you're aligned, but it's also a way to identify what you've done well and ideally maybe should do more of, and then what past mistakes you'd like to avoid.
Alison Southwick: Some of these questions are a bit more cut and dry, but some of them are pretty creative and fun. Like we said, 10 questions, but there are also some ground rules. The ground rules are perhaps even more important, because they are good rules for any financial chat you're having with your partner. Bro, what are some of your favorite ground rules?
Robert Brokamp: I would say the two that are most important are related, and that is, one is, accept equal responsibility for changing your lives around. Studies indicate that when it comes to household finances, there's usually one person who's doing more of the financial work, but that doesn't mean it should be their total responsibility. You have to both accept responsibility for improving your finances. Then another one is, don't play the blame game. These discussions will almost always result in reviewing things that went on in the past that were not ideal, and that's good. You should identify things -- mistakes that you've made, things you want to turn around. But you can't keep bringing those up. At some point, you have to say, ""All right, what happened in the past is the past. Today, we're starting out completely fresh and new, and looking forward.""
Alison Southwick: It's possible your Fooly-Wed Game financial summit was harmonious and ended with dancing in the field of flowers. But it's more likely you discovered something new about your partner, or some new topics where you aren't aligned, or even areas where you flat out disagree. Next week, we're going to cover the most common money conflicts in relationships and some of the initial steps you can take to solving them together. Don't worry, you swinging singles out there, we have an episode for you coming as well. Bro, any final words of advice for our Fooly-Wed Game players?
Robert Brokamp: First of all, if I were to update The Fooly-Wed Game -- and it is more than 20 years old now -- I'd include a question about the financial logistics of managing money as a couple, things like, who pays the bills, who handles the investments, who's going to find a lawyer so you finally get an estate plan, and ask whether both people are happy with their respective jobs, because like any chore related to running a household, you want to make sure important stuff gets done and that the workload is shared equally. Then finally, I'll just say if you play The Fooly-Wed Game or you just have a thorough or honest discussion about money in general, there could be three possible outcomes. No. 1, you're perfectly compatible and everything's awesome, good job. No. 2, you discover a few key differences which then leads to productive conversation and puts you on a better path, also a good job. But No. 3 is this could really uncover significant problems that you have trouble resolving. This whole Fooly-Wed Game could end up in, frankly, a big argument, and you're not sure what to do about it. We are going to talk on next Tuesday's show about how to resolve some of the biggest financial issues between partners.
But for now, I'm going to suggest one thing and that is you consider getting professional help, and the type of help really depends on the problems. There are almost cut and dried answers to some financial disagreements. For example, if you want to retire at age 65, there is an amount of money you should be saving. It might be that you just need to see a fee-only financial planner and get that objective, expert opinion to help you resolve your disagreements. It could also be that you need to see a financial therapist -- and such a profession does exist. It's relatively new, but you can go to the website of the Financial Therapy Association and see if there's someone in your area that has experience helping couples resolve their financial differences, or you could just see a regular couples counselor. If money issues are an ongoing source of marital discord, paying for professional help could be one of the best investments you'll ever make.

2022-03-02 00:00:00+00:00,10 Billion Reasons to Buy Intel Stock,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/10-billion-reasons-to-buy-intel-stock,"Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) 2022 investors meeting, which was held on Feb. 17, provided a lot of insight into the chip giant's plans in different areas of its business. But it was the accelerated computing systems and graphics business that revealed the company's plans to take the fight to two of its biggest rivals -- Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.
The accelerated computing systems and graphics group, or AXG, could become a huge growth driver for Intel. This business segment is unlike the client computing group (CCG) or the data center group (DCG), where Intel already enjoys a dominant position.
Intel is a greenhorn in the discrete graphics processing unit (GPU) space, which is currently dominated by AMD and Nvidia, but it believes that it could take a sizable chunk out of this market in the next five years. Let's see how AXG could supercharge Intel stock in the long run.

Intel sees solid growth in graphics cards
Intel is forecasting $1 billion in revenue from the AXG business this year, which would be a small fraction of the company's estimated 2022 revenue of $76 billion. Intel expects AXG revenue to increase to an annual run rate of $10 billion by 2026, as it is targeting several fast-growing opportunities within this market.
For instance, Intel expects to ship 4 million units of its consumer-grade Alchemist GPUs in 2022. Intel's discrete GPUs have already landed more than 50 design wins across several original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Acer, Asus, Samsung, Dell, MSI, HP, Lenovo, and others. Chipzilla will start rolling out its discrete GPUs this quarter in notebooks, followed by desktop-compatible graphics cards in the second quarter, and workstation-specific cards in the third quarter.
If Intel hits its annual shipment target, it could carve out a nice chunk of the discrete GPU market in 2022. That's because 42 million discrete graphics cards were sold in 2020, according to Jon Peddie Research, followed by 37 million units in the first nine months of 2021. Intel's 4 million target indicates that the chipmaker is looking to corner 10% of this lucrative space this year.
That would be great news for investors, as the discrete GPU market could hit $54 billion in revenue by 2025, according to Jon Peddie Research. Nvidia is the dominant player in this space with a market share of 81%. AMD controls the rest of the discrete GPU market. Intel can now provide consumers with a viable third alternative, which would be a good thing for gaming enthusiasts, as its Alchemist cards will come equipped with ray tracing and resolution upscaling technology.
So Intel could chip away at Nvidia and AMD's discrete GPU market share this year and set the stage for further growth in this segment with the launch of future generations of graphics cards in 2023 and 2024. Assuming Intel does manage to score 10% of the discrete GPU market by 2025, it could generate at least $5 billion in revenue from this space based on Jon Peddie Research's forecast.
This, however, is not the only catalyst that could drive Intel's AXG business.
Chipzilla is aiming for another huge vertical
Intel claims that more than 85% of the supercomputers in the world are powered by its Xeon server processors. The company plans to use its robust position in this market to introduce data center GPUs that will be capable of tackling high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.
Chipzilla is already anticipating 35 design wins from OEMs and cloud service providers for its accelerated computing solutions for the data center market. Intel says that its Ponte Vecchio data center GPU is 2.6 times more powerful than the competition's ""leading market solution on a complex financial services workload."" The Aurora supercomputer at the Argonne National Laboratory -- a research center of the U.S. Department of Energy -- will be using six of Intel's Ponte Vecchio GPUs later in 2022.
It is worth noting that the Ponte Vecchio is capable of exascale computing, which will allow it to tap into a market that's expected to hit $7.7 billion in revenue by 2026, according to a third-party estimate. Meanwhile, the overall data center GPU market is estimated to hit nearly $21 billion in value by 2026, which means that the chip giant could tap into a much bigger opportunity over here.
As a result, it wouldn't be surprising to see Intel's AXG business generate $10 billion in annual revenue after five years -- those dollars represent plenty of reason to buy shares today. However, investors shouldn't rule out the possibility of this segment generating more revenue than Intel's expects, as the company's roadmap indicates that it is planning to launch an integrated data center CPU (central processing unit) and GPU architecture in 2024, known as Falcon Shores.
Intel says that the Falcon Shores architecture can ""deliver benefits of more than 5x performance-per-watt, 5x compute density, 5x memory capacity and bandwidth improvements."" This could unlock a solid opportunity for Intel, as the adoption of single-socket servers is expected to increase in the long run, and Chipzilla could bring a ground-breaking product by integrating both the CPU and the GPU into a single architecture.
Currently, the data center GPU market is dominated by Nvidia, with a more-than-80% share. AMD controls 10.7% of the data center CPU market and Intel commands the rest, indicating that the latter could hurt both its rivals with an integrated chip. So Intel could win big from the accelerating computing and graphics market in the long run, giving investors another reason to bet on this semiconductor stock that's gunning for a turnaround.

2022-03-04 00:00:00+00:00,Should Invesco Dynamic Large Cap Growth ETF (PWB) Be on Your Investing Radar?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-invesco-dynamic-large-cap-growth-etf-pwb-be-on-your-investing-radar-0,"The Invesco Dynamic Large Cap Growth ETF (PWB) was launched on 03/03/2005, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.
The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $682.98 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.
Why Large Cap Growth
Companies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.
Qualities of growth stocks include faster growth rates compared to the broader market, as well as higher valuations and higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. Also, growth stocks are a type of equity that carries more risk compared to others. When you consider growth versus value, growth stocks are usually the clear winner in strong bull markets but tend to fall flat in nearly all other environments.
Costs
Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.56%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.04%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
It is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 37.90% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Telecom round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Tesla Inc (TSLA) accounts for about 5.14% of total assets, followed by Nvidia Corp (NVDA) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 36.41% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
PWB seeks to match the performance of the Dynamic Large Cap Growth Intellidex Index before fees and expenses. The Dynamic Large Cap Growth Intellidex Index is designed to provide capital appreciation while maintaining consistent stylistically accurate exposure.
The ETF has lost about -15% so far this year and is up roughly 3.85% in the last one year (as of 03/04/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $63.11 and $82.12.
The ETF has a beta of 0.95 and standard deviation of 24.69% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 51 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
Invesco Dynamic Large Cap Growth ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, PWB is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Growth segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.
The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) and the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) track a similar index. While Vanguard Growth ETF has $77.03 billion in assets, Invesco QQQ has $179.45 billion. VUG has an expense ratio of 0.04% and QQQ charges 0.20%.
Bottom-Line
Passively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.

2022-03-08 00:00:00+00:00,Bear Of The Day: Wayfair (W),NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bear-of-the-day%3A-wayfair-w,"E-commerce platforms have exploded since the pandemic locked the world down and sent consumers online. Wayfair W, a leading digital platform for purchasing furniture and home décor, has been one such beneficiary of COVID-19 with an over 1,600% share price surge from its pandemic lows last March to its all-time high in mid-January 2021.
W is now traded over -50% off its November highs, and is currently valued at nearly 1/3rd of the highs it reached last January.
It's time to pull out of this COVID winner, as society's online-driven home improvement binge decelerates.
Analysts have lowered their EPS estimates for the next couple of years, reining in their initial overzealous projections, pushing W into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Let me be clear here, I am not suggesting that you short sell this stock, but if you are a current stockholder, it may be a smart move to take pull your capital here for higher return potential elsewhere. 
W has lost more than half its value in the volatility amid the volatility we’ve seen in the past 3 months, and it looks like this falling knife could go even lower as analysts continue to downgrade this equity and pull-down EPS estimates as its bottom-line slides back into negative territory in recent quarters with increasing depth.
The Business & My Concerns
Like what we’ve seen in the past 3 quarterly reports, prior to 2020, the company was experiencing continuously deeper bottom-line deficits the larger its sales grew (for 5 years), pointing to some systemic issues with the business's ability to scale. 
2020 was Wayfair's golden year, and you can see this in both its financials and stock price. Its net income flipped from a deficit of $(982) million in 2019 to a robust profit of $242 million in 2020. My concern is that this profitability isn't sustainable in the post-pandemic world, which is progressive proving to be true as its profitable growth path reverted in 2021. 
During the lockdown, people were spending way too much time in their homes, which catalyzed this desire to redecorate and engage in do-it-yourself (DIY) home projects. There has been a boom in spending on furniture and home goods, and Wayfair's ecommerce platform was perfectly positioned to capture this demand from quarantined customers. 
The thing about furniture and housing décor is that many people want to see it in person before dropping a sizable amount of money on a new couch, patio furniture, etc. The argument can be made that customers have become conditioned to purchase things off Wayfair instead of going to their local furniture store. However, the fact of the matter is that even if this is true, people will still not be spending as much money on these items when the economy opens up. Consumers will be pivoting their budgets away from decorative pillows and towards things like travel and restaurants. 
I am worried that this company will not be able to maintain its profitability in the post-pandemic world, and even if they do, it will not see the same growth rates that it saw amid the lockdowns. 
Final Thoughts 
W currently has 4 sell ratings on it, which is a red flag because sell ratings are not handed out nearly as often as buy/hold ratings (considering that the stock market, on average, always goes up). Wayfair is also sporting an over 210% debt-to-total capital ratio as it leverages its operations to the gills, pushing shareholders' equity deep into negative territory, another big red flag.
If the company is unable to regain its prior profitable growth outlay, it may be in real trouble. Again, I am not recommending that you short this stock. Just consider reallocating the capital to a more topical investment such as NVIDIA NVDA, my Bull Of The Day.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock jumped out of the gate Wednesday morning, and shares of the semiconductors powerhouse are up 5.6% as of 10 a.m. ET.
What's causing Nvidia stock to rise? A confluence of factors may actually be at work.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
For one thing, stock markets generally are ""in the green"" as of the same time this morning, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 2% and the Nasdaq Composite up 2.7%. Rising tides tend to lift all boats, and Nvidia stock is certainly benefiting from investor optimism today.
More specific to the company itself, Nvidia announced last night that it will hold an investor day beginning at 1 p.m. ET on March 22. No details on what will be discussed in this presentation, but it's being timed to coincide with the company's virtual Graphics Technology Conference (GTC 2022), at which the company's vice president of developer programs, Greg Estes, promised to deliver ""a mother lode of content."" Presumably, the investor day will discuss how all this news affects the business.
Now what
Last but not least, Axios is reporting that in order to win ""the technology race with China,"" congressional Democrats are calling for -- and the president is supporting -- new legislation ""to turbocharge manufacturing in crucial industries and make America less susceptible to outside shocks.""
Semiconductors are a focal point of this effort, and Axios notes that there's the potential for Congress ""to pass a $150 billion to $350 billion bill to turbocharge the domestic semiconductor industry."" The aim of these subsidies would be to accelerate the building of new semiconductor production capacity here in the U.S., to reduce reliance on imported chips.
While there's no guarantee this bill will be passed, and no certainty about how much of the contemplated subsidies will go to Nvidia, on balance investors are taking this news as another plus for Nvidia stock today.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock cost 5.4% more when trading opened on Mar. 9 than the previous open on Mar. 8.
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
The rally had little to do with the company’s growth prospects, which remain excellent. The acquisition of Xilinx means bigger profits are ahead. Additionally, Wall Street still loves Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Lisa Su.
What we’re seeing, instead, is another example of Wall Street’s perverse nature. It always looks ahead. It buys the rumor and sells the news.
AMD Strengths
AMD is down by nearly one-third since Nov. 29. Even its 3% gain in overnight trading leaves it below $109 per share. It had peaked at nearly $162 in November. The market cap is now $169 billion on 2021 sales of $16.4 billion. The price to earnings ratio is 40.49. Even at its depressed price, AMD stock is not cheap.
8 Strong Uptrend Stocks to Buy on the Next Dip
Why, then, are so many buying the dip? AMD’s 2021 revenue came in at $16.4 billion. With Xilinx added, 2021 revenue is closer to $20 billion. AMD designs continue to lead those of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the microprocessor space. It is the biggest competitor to Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in graphics. AMD may be second here, but it can still win big contracts in gaming, as well as cloud data centers.  It is Intel that is now stuck with the low-end markets AMD is abandoning, not the other way around.
Su says the chip shortage won’t end in 2022, meaning prices will remain firm. That is a reversal from her position last September.
AMD is a chip designer, so it doesn’t have the capital requirements of Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), which is its primary supplier. That means it ended 2021 with $3.6 billion in cash on the books and just $350 million in long-term debt. Operating cash flow more than tripled last year to $3.5 billion and will rise further this year. Analysts expect another march toward that all-time high.
AMD Weaknesses
While there are strengths, there are also reasons for caution.
AMD stock is more volatile than Intel. While AMD’s market cap briefly topped Intel’s recently, Intel has been outperforming it in 2022, down 9.9% year-to-date against 14% for AMD. That is because AMD remains just one quarter the size of Intel, even with Xilinx’s sales added in.
Geopolitical risk is also greater with AMD stock. Should Ukraine collapse and China make a move against Taiwan, home of its chip supplier (and Su’s birthplace), Intel will be a better stock to be in. Intel would be the primary beneficiary of the billions in aid President Joe Biden’s administration wants to gift the industry. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger was even at the State of the Union address. Additionally, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion on Ukraine has helped the bill move forward.
Taiwan Semiconductor is also building new fabs, so it is possible that the current shortage ends in 2024. The current buying cycle has lasted so long that many forget semiconductors can be as much of a boom-and-bust business as oil.
The Bottom Line on AMD Stock
Like everyone else, I’ve lost a lot of money on my semiconductor investments lately.
What is happening right now is that fundamentals are re-asserting themselves ahead of geopolitics. Those indicate smooth sailing for AMD over the next few years.
But the shocks could return. Even if they don’t, fundamentals indicate that the current shortage will end. That will mean an end to AMD’s excessive profits. AMD has been bringing over 20% of revenue to the net income line. But it was just three years ago that it was bringing just 5% of revenue to net income. In 2017, it lost money.
AMD was one of the great stocks of the last decade, but now it is a giant. Giants move more slowly.

Down around 25% year-to-date, 2022 has been a frustrating year for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) investors. Many factors have put pressure on the price of NVDA stock.
Source: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.com
I’m sure you’re aware of the external factors bearing down on Nvidia. Inflation, interest rates and now the Russia-Ukraine war have caused tech stocks to tank.
The Russia situation has technically caused tech stocks to enter bear market territory. If that’s not bad enough, the chip giant has had to deal with a few hiccups as well. This has happened all while the broader tech selloff has been going on.
As you likely recall, the company had to scrap its deal to buy Arm due to regulatory issues. It also had to deal with a cyberattack. Although this hacking incident is small potatoes in the grand scheme of things, it certainly didn’t do it any favors, as bullishness for shares continues to drop off.
However, while things haven’t been going Nvidia’s way, there’s no need to bail. In fact, after its recent weakness, now may be the right time to enter/add to a position. Long-term tailwinds will more than make up for the many headwinds that have knocked it lower in recent months.
What’s On The Horizon for NVDA Stock?
Recent company-specific issues (scrapping Arm deal, cyberattack) may now be fully absorbed by the market. Yet the external factors that have affected its performance could continue to do so.
In the short-term, the direction tech stocks move from here will largely dictate the next direction for NVDA stock. If investors realize that they have overreacted to the aforementioned uncertainties? We could see shares, alongside shares in other major Nasdaq 100 components, continue to bounce back, as they’ve been doing in recent days.

Conversely, if more bad news, whether on geopolitics, inflation or interest rates, comes about, then further weakness may lie ahead. However, focusing on the near term isn’t the best approach with Nvidia stock. The beauty of it is with its potential to steadily compound over time. Not attempting to profit from trading around it.
That is, while the near-term is tough to handicap, there’s still a fairly clear picture of where this company is going from here. Leveling up after its strong operating performance throughout the pandemic, the years ahead stand to bring more of the solid revenue and earnings growth we’ve seen over the two preceding fiscal years.
Keep Your Focus on the Long Term
Market conditions may have changed, and could continue to change. But the trends that fueled the incredible run of NVDA stock in 2020 and 2021 aren’t going away. Demand for its GPUs among end users in cloud computing, video gaming and other sectors remains robust.
New markets are enabling parts of the company to report exceptionally high rates of growth. Last quarter, when it reported 53% overall revenue growth year-over-year, its data center unit reported revenue growth of 71%. This was driven by increased use of graphics processors in order to run artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Another emerging segment, Professional Visualization, reported annual sales growth of 109%.
Other promising growth areas, like automotive, may be on hold for now, due to the supply shocks. Yet once these supply shocks resolve, this is another area that could help enable Nvidia to keep expanding at an above-average pace. This fiscal year (ending January 2023), the sell-side estimates the company’s top line will grow 29%.
Earnings-per-share (EPS) of around $5.61 per share are projected to come in around 26.4% above 2021’s EPS number ($4.44). As this plays out, and the company continues to thrive, despite fears that the pandemic “pulled forward” many years worth of growth, the stock will gradually make a recovery. That’s especially true given that it’s at around $225 per share today (down from as much as $346.47 last year). NVDA stock has plenty of room to chart a comeback.
The Verdict on NVDA Stock
Cashing out of Nvidia today may result in you leaving money on the table. Nvidia has an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader. Its decline over the past four months is more the product of short-term volatility, rather than a sign that it’s the beginning of the end for this stock’s incredible multi-year run.
For those still sitting on the sidelines? The knockdown to Nvidia’s stock price gives you the opportunity to enter a position at a favorable price. Its troubles will pass, but the factors that have, and will continue to, enable it to report above-average rates of growth for years to come are here to stay.
Furthermore, as I recently commented when breaking down the case for Nvidia:
“NVDA has 43.4% annual forecasted revenue growth and 41.8% annual earnings growth. The analyst community has revised their consensus earnings estimate up 10.3% higher for NVDA in the past month. The war & hacking will not disrupt NVDA, which dominate graphics chips and AI chips. Nvidia is a monopoly and a very safe investment.”
With the negatives overly reflected in the price of NVDA stock, and the positives not reflected enough, it’s a buy.

2022-03-14 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Dropped Again Today,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-dropped-again-today-3,"What happened
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) dropped in Monday trading, falling by 4.1% through 2:15 p.m. ET in response to continuing despondent news about the state of the semiconductor industry.
Reuters reported over the weekend that the ongoing conflict in Ukraine will almost certainly disrupt supplies of neon gas, which is vital for the manufacture of semiconductor chips. That sounds like it should be good news for Nvidia because if there are continued constraints on semiconductor supplies, that should push prices -- and profit margins -- higher. On the other hand, if input costs rise for Nvidia, that would squeeze its profit margins.

So what
Adding to Nvidia's troubles, on Monday morning, Citigroup released a report warning of ""incredibly bearish"" sentiment regarding semiconductor stocks. Investors, the bank warns, are beginning to wonder if a Chinese attack on Taiwan might be imminent -- and what would happen if such an event were to cut off companies like Nvidia from their contract manufacturers on the island.
Nvidia depends on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) to produce fully 50% of the chips it sells, warned Citi in its note, which was covered by StreetInsider.com. And even if the risk of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan in the near future is remote (we hope), the chance of it happening is still not zero.
Now what
Accordingly, investors need to factor that possibility into their calculations of how risky an investment in Nvidia really is. Citi thinks this is what investors have been doing as they've sold off Nvidia stock over the past three months. The bank further warns that there's ""a belief"" forming that ""a recession [is] coming due to increasing inflation, the slowing Chinese economy, and economic impacts of the Russia/Ukraine conflict.""
Should that come to pass -- even in the absence of a doomsday Taiwan scenario -- demand for semiconductors could slacken, quickly transforming what has been a global semiconductor deficit over the past two years into a surplus. Indeed, Citi already sees hints of a trend that point toward ""a PC slowdown"" in the second half of this year."" That could depress demand for chips.
Fact is, Citi cites so many worries about what could go wrong for semiconductor companies like Nvidia that it's hard to say which specific one worries it most. One thing is clear, though: The higher the valuation of Nvidia stock (and at 63 times earnings, it's already fairly highly valued), the bigger those worries will become.

2022-03-15 00:00:00+00:00,7 Superstar Tech Stocks That May Outperform This Market Rout,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-superstar-tech-stocks-that-may-outperform-this-market-rout,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Investing in tech stocks, superstar or not, in recent years has been a solid strategy. Most growth-oriented technology companies have seen their valuations balloon, even during the pandemic. With expectations that interest rates could stay lower for longer, with inflation remaining subdued, there was a lot to like about the deflationary thesis underpinning so many of these names.
However, alongside the incredible monetary stimulus and supply chain issues stemming from the pandemic has come inflation. With the highest inflation in approximately four decades now upon us, central banks everywhere are scrambling to hike rates. These interest rate hikes have the potential to reduce the valuation investors are willing to pay for growth stocks. In fact, most growth stocks have seen a marked decline in interest of late for this key reason.
However, the question is whether investors should take such an alarmist view of growth stocks right now. During previous hiking cycles, many growth stocks did well. Outside of the dot-com bubble, which saw many companies reach ridiculous valuations on the basis of relatively weak business models, most hiking environments have represented periods of otherwise strong growth.

Tech Stocks to Buy: Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.com
Rising almost 150%, Nvidia was a key beneficiary of the bull market we saw last year. This computer chip manufacturing giant specializes in the production of graphics processing units (GPUs). Last year, Nvidia overtook its competitors, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), to become the industry leader.
Given its outperformance, NVDA is now in correction mode, falling more than 29% on a year-to-date basis at the time of writing. This stock’s downward trend is the result of a number of factors, including a recent cyberattack, which led to business data being stolen. Overall, such events are very bearish, especially given the timing. It’s not a great time to be an investor in high-growth tech stocks, and such events weaken the thesis behind owning such names right now.
That said, over the long-term, expectations are that this single event won’t impact Nvidia’s growth. This company’s growth profile, as highlighted in the company’s recent fourth-quarter results on Feb. 16, show a company that’s still in hyper-growth mode. Strong demand for semiconductors has boosted this company’s revenue by 53% on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, Nvidia grew its bottom line by 69% year-over-year, signaling even stronger margins than before.
Currently, Nvidia demands a strong market position in the global GPU market. Over time, I expect this position to be strengthened by the company’s focus on the metaverse and other key growth sectors. Indeed, this is a superstar tech stock I think is worth looking at right now.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com
What’s a list of top superstar tech stocks without Apple?
The largest company in the world, with a market capitalization of $2.6 trillion at the time of writing, Apple remains a core portfolio holding of many active and passive investors. That’s because due to its size, AAPL stock is the largest holding in most diversified index exchange-traded funds. Whether investors like it or not, Apple’s performance is a key driver of the market overall, and vice versa.
Apple’s stock price has been hit hard by the same macro conditions that have beaten down the overall market of late. However, this company’s unique position in the luxury consumer discretionary category is one I think is worth considering. Unlike many of its peers, Apple has pricing power the company has wielded to protect its margins. In this time of inflation, which will continue to drive input costs higher, Apple has defended its margins (and actually grown its margins) over time. As the company shifts its revenue mix toward services, I expect this trend to continue.

Overall, Apple’s results have been impressive, and I think this company is well-positioned to continue to grow in a steady manner over the long-term. Those looking for superstar growth don’t need to think too hard — Apple is a great long-term pick, in my view.
Tech Stocks to Buy: CrowdStrike (CRWD)

In this new age of war we’ve now entered with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, greater emphasis is being placed on stocks that may benefit in this environment. Of course, there are the standard defense stocks that are outperforming right now. However, cybersecurity stocks such as CrowdStrike have not gotten the same degree of love lately.
Indeed, cybersecurity is a key growth sector that will likely continue to grow, regardless of this conflict. However, with the powerful threat coming from Russian-based hackers both in the Ukraine and abroad, this company’s offerings are even more important today.
Crowdstrike is an interesting stock in that this company is actually down considerably over the past six months. In fact, CRWD stock has lost approximately 25% of its value over this time frame, as investors have mainly focused on higher interest rates and their impact on high-growth stocks.
That said, as far as companies with the ability to accelerate earnings through this crisis go, Crowdstrike is certainly a company worth considering. For investors concerned about this conflict, CrowdStrike offers one of the most defensive growth models on the Nasdaq right now.
Concentrix (CNXC)

One of the better-performing stocks I’d put in the superstar category in tech, Concentrix is a company that has generally outpaced the market over the past year. This stock is up considerably, as clients look for customer solutions providers like Concentrix to manage their way through this uncertainty.
Like other pandemic-driven stocks, Concentrix accelerated through 2021. However, this stock has not been hit as hard by concerns around valuation, given the company’s reasonable valuation multiple of 25-times earnings (and that’s after this recent period of capital appreciation).
The company’s business model of CX optimization, business transformation, analytics and other services have grown considerably. This is mainly due to the company’s impressive positioning among its peers as a leading provider of these services.

Over the long term, investors focused on optimization plays in this economy may want to consider CNXC stock. The company’s strong Q4 results highlight why this is a top stock on my watch list right now.
Tech Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN)

Another absolute tech behemoth, Amazon is a company most investors have to put on their superstar list. This company has felt the same macro pressures as all companies on this list. Accordingly, AMZN stock is down more than 20% from last year’s peak.
In recent years, Amazon is a stock that has trended in only one direction — up. That’s because this company is among the fastest-growing at its size. With a valuation of more than $1.5 trillion at the time of writing, Amazon still manages to grow revenue in key segments such as its AWS cloud business by 40% per year. This is the key profit center for the company, and one investors remain tuned into.
The company’s recent fourth-quarter results provided a strong thesis for long-term growth investors to simply hold on tight. The company’s revenue grew by 9% overall, and the company’s stake in Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) provided a massive earnings beat. Additionally, the company recently announced a stock split and massive buyback, something that has retail investors excited.
I think Amazon is a company that’s got too many positive catalysts to ignore. In a flight to safety, growth investors are likely to find themselves adding AMZN. Accordingly, this stock remains a top pick of mine in the tech space.
Alphabet (GOOGL)

Shares of the parent company of the world’s largest and most used search engine, Alphabet, did not enter 2022 on a good note. However, Alphabet not only beat all Wall Street estimates, but it was another company that decided to share news of a stock split, which excited retail investors.
Like Amazon’s stock split, this move by Alphabet does not change the fundamentals of its business. One can think of a stock split as the equivalent of taking a company’s market capitalization (a pie) and cutting it into more slices. Investors own more shares (slices) of this pie, though their total percentage ownership of said company remains the same.
This move has been seen as a bullish one by investors, as it allows Alphabet to offer options to lower-income employees, as well as allow for employees to sell off a portion of their holdings without impacting the company’s share price significantly.
Of course, this news overshadowed otherwise strong Q4 results which further the long-term thesis on this stock.

Overall, I remain bullish on Alphabet as a long-term winner in the U.S. search market. Those looking for a place to hide right now have an excellent option with GOOGL stock.
Tech Stocks to Buy: Meta Platforms (FB)
Source: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com
Last, but certainly not least, we have Meta Platforms.
The parent company of social media platform Facebook, Meta is a stock that has been absolutely hammered by the market. Since its peak last year, shares of FB stock have lost more than 50% of their value, at the time of writing. That’s an incredible dip, given the pace of this company’s earnings growth of late.
Much of this recent decline can be attributed to a massive 25% drop in a single day on Feb. 3. The company impressively lost more than $200 billion in market value, marking the single largest drop in market capitalization for any stock in history.
This drop can be attributed to many factors. However, negative user growth for the company’s Facebook platform, also a first, drove most of this sentiment. Additionally, the company’s decision to pull out of Russia (for obvious reasons) has been seen as a likely driver of continued declining monthly active users in the coming quarters. Additionally, the company posted a massive loss for its metaverse division, something that has some investors concerned about where this company is banking on for future growth.
The thing is, Meta’s overall fundamentals remain strong. This company is one that I think has both a highly profitable business model and the ability to expand into verticals such as the metaverse. Time will ultimately tell how successful this strategy is. However, for now, I think this is a top-notch blue chip tech stock to buy at an incredible discount.

2022-03-16 00:00:00+00:00,"These 2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks Are Set for Strong Growth, Says Truist",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-2-artificial-intelligence-stocks-are-set-for-strong-growth-says-truist,"Let’s talk about artificial intelligence. AI is a growing segment of the tech sector, finding uses in almost every industry, especially those featuring autonomous systems. Self-driving cars, industrial robots, call center chatbots, even the smartphones in our pockets – all of them have some connection with AI and machine learning tech. It has already changed the face of the digital world, and its revolution is far from over.
A tech with such a profound and wide-ranging impact will also make itself felt in the stock markets – that much is certain. Companies will move in, to make use of AI or to produce AI, or both, and their actions will open up plenty of opportunities for investors. AI isn’t just an important new tech, it’s also a driver for new investment capital and returns.
Top analysts from investment firm Truist have found a couple of AI stocks that they believe are primed for further growth. According the TipRanks data, these are Strong Buys, with over 40% upside potential for the months ahead. Let's take a closer look.
Five9 (FIVN)
We’ll start with Five9, a tech company offering AI software on the cloud, tailored for use in the contact center niche. Five9 offers a series of AI-powered cloud software solutions for call centers in a wide range of industries, including telemarketing, financial services, customer service, healthcare, retail, and outsourcing. The company’s AI products include intelligent virtual agents, workflow automation, and interactive voice response, and reporting and analytics. Five9 boasts over 2,000 global enterprise customers, and more than 7 billion interactions annually.
In the last reported quarter, for 4Q21, Five9 reported $173.6 million at the top line, up 36% year-over-year to a company record. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS rose from 34 cents one year ago to the currently reported 42 cents, for a gain of 23%. Looking at the full year, Five9 had over $609 million in total revenues for 2021, again a company record, compared to the $434 reported in 2020. However, for 1Q22, the company said it expects to report non-GAAP profit of 12 cents to 14 cents a share, well below Wall Street consensus forecast of 21 cents.
Despite the earnings miss for this quarter, Truist’s 5-star analyst Terry Tillman believes the overall upward trajectory bodes well for the company. He writes, ""[Five9] commented that 2022 is poised for even greater international headcount. On the product side, the company noted that usage of IVAs among FIVN customers has tripled y/y, with IVA accounting for 10% of enterprise bookings in new logos in 2021. We believe the company is set to continue benefiting from its position in AI and its overall automation story along with IVA, Agent Assist, and the Workflow Automation capabilities.”
These comments back up Tillman’s Buy rating, and his $150 price target suggests that Five9 has potential gains of ~61% ahead of it. (To watch Tillman’s track record, click here)
Overall, Five9’s Strong Buy rating reflects a bullish consensus. The 18 recent analyst reviews include 16 Buys, 1 Hold, and 1 Sell; the shares are priced at $93.26 and the $150.59 average price target is practically the same as Tillman’s. (See FIVN stock forecast on TipRanks)
Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)
The second Truist recommendation we’ll look at is Nvidia. This semiconductor giant has built a solid reputation for the quality of graphics processors and memory chips that have been in high demand among both dedicated gamers and professional designers. More to the point, for this article, this top-ten chip maker’s products have found a niche in the AI industry, and the GPUs have the necessary computing capacity to power artificial intelligence tech.
That, however, is not the limit of Nvidia’s exposure to AI. The company uses the tech, too, in its own chip design and production lines. It’s a case of AI being used to build better AI – literally, on the hardware end.
Nvidia has shown 7 straight quarters to top line revenue growth, with the $7.64 billion reported in 4Q22 being up 53% year-over-year, and a company quarterly record. Fiscal year 2022 revenues were up 61% to $26.91 billion, also a company record. Earnings gains were also extreme, and the $1.32 non-GAAP EPS reported in Q4 was up 69% y/y, and 13% sequentially. The quarterly EPS was also 7% better than the forecast.
In his coverage for Truist, 5-star analyst William Stein described Nvidia as ‘*the* AI company,’ and attributes that 'partly to its high-performance GPUs that provide the necessary parallel compute capability.’ He goes on, however, to note “NVDA's culture of innovation, ecosystem of incumbency, and significant investment in AI software tools and models. This creates a moat that challenges new entrants and supports NVDA's structural growth. Its investments in other aspects of parallel compute (especially graphics) solidify its position in gaming / e-sports and professional visualization. These make NVDA a unique asset in semis: a large-cap company with structural growth characteristics, justifying a premium multiple.”
Stein’s Buy rating on NVDA stock is in line with his commentary, and his $350 price target implies a one-year upside of ~43%. (To watch Stein’s track record, click here)
Stein’s objective is virtually in-line with the Street’s average target, which currently stands at $352.65. This top stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 21 recent reviews, that include 17 Buys against 4 Holds. (See NVDA stock forecast on TipRanks)

2022-03-17 00:00:00+00:00,Is Nvidia Stock a Buy Now?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-nvidia-stock-a-buy-now-0,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is considered by some to be the world's leading semiconductor company. Its GPUs power applications in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and data centers, and its massive growth has sent the stock price to record highs. Its technical lead should help keep it a long-term winner for some time to come.
But all those positives have not helped Nvidia escape the sell-off in tech stocks, and its stock price has dropped more than some of its mega-tech counterparts. Amid this drop, investors may want to consider putting off additional purchases of the chip stock for one critical but overlooked reason.

The state of Nvidia
Currently, Nvidia sells for a P/E ratio of around 60. This multiple is low compared to some growth-oriented tech stocks trading today. It might also seem reasonable considering that in fiscal 2022, revenue climbed 61% year over year to $26.9 billion. Also, during the same period, net income of $9.8 billion increased by 125%.
Aside from the triple-digit income growth, the stock price increased by nearly 740% over the last five years, around eight times as much growth as the S&P 500 over that time.
Unfortunately for Nvidia investors, the stock has become a victim of the overall economic environment. It has not experienced the approximate 60% decline that has hit growth tech funds such as the Ark Innovation ETF. Still, like its rival, Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia has experienced a stock price drop of almost 35%. This does not compare well to Apple, which experienced a more modest 15% correction.
Still, Apple sells for a P/E ratio of just over 25, which may explain the more muted decline. Also, with tech stock prices falling, investors are less likely to buy any stock at a premium, even one that produces strong results like Nvidia.
An overlooked danger for Nvidia
Moreover, Nvidia has become disconnected from reality in terms of its overlooked political risk. Nvidia is fabless, meaning its chip fabrication depends on outsourcing manufacturing to East Asia, a region with more than its share of political tension these days.
Much of this risk revolves around the primary foundries it depends on to produce its chips, the largest of which is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). Because the company produces most of its chips in Taiwan, TSMC effectively puts Nvidia in the middle of Taiwan's tensions with China. Because China needs Nvidia's semiconductors just like every other country does right now, it could act as a deterrent to an escalation in hostilities. Still, the situation should concern Nvidia stockholders since Taiwan has been under threat of Chinese invasion for decades.
Furthermore, in the foundry industry, TSMC holds the technical lead and produces just over half of the world's chips, according to TrendForce. This strongly links Nvidia's fortunes to TSMC's prosperity.
Investors should also note that TSMC's stock has not escaped this political risk. Despite the severe chip shortage, TSMC has not sold for more than 40 times earnings in recent years. Also, even with a technical lead, it currently trades at a 25 P/E ratio.
Furthermore, Nvidia's other primary foundry, Samsung, faces similar political dangers with its South Korea-based foundries. This risk and TSMC's lower multiple could lead investors to question the wisdom of paying a premium for Nvidia when it effectively faces the same political risks as its primary foundries.
Trading Nvidia amid the political risk
Nvidia's technical lead and massive revenue growth should mean that the stock beats the S&P 500 over time. However, investors should consider holding out for a much lower valuation.
With almost all tech stocks falling, stockholders should not expect it to buck overall market trends. Moreover, most of its chip production occurs in a region dealing with geopolitical tensions. This probably means that if TSMC deserves to trade at a discount, so does Nvidia.

Fed Hikes Rate, Growth Stocks See Surprise Gains: 5 Top Picks
In line with market expectations, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points. Fed's dot plot has indicated six more hikes this year — a more hawkish tone than the December guideline. Yet the growth sectors, especially, technology and consumer discretionary, jumped after the Fed's decision. Growth stocks are generally susceptible to higher market interest rates.
Consequently, technology or consumer discretionary stocks remain attractive from an investment point of view. Investment in technology or consumer discretionary behemoths with a favorable Zacks Rank should provide good returns going forward. Five of them are Apple Inc., Marriott International Inc., NVIDIA Corp., Analog Devices Inc., and Micron Technology Inc.
Fed Raises Interest Rate
On Mar 16, the Fed announced after the completion of its 2-day FOMC meeting that it would raise the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points effective immediately. The Fed funds flow rate will now be hiked to the range of 0.25-0.50% from 0-0.25% set by the central bank on March 2022 to combat the pandemic.
Fed's dot-plot, a graphic representation of the views of Fed officials, indicated that six  more rate hike of the same magnitude would come this year, followed by another three in next year. The Fed projected that the benchmark interest rate would be around 1.9% by this year-end.
Moreover, the quantitative easing program of buying $120 billion of bonds per month will terminate this month. Additionally, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank would start shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet, mostly consisting of U.S. Treasury Notes and mortgage-backed securities from May 2022. This will result in another form of rate hike.
Rate Hike Seems Factored in Market Valuation
Higher market interest rate is detrimental for stock investment specifically for growth sectors like technology and consumer discretionary. The value of these stocks generally increases over a longer period of time. A hike in market interest rate will raise the discount rate, thereby reducing the net present value of technology or consumer discretionary stocks.
However, on Mar 16, the major gainers on Wall Street were the technology and consumer discretionary sectors. The Technology Select Sector SPDR and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR rallied 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively. On the other hand, XLK and XLY have tumbled 13.2% and 14.3% year to date.
It seems that a 2% hike in the interest rate this year is already priced in market valuation. Wall Street has suffered significant turmoil since the beginning of 2022, in contrast to the outstanding performances in the last two pandemic-ridden years. The three major indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 6.3%, 8.6% and 14.1%, respectively, year to date.
The primary reason for this disappointing performance is market participants' expectation  of a more hawkish Fed looking to combat the mounting interest rate, which is currently at a 40-year high. The ongoing geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine has exaggerated the inflationary condition. Therefore, the jump in XLK and XLY on Mar 16 indicated that a 2% hike in the Fed fund rate this year is already factored in the market's valuation.  
Our Top Picks  
We have narrowed our search to five corporate giants from technology or consumer discretionary sectors. These companies have a robust business model, globally acclaimed brand recognition and a solid financial position to cope with a higher interest rate.
Moreover, these stocks have strong growth potential for 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days, indicating solid business opportunities in the near-term. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Apple is benefiting from the continued momentum in the Services and a robust performance by iPhone, iPad, Mac, Wearables and an expanding App Store ecosystem. Although Apple's business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company's new cash cow. AAPL currently has more than 745 million paid subscribers across its Services portfolio.
Apple is encouraging developers to use artificial intelligence and machine learning in their apps. The company's Core ML 2 API helps developers recognize faces or animals in photos, and parse the meaning of the text. AAPL's focus on autonomous vehicles and augmented reality/virtual reality technologies presents growth opportunities for the long haul.
Apple has an expected earnings growth rate of 9.8% for the current year (ending September 2022). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.
Marriott is benefiting from its focus on expansion initiatives, digital innovation and the loyalty program. MAR is gaining from the reopening of the international borders and leniency in travel restrictions.
Marriott is consistently trying to expand its worldwide presence and capitalize on the demand for hotels in the international markets. The U.S. and global economies have reopened to a great extent as new coronavirus cases have dropped considerably. Several countries are gradually removing travel restrictions. MAR will be a major gainer of the economy's reopening.
Marriott has an expected earnings growth rate of 73% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.5% over the last 30 days.
NVIDIA is benefiting from the coronavirus-induced work and learn-at-home wave. NVIDIA is also benefiting from strong growth in GeForce desktop and notebook GPUs, which is boosting gaming revenues. Moreover, a surge in Hyperscale demand remains a tailwind for NVIDIA's Data Center business.
The expansion of NVIDIA GeForce NOW is expected to drive its user base. Further, the solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions is a boon. The collaboration with Daimler-owned Mercedes-Benz is expected to strengthen NVIDIA's presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics spaces.
NVDA has an expected earnings growth rate of 25.2% for the current year (ending January 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 7.8% over the last 30 days.
Analog Devices has strength across communication, consumer, industrial and automotive end-markets. Further, solid demand for high-performance analog and mixed-signal solutions is a tailwind. Growing momentum across the electric vehicle space on the back of robust Battery Management System solutions remains positive for ADI.
Further, growing power design wins are the other positives for Analog Devices. The solid momentum of the HEV platform across the cabin electronics ecosystem remains a tailwind for ADI. Moreover, Analog Devices remains optimistic about the growth prospects associated with its Maxim acquisition and 5G.
ADI has an expected earnings growth rate of 28.8% for the current year (ending October 2022). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.5% over the last 30 days.
Micron Technology is witnessing growing demand for memory chips from cloud-computing providers and acceleration in 5G cellular network adoptions. The rising mix of high-value solutions, enhancement in customer engagement and improvement in cost structure are the other growth drivers of MU.
Further, 5G adoption beyond mobile is likely to spur demand for memory and storage, particularly in Internet of Things devices and wireless infrastructure. These will act as major positives for Micron Technology going forward.
MU has an expected earnings growth rate of 47.7% for the current year (ending August 2022). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.4% over the last 30 days.

After four powerful rallies, stocks took a needed break on Monday. With that in mind, let’s look at where the market may find its footing and eye some top stock trades in the meantime.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Nasdaq ETF (QQQ)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TradingView
Looking at the Nasdaq via the Invesco QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ), notice the four-day surge into a very notable area on the chart.
In a video from Sunday night, I noted that the QQQ and the Nasdaq are rallying into four key areas of potential resistance. They include the 61.8% retracement (from the March low to the February high), the fourth-quarter low, the March high and the declining 50-day moving average.
Whew! That’s a lot of levels. Not surprisingly, the QQQ and the Nasdaq are pulling back on Monday. Where it finds its footing is now the key. I would love to see the QQQ hold up over the 10-day and 21-day moving averages — the latter of which has been active resistance.
Below that and we’ll start talking about the $330 to $335 area again.
9 Gold Stocks to Buy as Global Fears Rise
On the upside, though, a move above Monday’s high — and even better, a close above it — opens the door to the $363 area. Above that puts the February high and the 200-day in play.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Shopify (SHOP)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) roared higher on Friday, rallying more than 18%, then face-planted hard on Monday. At one point, shares were down more than 16% during the session. It’s really unfortunate for the longs because this is a fantastic company.
With Monday’s action, we have an inside day forming as Shopify stock holds above the 10-day and 21-day moving averages — again, those are prior active resistance levels — as well as the daily VWAP measure.
An inside-and-up rotation over Monday’s high could put last week’s high near $780 in play. That’s followed by the declining 50-day. Eventually, there’s a potential gap fill in play near $843.
On the downside, however, an inside-and-down rotation opens the door to all those key measures we just mentioned. If those fail as support, then $614 or lower is in play. A close below $600 puts this month’s low in play.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Nvidia (NVDA)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been one of the few stocks that have been trading really well. On Friday, we were about to capitalize on the strong rally and trim into the $265 area.
That allowed traders to move to a break-even stop-loss on the remainder of their position while targeting a further push. While it wavered on Monday, the next area I’m watching is $275 to $277. That’s the 50% retracement of the entire range. Beyond that opens the door to the $290s — the 61.8% retracement.
As for today, the stock is running into the February high and VWAP measure off the November high.
7 Apple Supplier Stocks to Watch Following AAPL's March Event
If we get a real unraveling in the stock, watch the 10-day and 50-day moving averages. Bulls need these levels to be support.
Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Nike (NKE)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Earnings are due up for Nike (NYSE:NKE) after the close, and the stock has not been trading well. Although it’s a high-quality company, the market has been selling without discretion lately.
Many of the high-quality retailers have rallied after reporting this quarter, but Nike is a blend between a retailer and apparel maker.
Now trapped between the 10-day and 21-day moving averages after a strong rally, what levels matter on the move?
On a bullish post-earnings rally, I’m watching the declining 10-week moving average, followed by the $139.50 level and the declining 50-day. Above that puts the prior support zone in play near $145.
On the downside, though, there’s an open gap near $120.40. Below that puts this month’s low in play at $116.75, followed by the 200-week moving average. If it were to test down into the latter, it would mark a decline of 14% from current levels.

Chicago, IL – March 22, 2022 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM.
Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:
Top Analyst Reports for Amazon, NVIDIA and JPMorgan
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc., NVIDIA Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
You can see all of today's research reports here >>>
Shares of Amazon have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (+3.6% vs. -39.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that Amazon is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Further, strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive.
Also, growing momentum across Amazon Music is contributing well. Additionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company's cloud dominance. Also, expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers.
Further, robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. Additionally, the company's strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. However, growing expenses associated with supply-chain constraints and labor supply shortages remain concerns.
(You can read the full research report on Amazon here >>>) 
Shares of NVIDIA have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+100.6% vs. +33.0%). The Zacks analyst believes that NVIDIA is benefiting from the coronavirus-induced work and learn-from-home wave. It is also benefiting from strong growth in GeForce desktop and notebook Graphic Processing Units, which is boosting gaming revenues.
Moreover, a surge in Hyperscale demand remains a tailwind for the company's Data Center business. Expansion of NVIDIA GeForce NOW is expected to drive user base. Further, solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions is a boon.
Additionally, collaboration with Mercedes-Benz is expected to further strengthen NVIDIA's presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, management expects COVID-19 pandemic to negatively impact near-term revenues. Moreover, the U.S.-China trade war remains a key concern.
(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>) 
Shares of JPMorgan have underperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six month period (-7.2% vs. +5.7%). The Zacks analyst believes that normalization of the trading business is expected to hurt the company's fee income growth, going forward. Further, relatively lower interest rates in the near term are expected to keep weighing on the company's margins and interest income. Steadily rising operating expenses remains a major near-term headwind. 
However, opening new branches, strategic acquisitions/investments, global expansion and digitization initiatives, and decent investment banking (IB) pipeline are expected to keep supporting the company's financials. Additionally, its steady capital deployments look sustainable and will enhance shareholder value.

Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Medtronic plc (MDT) and McDonald's Corp. (MCD).

2022-03-23 00:00:00+00:00,Why Vicor Shares Powered Off Today,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-vicor-shares-powered-off-today,"What happened
Shares of power module specialist Vicor (NASDAQ: VICR) went dark on Wednesday afternoon, trading 21.4% lower as of 3:40 p.m. ET. Analyst firm CJS Securities downgraded the stock from market outperform to market perform. The analyst cited pictures showing a new artificial intelligence (AI) chip from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) that doesn't feature the distinctive golden boxes of Vicor power conversion chips that are found in earlier versions.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
According to CJS analyst Jonathan Tanwanteng, Nvidia is Vicor's largest customer. Half of the growth in advanced power system sales may be lost if the graphics-chip designer removed these power control modules from its latest AI products. Tanwanteng also noted that Nvidia's hand might have been forced by limited supplies of Vicor's advanced products, and that high demand from other customers also could have played a part.
Now what
Furthermore, the analyst said that Vicor holds a unique advantage over the competition thanks to higher efficiency and density than anyone else. That should ensure a ""commanding share"" of the next-generation AI computing market. But the supply chain is so overloaded that clients could skip this generation of Vicor's product upgrades. That would be bad news for the company's profit margins as older and less lucrative chips start to cannibalize design slots that should have gone to the latest and greatest solution.
Formerly set to $150 per share, the firm's target price for Vicor's stock is under review. Share prices are down 63% from November's all-time highs, but the stock still trades at a lofty 62 times earnings and 502 times free cash flows.

NEW YORK, March 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended sharply higher on Thursday, extending the market's recent rebound, as investors snapped up beaten-down chipmakers and big growth names and as oil prices dropped.

2022-03-25 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Dropped on Friday,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-dropped-on-friday,"What happened
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock was one of the strongest performers out of a group of many strong performing semiconductor stocks Thursday -- and for good reason. On Thursday, Nvidia sketched out plans to attack what it called a trillion-dollar opportunity to grow its annual sales many times in size, foreseeing eventual addressable markets as big as:
$300 billion for sales of automotive chips.
$300 billion more from sales of other chips and systems.
$150 billion from selling artificial-intelligence enterprise software.
$150 million from Omniverse enterprise software.
$100 billion in annual revenue from video gaming services such as GeForce Now.
Of course, that still leaves the question why Nvidia stock is down 2.8% as of noon ET today.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
So what changed today? Two things, actually, one good for Nvidia, and one not so good.
The good news today is that Bank of America just released a note describing a new investing acronym for investors: ""MANGO,"" which appears to be short for the semiconductor stocks Marvell Technology, Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia, GlobalFoundries, and ON Semiconductor. (If you want to stretch the acronym a bit, you might also include Broadcom -- which doesn't seem to fit alphabetically until you recall that its stock ticker is still ""AVGO."")
Bank of America believes that the ""structural importance of semis to the rapidly digitizing global economy cannot be overstated,"" reports TheFly.com today. For this reason, the analyst is highlighting these five (or six) semiconductor stocks as his favorites, saying they're all ""levered to the right end-markets with solid demand visibility and consistent execution.""
Now what
As I said, that's the good news. Now here's the bad: All five (indeed, six) of these semiconductor stocks had already risen strongly on Thursday, before Bank of America shook the tree and dropped this new investing acronym on us. As a result, investors aren't reacting as strongly today to BofA's endorsement as they might have reacted had the stocks not already run higher yesterday.
Instead, investors appear to be taking profits today after yesterday's strong performance. Granted, that's not necessarily bad news for the business prospects of any of these companies. It's certainly not great news for their stock prices today, however.
And it means investors may need to wait for a pullback if they want a ripe opportunity to pick some cheap Nvidia shares again.

2022-03-28 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-too-late-to-buy-nvidia-stock-2,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has started flying once again, with shares of the graphics card specialist gaining 32% since March 14. The stock is now trading at 72 times trailing earnings, which is higher than the multiple it was trading at in the middle of March. Does this mean that investors who didn't take advantage of the pullback in Nvidia stock have missed an opportunity to buy this fast-growing tech company? Let's find out.
Nvidia is expensive, but the valuation remains attractive
There is no doubt that Nvidia remains an expensive stock to buy. However, investors looking for a growth stock should note that the graphics card specialist was trading at a whopping 90 times earnings last year. Going back to 2020, Nvidia remained expensive with a price-to-earnings ratio of 85. It was only in 2019 that Nvidia's valuation was at a relatively cheap 60 times earnings.
NVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts
Since early 2020, Nvidia stock has jumped a massive 400%. The stock handsomely rewarded investors who had bought at 60 times earnings back in 2019. So, growth-oriented investors still have an opportunity to buy the stock before it gets even more expensive due to multiple upcoming catalysts that should help the company maintain its outstanding growth pace.
Hot tech trends should ensure rapid long-term growth
At Nvidia's recent developer conference, the company revealed new products that support its aggressive pursuit of fast-growing markets such as artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled data centers, autonomous vehicles, and digital twin applications.
Nvidia unveiled the Grace Central Processing Unit (CPU) Superchip, which will target the high-performance computing (HPC) market and AI data centers. Nvidia says that this chip combines two interconnected server CPUs, and is capable of ""providing the highest performance and twice the memory bandwidth and energy-efficiency compared to today's leading server chips.""
The chipmaker also said that leading players in the HPC, supercomputing, cloud, and hyperscale markets are already working with Nvidia to integrate the Grace Superchip into their applications. The product should be available in the first half of 2023. This move will be huge for Nvidia, marking its entry into a market where the company is currently absent.
By 2023, the server CPU market is expected to generate $19 billion in revenue. The space is currently dominated by Nvidia rivals Intel and AMD. According to Mercury Research, Intel controlled nearly 90% of the server CPU market at the end of 2021, with AMD holding the remaining market share. Nvidia's foray into this space is going to unlock a massive opportunity for the chipmaker that has the potential to substantially boost its revenue.
At the same developer conference, the chipmaker announced that its automotive pipeline had increased to $11 billion, a sizable increase from the $8 billion it was sitting on a year ago. This pipeline could soon translate into real revenue: the company's self-driving platforms are now in production and BYD, the world's second-largest electric vehicle manufacturer, announced it will build its next-generation fleet on Nvidia's DRIVE Hyperion architecture.
BYD is just one of many companies tapping Nvidia's autonomous driving system to power their self-driving vehicles. With these partnerships, it wouldn't be surprising to see the chipmaker's automotive business gain robust traction in the future. By expanding this business segment, Nvidia could generate substantial revenue: last fiscal year, automotive brought in $566 million for the company, accounting for only 2% of total revenue.

Nvidia OVX was another key product revealed at the conference that could supercharge long-term company growth. Nvidia has described OVX as being ""purpose-built to operate complex digital twin simulations"" of buildings, factories, warehouses, autonomous vehicles, or entire environments.
Digital twins will be the building blocks of the metaverse, as the technology creates virtual copies of physical objects and spaces such as offices, schools, colleges, stadiums, and other locations. As the metaverse aims to connect people within virtual 3D spaces, the digital twin market is going to expand at a terrific pace in the future. A third-party estimate projects that the current $10.27 billion digital twin market could grow at an annual pace of 35% through 2027.
Still a good buy
Nvidia's revenue shot up 61% in fiscal year 2022 to $26.9 billion. Adjusted earnings were up 78% to $4.44 per share. So far, the video gaming and data center markets have been the pillars of this terrific growth, and they are likely to help the company maintain its momentum in the long run. And now that the company is ready to tap into more lucrative markets, its revenue and earnings could grow substantially over the long run.
Investment bank Cowen (NASDAQ: COWN) estimates that Nvidia could generate $140 billion in revenue and $28 per share in earnings by 2028. That would be a huge jump over last year's numbers, and indicates that Nvidia could remain a top growth stock for a long time to come.

2022-03-29 00:00:00+00:00,What Do Slowing GPU Demand Trends Spell for Nvidia Stock? Analyst Weighs In,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-do-slowing-gpu-demand-trends-spell-for-nvidia-stock-analyst-weighs-in,"Based on industry checks with those in the know, Baird's 5-star analyst Tristan Gerra notes that consumer GPU inventories are on the rise. This spells bad news for GPU leader Nvidia (NVDA).
Demand weakness in Asia appears to be one of the culprits and to an extent so is the embargo on Russia shipments. Additionally, in anticipation of Ethereum’s migration from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, miners appear to be selling hardware.
March saw a month-over-month price drop of 25% for consumer GPUs, with prices now 25% above historical levels. This brings the pricing back to levels last seen at the beginning of 2021. This is below the 80%+ premium over the MSRP (manufacturer’s suggested retail price) of a quarter ago and some way off May 2021’s more than double the MSRP for GPUs. The prices for Nvidia's RTX 3080 series are also declining.  
“While Nvidia sells at MSRP and would not be impacted by the price declines, current ASP trends reflect softening demand as card availability improves. Based on our checks, we note no shortages of graphic cards in the Asia markets,"" says Gerra.
With regards to the sale of GPUs intended for Ethereum mining, Gerra says it is hard to tell what the percentage of cryptocurrency mining is compared to total consumer GPU demand. At the 2018 cycle peak, it was thought to be as high as 40% of the mix. Gerra anticipates miner selling dynamics will “worsen” in C2H22.
Additionally, over the past three months, graphic card resellers’ revenue has been “tracking below” normal seasonality, down more than 20%, which compares unfavorably to the low single-digit decline usually seen during the same period.
Providing some succor, data center demand “remains strong and will continue to be an offset near term.”
For now, Gerra stays with the bulls, reiterating an Outperform (i.e., Buy) and $360 price target on NVDA shares. This figure conveys his confidence in NVDA's ability to rise ~24% in the next twelve months. (To watch Gerra's track record, click here)
Most analysts are reading from the same manual; based on 21 Buys vs. 5 Holds, the stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating. Going by the $350.22 average target, investors will be sitting on returns of 24% a year from now. (See Nvidia stock analysis on TipRanks)

2022-03-30 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Slumped Today,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-slumped-today-0,"What happened
Shares of chips giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) slipped in late morning trading on Wednesday, down 2.6% as of 11:30 a.m. ET despite modestly positive news in the semiconductor space.
There was no bad news for Nvidia specifically -- but the good news wasn't all that great.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Take semiconductors peer company Micron (NASDAQ: MU) for example. Micron reported a big earnings beat for its second quarter of fiscal 2022 last night, and guided investors to expect another beat in the third quarter. Net income at the maker of computer memory roughly quadrupled year over year, and sales were up 25%, indicating continued strong demand for semiconductors.
Nevertheless, while Micron improved a lot year over year, it didn't show a lot of sequential improvement in its results. Sequentially, gross profit margin at Micron grew by only 80 basis points, while operating profit margin declined by 150 basis points. Sequentially, Micron's operating and net profits both declined, as did its per-share earnings -- and all of this may have set some investors to worrying today about where semiconductors are heading in the near term.
Now what
And now consider what's happening at Nvidia itself. As my colleague Chris Neiger noted yesterday, Nvidia just won a target price hike from Tigress Financial, which called Nvidia ""the world's leading AI processing provider"" and predicted that Nvidia would continue ""to expand its leadership position in all areas"" of semiconducting, and in data centers in particular.
Nevertheless, all this bullishness was worth to Tigress was an extra $10 in target price, as it hiked Nvidia from $400 to $410. While a move in price target up is certainly better than a move in price target down, as Chris noted yesterday, Tigress' tiny hike simply didn't excite investors very much, and Nvidia struggled to maintain momentum all day long despite stock markets generally rising.
In the context of today's mostly down stock market, with both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq in the red, it's no huge surprise to see Nvidia stock falling in tandem.

Shares of semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) dropped in Friday afternoon trading, falling 2.9% through 12:55 p.m. ET.
In the absence of any other news on Nvidia stock per se, it appears today's drop is tied to a Yahoo! Finance column that may have spooked investors.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Specifically, Yahoo! technology editor Daniel Howley warned today that ""Intel is coming for Nvidia and AMD,"" and launching a new line of ""Arc"" graphics chips to attack Nvidia's (and AMD's) dominance in gaming. And granted, a line like ""X company is coming for Y company"" probably sounds a little bit scary -- but I really don't believe investors need to be frightened at this point.
Why not? Well, if you read past the headline, it turns out that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is still only ""teasing"" its introduction of Arc, and the company will only ""eventually release"" the new GPUs -- but has not yet.
That simply doesn't sound like a clear and present danger to me.
Now what
Granted, some of the arguments in the column make sense. ""U.S. PC hardware sales grew 25% to $5.74 billion in 2021. And gaming isn't going anywhere anytime soon,"" for example. But while Yahoo! frames these statements as arguments for why Intel might want to expand its market share in GPUs -- and I agree -- they're also pretty good arguments for why Nvidia might grow its graphics business quite well if Intel fails to capture market share with Arc.
As Yahoo! notes, nearly half of Nvidia's revenue in 2021 came from the company's gaming division. You can't expect that Nvidia would give up those kinds of numbers without a fight.
Finally, consider further that, as Yahoo! admits, ""we don't even know how Intel's Arc chip compares to Nvidia or AMD's entry-level discrete chips"" yet. Given the uncertainty surrounding both Intel's timeline and its capabilities, I simply don't see this story as something Nvidia investors need to worry about anytime soon.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +16.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.6% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has gained 10.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share, indicating a change of +40.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $5.55 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +25%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.37 indicates a change of +14.7% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nvidia.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
In the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $8.11 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +43.3%. The $34.5 billion and $39.56 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +28.2% and +14.7%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Nvidia reported revenues of $7.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +52.8%. EPS of $1.32 for the same period compares with $0.78 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.85%. The EPS surprise was +8.2%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has managed to climb nearly 20% over the past month. It’s time to pick up Nvidia shares while they are still selling at a discount. Currently trading in the $280 range, that may not sound cheap, but shares are still off more than 20% from their November 2021 all-time high close of $333.76.

Given the way this company’s business is going — and the projections for future growth — you’re liable to be kicking yourself if you don’t pick up shares at current prices.
Here are the reasons why NVDA stock has nowhere to go but up. 
Nvidia’s Current Business Is Going Strong
Going back to February, Nvidia reported its Q4 and full-year fiscal 2022 results. The company reported record quarterly revenue (up 53% year-over-year) and record annual revenue (up 61% YoY). The company’s Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization divisions each reported record quarterly and annual revenue. Adjusted earnings-per-share of $1.32 topped the $1.22 analysts were expecting. 
Nvidia’s CEO summed up the performance and what’s coming: “We are entering the new year with strong momentum across our businesses and excellent traction with our new software business models with NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA DRIVE. GTC is coming. We will announce many new products, applications and partners for NVIDIA computing.”
The mention of GTC is very important. Because what Nvidia revealed at that conference (which wrapped up last week), will make last year’s record $26.91 billion seem quaint.
Nvidia At GTC 2022
I’ve already written about the massive opportunity the metaverse represents for Nvidia, and for NVDA stock’s growth. That was before GTC 2022.
Nvidia’s GTC 2022 (Graphics Technology Conference) took place from March 21 through March 24. At the event, Nvidia showed off its latest new products and laid out a plan for the future that has investors drooling.
Among the key announcements were new Hopper architecture for its data center AI systems. These Hopper chips will power the Eos supercomputer, which is expected to be the world’s fastest AI supercomputer when it begins operations later in 2022. Its projected 18.4 exaflops of AI computing performance would make it four times faster than the current champion, Japan’s Fugaku supercomputer. Hopper is expected to be commercially available in the first half of 2023.
7 Web 3.0 Cryptos That Could Be the Next High-Flier
Joining Hopper is Grace, a new GPU superchip for the data center market. This new chip will also hit the market in the first half of 2023. Nvidia’s new DRIVE Hyperion 9 driving platform architecture arrives in 2026, doubling the performance of the current DRIVE Orin-based architecture. In addition, Nvidia is releasing a new Isaac Nova Orin platform for autonomous robotics.
What about the metaverse? While pushing its own Omniverse as a solution for creating massive, ultra-realistic simulations, Nvidia is making it available to a wider audience. The company’s new Omniverse Cloud eliminates the need for a PC with an RTX graphics card. 
The company also announced six new RTX series GPUs. These are aimed at gaming PCs and laptops, as well as professional and creative markets.
Why is all this a big deal for NVDA stock growth? InvestorPlace contributor Shanthi Rexaline has a nice summary. This includes a long-term addressable market of $100 billion for gaming, $300 billion for software (including Omniverse), $300 billion for chips and systems and $300 billion for automotive.
You can see why 2021’s record revenue of $26.91 billion suddenly seems like it leaves Nvidia with plenty of runway for growth.
Bottom Line on NVDA Stock
With an “A” rating in Portfolio Grader, NVDA stock is a strong buy. I’m far from the only one who feels this way. The investment analysts polled by the Wall Street Journal give NVDA a consensus “overweight” rating. If shares hit their average price target of $343.47, that’s an upside in the range of 25%. And that takes us to just before those new Hopper and Grace chips are expected to start shipping.
Nvidia has been a powerhouse stock for the past six years. Its biggest crisis came in 2018 when the crypto market crashed and took demand for graphics cards with it. However, NVDA stock quickly came roaring back with more momentum than ever. Even a global pandemic, semiconductor shortages and supply chain disruption weren’t enough to knock NVDA off its growth trajectory. From the worst of the crypto crash fallout in December 2018 to November 19, 2021, NVDA delivered virtually nonstop growth and a return of over 900%.
Since then, macroeconomic factors that have resulted in a broad market pullback — hitting  tech stocks especially hard — have done some damage. NVDA stock appears to have shaken off the doubts and has been rallying for the past two weeks. At this point it is down just 9% from the start of the year. Now it’s going in the right direction once again, but still nicely discounted compared to its November 2021 all-time highs.
It’s time to make a move.

Down 18% year-to-date (YTD), now is a great time to buy shares of semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
With its market leading position, strong earnings and future growth opportunities, investors should view the current pullback in NVDA stock as a buying opportunity. Currently trading at $240.50 a share, down over 30% from its 52-week high of $346.47, Nvidia’s stock looks to be on sale right now and is one of the best technology companies that investors can buy for the long-term.
In recent notes to clients, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) each recommended Nvidia as a top semiconductor stock. Bank of America sees Nvidia achieving massive growth from semiconductor chip sales tied to cloud computing and artificial intelligence, while Citibank said it sees several catalysts for NVDA stock this year, including the holiday gaming season and demand for data center chips. Among 40 analysts who cover Nvidia, the average price target on the stock is currently $344.27 a share, implying 43% upside.
In mid-February, Nvidia reported another in a string of exceptionally strong earnings reports. The Santa Clara, California-based company announced fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.32, which was 69% higher than a year earlier and beat the $1.22 that was expected by analysts. Nvidia also reported revenue for Q4 of $7.64 billion, up 53% year-over-year and higher than the $7.42 billion expected on the street. The company attributed the strong earnings to continued demand for its semiconductor chips and the easing of global supply constraints.
7 Biotech Stocks to Buy With Key Catalysts for April
Equally impressive was the forward guidance Nvidia provided. The company forecast revenue of $8.1 billion in the first quarter that just ended, which was higher than analyst expectations of $7.29 billion. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement that Nvidia’s supply constraints continue to ease and the company’s supply of products should increase “substantially” in the second half of this year.
If there is one blemish on Nvidia, it is that the company was forced to abandon its planned $40 billion acquisition of British chipmaker Arm Ltd. after competition regulators around the world balked at the tie-up. However, even without the Arm deal, Nvidia does not look to have missed a beat. The company continues to grow at a fast but sustainable clip, and demand for its products is only increasing as technology sectors such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence grow and mature. Demand also remains strong for the graphics processing units that Nvidia makes and are used in video game consoles. The company’s chips are even used by cryptocurrency miners.
The current downturn in Nvidia’s stock is due largely to the broader retrenchment in tech names and has nothing to do with the company’s performance. The underlying fundamentals at Nvidia remain rock solid and the share price should recover in time and test new highs. As such, investors should act now and buy NVDA stock. The shares are not likely to remain on sale long.

  Shares of NVIDIA have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+70.6% vs. +19.4%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company is benefiting from the coronavirus-induced work and learn-from-home wave. It is also benefiting from strong growth in GeForce desktop and notebook Graphic Processing Units, which is boosting gaming revenues.
Moreover, a surge in Hyperscale demand remains a tailwind for the company’s Data Center business. Expansion of NVIDIA GeForce NOW is expected to drive the user base. Further, solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions is a boon.
  Additionally, collaboration with Mercedes-Benz is expected to further strengthen NVIDIA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, management expects COVID-19 pandemic to negatively impact near-term revenues. Moreover, the U.S.-China trade war remains a key concern.

  Shares of Coca-Cola have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (+22.4% vs. +15.5%). The company has outpaced the industry in a year on a robust surprise trend, which continued in fourth-quarter 2021. Its top and the bottom line surpassed estimates for the fourth straight quarter.
The Zacks analyst believes that the company is benefited from the strategic transformation and ongoing recovery around the world. Revenues gained from the investments and ongoing recovery in markets, where the pandemic-led disruptions are subsiding. Strength across the majority of the markets, investments in the marketplace, recovery in certain markets as well as the cycling of last year’s pandemic-led impacts aided volumes.
  The company provided an upbeat 2022 view. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. However, pressures from higher supply chain costs, including transportation and input costs remain. Higher marketing spending is also concerning.
  (You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here >>>)
  Shares of Thermo Fisher have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+24.9% vs. +0.4%). The company delivered 8% organic growth in the base business, which is ahead of streets expectations. It witnessed robust year-over-year revenue growth across the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments.
The Zacks analyst believes that the company’s strategic acquisitions of PPD, Inc. and PeproTech raise investors’ confidence. Thermo Fisher’s accelerated investments to expand bioproduction capacity also buoy optimism. The upbeat guidance for 2022 is indicative that this growth momentum will continue.
  However, the year-over-year decline in fourth-quarter earnings raises apprehension. The decline in revenues in the other two segments is also disappointing. Contraction of both margins does not bode well either.

Stifel analyst David Grossman maintained a Buy rating on the tech stock in the wake of the news.

HP (HPQ, -7.1%) was downgraded to Neutral (Hold) from Buy at UBS Global Research.

Stock Selection is Becoming Increasingly Important
Next week, we'll start to get a look at the latest inflation figures with Tuesday's release of the consumer price index. Plus, the start of earnings season will offer an initial gauge of how corporate America fared during a period of scorching prices.
This will be especially important to investors looking to target firms that have been able to withstand red-hot inflation thanks to rock-solid balance sheets.

A focus on quality stocks will give them a better shot at building resilience in their portfolios, according to Tony DeSpirito, CIO of BlackRock's U.S. Fundamental Active Equities. He says that stock selection is becoming more important as investors ""must discern which companies are most impacted by rising costs, and which have the pricing power to pass those higher costs through to consumers and maintain their profit margins.""

2022-04-11 00:00:00+00:00,Consumer Chip Demand Will Be Just Fine. Buy NVDA Stock on the Dip.,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/consumer-chip-demand-will-be-just-fine.-buy-nvda-stock-on-the-dip.,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It has not been an easy run for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) lately. In fact, most semiconductor stocks have been struggling. So far on Monday, that skid has yet to come to a halt. NVDA stock is lower by more than 5%, as it looks set to decline for a fifth straight session. If Nvidia closes lower today, it will mark the eighth decline in the past nine sessions.
The latest culprit? A downgrade.
Baird analyst Tristan Gerra downgraded NVDA stock due to multiple concerns, cutting his rating from outperform to neutral. He also cut his price target from $360 to $225. He argued that there has been a decrease in PC demand and Nvidia risks cancellations of consumer GPUs, which he attributes to “excess inventories.” Further, he notes that Russian embargo sanctions are not being priced into the stock.
Overall, the tone on Wall Street remains optimistic given Nvidia’s long-term opportunities. However, analysts are also realistic about short-term issues. According to Gerra, PCs are one concern. For others, it’s automotive. It’s no secret that the automotive sector has faced more than its fair share of supply chain disruptions — some of which have come from semiconductors.
Not long ago, General Motors (NYSE:GM) had to idle some of its production due to a chip-supply issue. While automotive revenue is not the top sales unit for Nvidia, it’s still significant — and growing. The company generated more than $560 million in sales from this segment in fiscal 2022 and looks to grow that total as EV and AV technologies continue to grow.
Wheeling back to NVDA stock, it has been a painful stretch for shareholders. According to Dow Jones Market Data, this puts the stock at its worst five-day stretch since its 19.9% drop on March 16, 2020.
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
If we zoom out on the weekly chart, it’s clear that support has been in the low-$200s. That area is back in play now that NVDA stock failed to hold the 50-week moving average and the weekly VWAP measure.
7 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy for April 2022
At the same time, we’re seeing Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) finally break below its key support level near $100. Will Nvidia soon do the same? It may, and if it does, it will put the 21-week moving average in play, which was a key support level in March 2020.
We don’t want to blindly buy the dip, but as NVDA stock nears a 40% pullback from the highs, it’s certainly one that long-term bulls want to have on their radar.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

  Apple shares have gained +24% over the past year against the +8.2% gain for the S&P 500 index on the back of continued momentum in services and robust performance from iPhone, Mac, Wearables, and an expanding App Store ecosystem. Availability of new Mac Studio, new iPad Air and the most affordable iPhone SE. Apple TV+ is gaining recognition with shows like Ted Lasso winning Emmy and CODA wining Academy Award for Best Picture.
  However, Apple did not provide revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, given the uncertainty around the impact of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Apple expects to achieve solid year-over-year revenue growth and set a second quarter revenue record despite significant supply constraints, which it estimates to be less than the fiscal first quarter.

Shares of Berkshire Hathaway have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+31.8% vs. +19%). The Zacks analyst sees this performance continuing for this property and casualty insurance leader that is effectively financial conglomerate and Warren Buffett's investment vehicle. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and indicates the company's financial flexibility. Continued insurance business growth fuels an increase in float, drives earnings, and generates maximum return on equity.

The non-insurance businesses are delivering improved results with increased revenues over the past few years. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus. However, exposure to catastrophe loss induces earnings volatility and also affects the property and casualty underwriting results of Berkshire. Huge capital expenditure remains a headwind for the company.

(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>>)

Shares of JPMorgan have underperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past year (-11.4% vs. -1.7%) on growing uncertainty about the economic outlook in the wake of recent yield-curve developments. We will get a better sense of the operating environment after this week's Q1 earnings report, but estimates have been coming down lately given weak investment banking and trading business and rising expenses.
The ongoing Fed tightening cycle is a net positive for JPMorgan and the peer group as it will help boost margins. The outlook for loan demand also appears favorable, though sustainability of the trend is far from certain.
Zacks analyst believes that the normalization of the trading business is expected to hurt the company's fee income growth, going forward. Further, relatively lower interest rates in the near term are expected to keep weighing on the company’s margins and interest income. Steadily rising operating expenses remain a major near-term headwind.
 
However, opening new branches, strategic acquisitions/investments, global expansion and digitization initiatives, and decent investment banking (IB) pipeline are expected to keep supporting the company's financials. Additionally, its steady capital deployments look sustainable and will enhance shareholder value.

April 13 (Reuters) - U.S. shares rose on Wednesday as a rebound in growth stocks on falling yields and strong results from Delta Air Lines offset declines in JPMorgan after the bank reported a slump in first-quarter profit in a mixed start to the earnings season.
Megacaps Apple Inc AAPL.O and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O rose 1.7% each, while Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O gained 2.7% and 1.9%, respectively, after chipmakers' shares got battered this week.
The Philadelphia semiconductor index .SOX climbed 2.2% after dropping nearly 20.9% so far this year.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell, helping tech and tech-adjacent stocks that have been under pressure in the last few weeks, even as data showed producer prices increased more than expected in March amid a surge in demand for services. US/
""The market is coming to the conclusion that the March data is likely to be the peak,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.
Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors advanced. Industrial stocks .SPLRCI gained 0.8% helped by a surge in airline shares.
Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N jumped 4.3% after posting a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and forecasting a return to profit in the current quarter on the back of booming travel demand.
""Delta Airlines is in the sweet spot of the reopening trade,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
""Investors have been taking a wait and see attitude, but it looks like a very positive response to Delta and likely the other travel and leisure names.""
Other airlines such as American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O, United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O and Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N gained between 5.2% and 9.0%.
Meanwhile, capping market gains, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N fell 2.9% as CEO Jamie Dimon warned of economic uncertainties arising from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and soaring inflation, after first-quarter profits at the largest U.S. bank slumped 42%.
Other big banks Citigroup Inc C.N, Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, Morgan Stanley MS.N and Bank of America Corp BAC.N, which report later this week and next week, fell between 0.2% and 1.0%.
At 12:23 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 189.79 points, or 0.55%, at 34,410.15, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 34.01 points, or 0.77%, at 4,431.46, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 215.23 points, or 1.61%, at 13,586.81.
Analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to have increased by about 6% in the first quarter, compared to the 32.1% jump in the fourth quarter of 2021, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, as an aggressive Fed, soaring inflation and geopolitical uncertainty due to the Ukraine conflict muddies the outlook for the earnings season.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 2.84-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 2.75-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded 17 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 34 new highs and 141 new lows.

2022-04-14 00:00:00+00:00,Short Week Turns Rocky as Inflation Woes Ramp Up,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/short-week-turns-rocky-as-inflation-woes-ramp-up,"Though the week was a short one, with markets closed on Friday for the holiday, Wall Street still had a lot to unpack by way of economic data and the start of earnings season. Stocks got off to a bumpy start on Monday, after a spike in the 10-year Treasury yield weighed heavily on the major indexes, sending both the Nasdaq and Dow to triple digit losses. The much anticipated consumer price index (CPI) reading was released on Tuesday, hitting its highest level since 1981, and topping analysts' expectations. While stocks initially rose amid speculation that this could be the peak for inflation, all three indexes eventually settled with more steep losses, marking a third-consecutive drop for both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. 
By midweek, earnings reports began trickling in, specifically from several major bank names. While a lackluster post-earnings performance from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) did little to boost the Dow, the broader market wound up catching some tailwinds from Delta Airlines (DAL) on Wednesday, which predicted a return to profit this quarter during its turn in the earnings confessional. As a result, stocks settled with notable gains, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both snapping a three-day losing streak. Thursday afternoon, however, saw both of these indexes move back below their respective breakeven levels. The Dow, meanwhile, got a bit of a boost from Goldman Sachs' impressive earnings report, but as of this writing, all three indexes were headed for weekly losses. 
Stocks Analysts Eyed This Week 
Amid all this market volatility and upcoming earnings reports, the brokerage bunch has been busy. In fact, Wells Fargo (WFC) received an upgrade from Citigroup to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" ahead of its quarterly release. Several other names weren't as lucky, including Dow member Cisco (CSCO), which was downgraded to ""sell"" by Citi, while Nvidia (NVDA) hit with a downgrade to ""neutral"" from Baird. Earlier in the week. PayPal (PYPL) was also targeted, suffering a price-target cut at the hands of Susquehanna after its CFO was tapped by Walmart (WMT). And while it seems like many analysts are stepping away from tech, IBM (IBM) was called a ""place to hide"" as economic risks ramp up. 
Look to the Past Before Considering These Stocks
This week, we broke down a few bigger names running into historically significant trendlines on the charts, which traders might want to consider before taking a bullish (or bearish) stance. A few stocks that have already seen strong performances in 2022, and might be ready to climb even higher, include Callon Petroleum (CPE) and Bloom Energy (BE). Meanwhile, Macy's (M) just ran up to a trendline that's put pressure on the stock in the past. 
Here's What Investors Should Focus on Next 
And speaking of looking to the past, Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White just pointed out that the S&P 500 hasn't gone this long since hitting a record high since 2018. Investors might be interested as to when we can expect the index to finally turn around. For even more clues on what past volatility has meant for markets, and how traders can apply that to their own portfolios going forward, Schaeffer's V.P. of Research Todd Salamone applies the old adage ""history may not repeat itself, but it does rhyme"" to Wall Street's current situation. 
In the meantime, traders can expect another full week of economic activity and earnings reports next week. On tap will be housing and building data, jobless claim updates and the purchasing managers' indexes (PMI). Highlighting a busy week for earnings will be American Airlines (AAL), Anthem (ANTM), AT&T (T), Bank of America (BAC), Charles Schwab (SCHW), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Procter & Gamble (PG), Tesla (TSLA), and Verizon (VZ), just to name a few.

2022-04-18 00:00:00+00:00,2 Semiconductor Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-semiconductor-growth-stocks-to-buy-now-and-hold,"The semiconductor sector, which is responsible for producing the advanced computer chips that power our favorite electronics, is large and complex. Most investors are familiar with industry darlings like Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices, but there's an entire subfield of companies providing critical products and services to the world's top chipmakers.
Some of them are trading at very attractive market valuations as they tend to receive less attention than their more glamorous peers, and that's an opportunity for investors.
It's possible you've never heard of Ultra Clean Holdings (NASDAQ: UCTT) or MKS Instruments (NASDAQ: MKSI), but they're fast-growing and highly profitable, and those aren't the only reasons to add them to your portfolio right now.

The case for Ultra Clean Holdings
Ultra Clean is based in California, and has been in business for over 30 years. The company is conscious of the rapid growth in demand for semiconductors triggered by the onset of advanced technologies like electric vehicles, smart homes, and the 5G network. It provides a range of products and services to make the chip manufacturing process more efficient, which is increasingly important as semiconductors become more complex.
For example, the company's ChemTrace solution identifies contamination risks in fabrication clean rooms, to help chipmakers maintain a high yield with less waste. And its QuantumClean processes prolong the life of production equipment, with fast service turnarounds to reduce potential downtime.
Ultra Clean's mechatronics segment also focuses on unlocking precision in the manufacturing process, carefully testing robots, assemblies, and systems to ensure requirements are being met for the given purpose. Automated production processes need to operate at high speeds while maintaining pinpoint accuracy, so this analysis can prevent costly issues once manufacturing goes live.
The company is on an impressive growth streak at the moment, on both the sales side and profitability side, recovering from a loss in 2019 to deliver positive earnings per share.

Analysts expect further strength in 2022, with $2.5 billion in revenue and $4.9 in earnings per share in the cards. Yet Ultra Clean stock trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of just 12, which is a 47% discount to its peers in the industry represented by the iShares Semiconductor ETF, which trades at a multiple of 23.
It implies Ultra Clean stock would need to almost double just to trade in line with the broader sector, and if it continues this run of performance, it just might.

The case for MKS Instruments
MKS Instruments is another service company with a multidecade history -- this time spanning over 60 years. It not only serves the semiconductor industry, but it also has a robust portfolio of customers in industrial technology, health science, and defense. The company describes itself as the go-to critical-problem-solving partner for advanced manufacturers.
Given the company's broad solutions, it says virtually every semiconductor chip is made with MKS products. As chips become smaller yet more powerful, producing them is growing more complex, and MKS supports manufacturers with solutions in all four phases of the chip production process. One of the challenges for chip makers is maintaining production yield while also boosting productivity, as new chemistries in advanced semiconductors require process innovations.
MKS offers multiple tools to solve these new-age problems, including infrared optical sensors, plasma sources, and process monitoring. The goal is to reduce waste, save cost, and ultimately increase output.
The company has generated strong financial results recently, but its soaring earnings per share is of particular note. It's partly attributable to a continued increase in gross profit margin from 45.2% in 2020 to 46.8% in 2021.

Analysts predict further full-year growth during 2022 in both sales and earnings, albeit at a slowing rate -- no company can near-double its profits every year forever. However, investors get the benefit of a $0.22 quarterly dividend, so MKS will pay you a return of approximately 0.75% per year to hold its stock. That's better than money in the bank in most cases.
MKS Instruments stock trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of 11, which is even cheaper than Ultra Clean Holdings, so there's a similar case for significant upside in order for MKS to trade in line with the broader semiconductor sector.

Here are some highlights from the video.
Gartner reported that the semiconductor industry grew revenue by 26% in 2021. Gartner also showed some significant changes to the top 10 semiconductor vendors by revenue compared to last year. The first significant change is the shift in the No. 1 position. Samsung Electronics has moved to the top, pushing Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) to No. 2. The second significant change is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) entering the top 10.
Intel is the only company in the top 10 that did not grow year over year. Intel saw a decline of 0.3% in revenue while others grew by double digits. Some positive news for Intel appeared on April 15 as reports emerged that Intel's 18A node is ahead of schedule by roughly six months.
Numerous articles have reported that graphics card prices are decreasing. While these prices have dropped from their peak levels, they are still above MSRP. Some investors might be fearful that this will create a slowdown for companies like AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). It might be too early to fear, as graphics cards are still selling for more than their suggested prices.

2022-04-20 00:00:00+00:00,AMD EPYC CPUs Help Mercedes-AMG F1 Team Win Pole Position,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-epyc-cpus-help-mercedes-amg-f1-team-win-pole-position,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD has helped Daimler’s DDAIF Mercedes-AMG Petronas team win pole position in F1 racing. The Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 racing team has showcased how AMD’s EPYC processors improved the company’s aerodynamics testing capacity.

In modern F1 racing, aerodynamics of the car is one of the biggest performance differentiators. One of the most important factors driving the same is Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which models and tests aerodynamics flow.

Over the years, in order to create a proper competitive environment and help smaller racing teams with limited resources have a fighting chance, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile has dictated how much CFD performance and wind tunnel time F1 teams are allowed to use.

Further, a cap on overall spending has also been sanctioned. From $145 million in 2021, the metric is likely to reduce to $140 million in 2022 and $135 million in 2023. This budget includes the money spent on CFD servers. As a result, it is extremely important to obtain the most capable processor to accurately measure CFD in a cost-effective manner.

In order to achieve this goal, AMD EPYC processors were the clear winner for Mercedes. AMD EPYC processors helped Mercedes accurately solve the CFD factor. AMD has helped the Mercedes F1 team meet the goal of faster iterative performance and cutting the time in half due to 20 percent faster compute than their previous system’s gain of 1 or 2 percent.

Partnerships and Acquisitions Remain Key Growth Factors for AMD
AMD has strengthened its position in the server market on the back of EPYC processors. The growing adoption of EPYC processors has enabled leading cloud providers like Amazon’s AMZN Amazon Web Services (AWS) to expand their AMD-powered offerings, thereby helping AMD connect with more customers.

Amazon’s AWS introduced the new Amazon EC2 Hpc6a instances in fourth-quarter 2021. AWS also launched general-purpose Amazon EC2 M6a instances.

Further, AMD's data center market is benefiting from the coronavirus crisis-triggered cloud computing boom. AMD recently announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pensando for approximately $1.9 billion before working capital and other adjustments.

AMD decided to buy Pensando to build a leading-edge data center cost-effectively without compromising security to provide the best performance to customers and intensify competition amid the industry peers. The company also completed the acquisition of Xilinx in an all-stock deal worth $35 billion.

On a combined basis, AMD and Xilinx will cater to some of the most important growth segments for the industry, including data center, gaming, PCs, communications, automotive, industrial, and aerospace and defense.

Yet, AMD is facing intense competition from NVIDIA NVDA in its data-centric business.

NVIDIA is a dominant name in the data center, professional visualization and gaming markets, wherein the company’s peers are playing a catch-up role. NVIDIA is a major competitor of AMD in the GPU market, and competition in the mobile segment has been intensifying following NVIDIA’s acquisition of ARM Holdings.

2022-04-21 00:00:00+00:00,2 No-Brainer Growth Stocks to Buy While the Market Is Down,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-no-brainer-growth-stocks-to-buy-while-the-market-is-down,"The Nasdaq Composite index is down about 13.3% year-to-date. You can bet there are several top stocks in that index that are getting unjustifiably punished in this broader market downturn that will go on to deliver great returns over the next five years. But which of those stocks should you buy today?
It takes a strong business to consistently grow revenue, but an even better one to do that while expanding operating margin. Earning a higher margin on every dollar of sales helps profits grow faster than revenue. Since stocks follow a company's long-term value over time, a company's ability to squeeze higher margins out of its operations can have a huge impact on shareholder returns. If you buy shares of companies that are showing improvement in these two numbers, you are on the way to building wealth through stocks.
Here are two growth stocks that meet these criteria that I would consider buying today.

1. Nvidia
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was one of the best-performing stocks of the last 10 years. The company had a lot of success expanding its PC graphics cards to accelerated computing applications. Areas like autonomous vehicles, robotics, data science, and anything involving artificial intelligence require immense processing power that only a graphics processing unit (GPU) can handle adequately. This has been right up Nvidia's alley, as it's been the leading supplier of desktop computer graphics for many years.
High-performance processors carry higher selling prices, and that means higher margins. Over the last three years, Nvidia's revenue has nearly doubled, while operating margin has improved roughly 10 percentage points to 37.3%. The improvement in margin fueled Nvidia's earnings per share up 190% and drove the stock higher.
NVDA Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts
With Nvidia now starting to offer software solutions in addition to chip hardware, margins should continue trending higher. The prospect of higher profits makes the stock even more attractive after falling 38% from its recent highs.
2. Apple
The 5G upgrade cycle is in full swing, and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is reaping the rewards. For the December quarter, Apple reported record iPhone revenue. While one analyst found evidence of weak demand for the cheaper iPhone SE that was released in March, overall demand for the iPhone remains strong.
The stock is down 3.8% year-to-date, which is outperforming the Nasdaq's loss of 13.3%. Apple's outperformance during this market correction could make the stock a market leader in the next bull run.
Investors must love the growth of the installed base of devices, which increased from 1.65 billion a year ago to 1.8 billion at the start of 2022. Record levels in the number of active devices are fueling demand for services, such as apps and subscriptions. Even after growing 24% year over year in the December quarter, services revenue still makes up less than 20% of Apple's business.
The great thing about this is that services generate a higher margin than sales of hardware. As Apple's revenue accelerated during the pandemic, so did its operating profit margin, which rose about five percentage points to 31% over the last four quarters.
AAPL Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts
Strong demand for the iPhone 13 is a catalyst for growing demand in Apple's higher-margin services business. A healthy upgrade cycle could grow Apple's installed base to another record high this time next year. As services revenue continues to grow, so should Apple's profitability.
Invest with a long-term mindset
No matter what happens with the stock market in the near term, owning companies that are growing and becoming more profitable should make you money over the long term.

2022-04-22 00:00:00+00:00,3 Growth Stocks Wall Street Thinks Could Gain 60% or More,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-growth-stocks-wall-street-thinks-could-gain-60-or-more,"Stock prices for highly innovative businesses are a mess right now. The benchmark iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF is down about 14% this year and many of the high-growth stocks that outperformed in the early days of the pandemic have fallen a lot further.
Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN), and Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) have been beaten down this year, but the investment bank analysts who follow these stocks think they are seriously underappreciated.
Image source: Getty Images.
In fact, the average analyst following these stocks thinks they can climb by 60% or better. Here's why the pros think they can put up some big gains.
Nvidia
Nvidia shares soared last year but the good times didn't last long. Shares of the chipmaker are down by around 38% from a peak they reached last November.
Wall Street's expecting Nvidia to bounce right back and keep on climbing higher. The consensus price target on the stock at the moment represents a 60% gain.
This former high-flyer has struggled to get off the ground this year because investors are still worried about canceled orders for consumer graphics processing units (GPUs) that occurred late last year. In addition to supply chain headaches, there probably won't be many GPUs going out to Russia or Ukraine for the foreseeable future. The hole in global demand for semiconductors that started in February could put a lot of pressure on Nvidia's quarterly results this year.
Growth could hit a speed bump in 2022 that will hardly register on a long-term timeline. Back in 2006, Nvidia introduced CUDA, a proprietary platform millions of developers use to build applications that really make the most of a GPU's parallel processing capability. New artificial intelligence applications are nearly always built to run on Nvidia GPUs because developers that demand a lot of processing power are accustomed to CUDA. Even if AMD and Intel launch a GPU with better specs than equally priced options from Nvidia, it's still hard to find developers willing to work with them.
During Nvidia's fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 30, data center revenue soared 71% year over year to $3.3 billion. With an unstoppable competitive advantage, investors can reasonably expect this stock to outperform over the long run.
DigitalOcean
DigitalOcean delivered some enormous gains in 2021 before the bottom fell out from under the stock late last year. Shares of this cloud computing platform as a service provider are down by about 65% since they hit a peak last November.
Analysts up and down Wall Street think DigitalOcean can recover a lot of its recent losses. The average analyst following the company set a target that's 67% above its price at the moment.
DigitalOcean is a cloud service provider increasingly popular among individual developers and small to medium-sized businesses that don't have large enough operations to justify going to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform. The average DigitalOcean customer spent 25% more in 2021 than in 2020, but it still worked out to a little less than $60 per client in 2021.
The war in Ukraine will pressure DigitalOcean's performance but it isn't anything the geographically diversified company can't overcome. DigitalOcean finished 2021 with around 609,000 customers in over 185 countries.
Moderna
Shares of Moderna spiked last December, but the gains didn't last long. The biotech stock has tumbled by about 70% from its peak last year.
The average Wall Street analyst who follows Moderna thinks the biotech stock is seriously underappreciated right now. The average price target on the company suggests a 66% gain could be in store for its shareholders.
Wall Street is enthusiastic about Moderna's future, and even though the company has just one drug, SpikeVax, more could be on the way. The company has plowed massive cash flows generated by its COVID-19 vaccine into a giant development pipeline.
The last time Moderna reported quarterly results it had 41 vaccine candidates in development, several of which are aimed at omicron and other variants. The company is also expanding into non-COVID diseases like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which currently lacks an effective vaccine.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has become an investor favorite over the years. Its high growth, quality products and strong cash flows have drawn in the buyers. That said, NVDA stock hasn’t traded all that well this year. On Tuesday, it’s hitting new 2022 lows — even underperforming the Nasdaq — as it leads the way lower.
That “downside leadership” started a while ago. After a strong rally in March, when Nvidia stock was powering higher alongside Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it didn’t hold support on the pullback. The same can be said for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
Now though, NVDA stock may be presenting an opportunity for long-term investors. The stock is now down 45% from the all-time high less than six months ago.
7 Consumer Stocks to Buy as the Weather Warms Up
Amid the decline, we have the stock pulling back to the 21-month moving average. This moving average was last support back in March and April 2020. We were looking for a potential test of this area a few weeks ago, wondering if Nvidia stock would fall this far. It’s also roughly where we find the 50% retracement of the long-term range. That’s as we measure from the all-time high down to the 2020 low.
NVDA Stock Chart Analysis
If the selloff continues, we can’t eliminate the potential return to the mid-$170s, followed by a potential test of the 61.8% retracement near $160. The latter is a larger target than the mid-$170s.

On the upside, NVDA stock needs to reclaim $195, then $208 to $210. Above the latter could open the door to $225-plus, potentially putting the 200-day moving average in play.
The analysts continue to support this name too. Even when they are cutting their price targets, it still represents significant upside in the stock price. Just this week, Credit Suisse even assigned a $400 price target on NVDA stock. If it were to get there, it would represent more than 100% upside from current levels.
Why are they bullish? The same reason that I remain a long-term bull, which is that Nvidia’s products remain in constant demand. Surely, this demand can fluctuate due to the economy, but by and large, demand continues to grow. That’s because Nvidia caters to so many long-term secular growth industries. We’re talking about cloud computing, data centers, artificial intelligence and machine learning, the metaverse, gaming, autonomous driving and electric vehicles, robotics, drones and so on.
These industries will continue to experience strong demand over the long term and thus, NVDA stock is one we want to own for the long term. Down almost 50% from the highs seems like a good place to begin buying for long-term investors.

2022-04-27 00:00:00+00:00,Qualcomm forecasts upbeat revenue as diversification bet pays off,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/qualcomm-forecasts-upbeat-revenue-as-diversification-bet-pays-off-0,"By Chavi Mehta and Jane Lanhee Lee
April 27 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O forecast third-quarter revenue above analyst expectations after beating second quarter revenue and profit estimates on Wednesday, largely due its move to focus on a growing non-handset business to cushion a likely hit from slowing smartphone demand.
The strong earnings outlook and record quarterly revenue for the last quarter immediately pushed Qualcomm shares up about 5% in after-hours trading.
Lockdowns in China, war in Ukraine and rising inflation has taken a toll on consumers, preventing them from spending on electronic gadgets like phones. However, Qualcomm remained cushioned from this as the premium smartphone market, where Qualcomm is the leader, was not as impacted by slowing demand as lower-priced phones, Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon told Reuters.
To reduce its dependence on handsets, Qualcomm has been diversifying its revenue streams by catering to other markets including automotive, and that strategy has been a success so far, Amon said.
Increased adoption of 5G and cloud-based applications has helped Qualcomm, which makes chips that enable devices to connect to mobile data networks as well as wireless networks. Qualcomm also launched the latest version of its flagship chipset brand Snapdragon during the second quarter.
Revenue from chips catering to automotive and internet-powered gadgets rose 41% and 61%, respectively, during the second quarter, while revenue from its mainstay handset business rose 56%, thanks to the new Snapdragon launch.
Moreover, Qualcomm is weighing the impact of slowly losing business from Apple AAPL.O by taking advantage of the gap left by Huawei in the China smartphone market by fulfilling chip needs of Chinese brands like Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, especially for high-end phones.
The company forecast current-quarter revenue between the range of $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $9.98 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Adjusted revenue for the quarter ended March 27 was $11.16 billion, above estimates of $10.6 billion.
Excluding items, Qualcomm earned $3.21 per share, beating estimates of $2.91 per share.

2022-04-28 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) Q1 Earnings and Revenues Beat Estimates,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-q1-earnings-and-revenues-beat-estimates,"Intel (INTC) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.87 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.80 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.39 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8.75%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this world's largest chipmaker would post earnings of $0.90 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.09, delivering a surprise of 21.11%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.
Intel, which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, posted revenues of $18.35 billion for the quarter ended March 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.18%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $19.67 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Intel shares have lost about 12.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -12.2%.
What's Next for Intel?
While Intel has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Intel: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.85 on $18.39 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.48 on $75.31 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor - General is currently in the top 8% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
Another stock from the same industry, Nvidia (NVDA), has yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2022. The results are expected to be released on May 25.
This maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +40.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
Nvidia's revenues are expected to be $8.11 billion, up 43.3% from the year-ago quarter.

2022-04-29 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Is Falling Today,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-is-falling-today,"What happened
Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were sliding today on no company-specific news. Instead, investors are likely processing comments about supply chain issues in the chip market that Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) management mentioned on the company's conference call yesterday.
The tech stock was down by 1.9% as of 11:42 a.m. ET.
So what
Intel beat Wall Street's expectations for both the top- and bottom-line estimates in the first quarter, but the company's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, highlighted some persistent problems in the semiconductor space that Nvidia investors latched on to.
Image source: Getty Images.
First, Gelsinger said that ""component supply constraints continue to be a challenge with the most recent COVID lockdowns in Shanghai further increasing supply chain risk and contributing to inflationary pressures that are having a negative impact"" on the company's PC total addressable market.
China has implemented a strict zero-COVID policy that has resulted in cities being shut down when coronavirus cases pop up, which has slowed down some chip production for companies.
Adding to Nvidia investors' concerns is the fact that Gelsinger expects more pain ahead.
""The chip shortage cost the U.S. economy $240 billion last year and we expect the industry will continue to see challenges until at least 2024 in areas like foundry capacity and tool availability,"" he said on Intel's latest earnings call.
Now what
Nvidia investors clearly weren't happy to see these comments about the chip market today, and they come as the tech company's share price has already tumbled 22% over the past six months.
Nvidia's shareholders will get a better picture of how the company is doing when Nvidia reports its first-quarter results on May 25. But with the semiconductor market currently experiencing supply chain issues and Nvidia's peers seeing ongoing issues in this space, Nvidia investors may want to prepare for some more share price swings ahead.

By David French
May 2 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed a seesaw session higher on Monday, as investors bought in to technology names in the last hour of trading amid bets they had been overly beaten down ahead of this week's Federal Reserve meeting.
The gathering of U.S. central bank policymakers is widely expected to raise interest rates by half a percentage point, with this week's move expected to kick off a period of aggressive rate hikes to counter inflation.
Nervousness heading into the meeting was reflected in a topsy-turvy session for U.S. equities. After positive moves to start the day, the S&P 500 fell to its lowest intraday point since May 2021, and the Nasdaq touched a level last seen in November 2020.
The jitters were also seen in the market for U.S. Treasuries, where the ten-year benchmark breached 3% for the first time in more than three years.
As well as positioning themselves for the expected rate hike, traders were also looking to the launch of ""quantitative tightening,"" where the central bank reduces its balance sheet after buying bonds to support the economy during the pandemic.
However, earlier declines were used as a buying opportunity by some in the latter part of the session to drag all three indexes into positive territory.
""We're at a point in the market now where so much of it, across various sectors, is beaten down,"" said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer of Defiance ETF.
""I think the market has priced in what the Fed will be able to do, so my sense - as someone who likes to look for long-term opportunities - is that this is the land of opportunity right now.""
Jablonski pointed to megacap technology names, which stand to remain key parts of the economy for years to come, as being ""on sale"".
High-growth stocks such as tech have been pummeled this year as a result of traders adjusting for the higher interest-rate environment, with losses accentuated in recent days by a number of disappointing earnings reports.
However, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc FB.O climbed 5.3% on Monday after falling 9.8% last month. Nvidia Corp NVDA.O also jumped 5.3%, while Microsoft Corp MSFT.O gained 2.5%, after sharp declines in April.
After spending much of the day in the red, Tesla Inc TSLA.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Apple Inc AAPL.O all ended between 0.2% and 3.7% higher.
Apple had been weighed down for much of Monday as the iPhone maker faced a possible hefty fine after EU antitrust regulators charged it with restricting rivals' access to its technology used for mobile wallets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 84.29 points, or 0.26%, to 33,061.5, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 23.45 points, or 0.57%, to 4,155.38 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 201.38 points, or 1.63%, to 12,536.02.
Of the 11 S&P sectors, communications services .SPLRCL was the biggest advancer of the six indexes that gained. Real estate .SPLRCR led decliners.
Pfizer Inc PFE.N fell 1.5% after a large trial found its COVID-19 oral antiviral treatment Paxlovid was not effective at preventing coronavirus infections in people living with someone infected with the virus.
Activision Blizzard ATVI.O climbed 3.3% after Warren Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N has taken a 9.5% stake in the ""Call of Duty"" game maker.
Spirit Airlines SAVE.N slid 9.4% after the ultra low-cost carrier rejected JetBlue Airways Corp's JBLU.O $33-per-share takeover offer, saying it had a low likelihood of winning approval from government regulators.
By comparison, JetBlue ended 2.6% higher, regaining ground lost during a midday wobble that had wiped out initial gains.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.22 billion shares, compared with the 11.87 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week high and 52 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 26 new highs and 503 new lows.

2022-05-03 00:00:00+00:00,The Ryder System and Carvana have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-ryder-system-and-carvana-have-been-highlighted-as-zacks-bull-and-bear-of-the-day,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – May 3, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Ryder System Inc. R as the Bull of the Day and Carvana Co. CVNA asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Advanced Micro Devices AMD, ON Semiconductor ON, and Nvidia Corporation NVDA.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
Bull of the Day:
Ryder System Inc. isn't seeing a slowdown in logistics. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) recently reported a record first quarter.
Ryder is a nearly $10 billion global logistics and transportation company. It provides supply chain, dedicated transportation and fleet management solutions to some of the top consumer brands, including the top 10 Fortune 500 food and beverage companies in the United States.
Big Beat in the First Quarter
On Apr 27, Ryder reported its first quarter 2022 results and blew by the Zacks Consensus by $1.21. Earnings were $3.59 versus the Zacks Consensus of just $2.38. It was the 5th consecutive earnings beat in a row.
It saw record first quarter results with all three of its business segments seeing double digit revenue growth.
Fleet Management Systems (""FMS"") was up 22% to $2.2 billion versus $1.8 billion last year. Supply Chain Solutions (""SCS"") jumped 10% to $1.28 billion from $1.16 billion in 2021.
Dedicated Transportation Solutions (""DTS"") saw better-than-expected results gaining 25% to $296 million from $237 million.
Results exceeded expectations due to used vehicle sales and rental. Ryder generated record REO of 25% due to truck capacity constraints in the market, which benefited Fleet Management Systems, and from its continued ongoing initiatives to increase returns.
It's strategy to accelerate growth in SCS and DTS is paying off as they now represent approximately 50% of the company's revenue, up from 40% three years ago. Ryder anticipates the growth to continue in these two segments.
Previously announced SCS acquisitions are also performing well and are providing Ryder with enhanced capabilities in the fast-growing e-commerce fulfillment and multi-client warehousing.
Price increases were used to address ""unusually high"" labor cost increases. However, Ryder still expects SCS and DTS to achieve their high single-digit earnings targets in the second half.
Raised Full Year Earnings Guidance
Given the big beat in the first quarter, and continued bullish outlook in the logistics industry, it's not surprising that Ryder raised its full year earnings estimates.
It now expects 2022 earnings between $13.00 and $14.00 per share, up from prior guidance of $11.00 to $12.00.
4 estimates have been revised higher over the last week pushing the Zacks Consensus up to $13.49 from $11.70. That's earnings growth of 40.8% as Ryder made just $9.58 last year.
Shares Are Dirt Cheap
Like many stocks in 2022, Ryder shares are weak. They've fallen 13.8% year-to-date, which is similar to the decline of the S&P 500.
This has created a buying opportunity, however, as it's now dirt cheap.
Ryder trades with a forward P/E of just 5.2.
It also pays a dividend currently yielding a juicy 3.3%.
For investors looking for a value stock with rising earning estimates, Ryder should be on your short list.
Bear of the Day:
Carvana Co. shocks the Street after reporting a wider-than-expected loss in the first quarter. The earnings estimates on this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) have been slashed in the last 30 days.
Carvana operates a website, Carvana.com, which provides a platform for people to buy, sell and finance cars. The car can be delivered to the customer or picked up at one of the automated Car Vending Machines. It provides as-soon-as-next-day delivery to customers in over 300 markets.
Big Miss in Q1
On Apr 20, Carvana reported its first quarter results and missed on the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 68%. Earnings were a loss of $2.89 versus the Zacks Consensus of a loss of $1.72.
It was Carvana's third miss in a row.
While revenue rose 56% to $3.5 billion, total gross profit was just $298 million, a decrease of 12%.
The company's net loss also widened to $506 million, an increase from $82 million a year ago.
Carvana called this quarter ""challenging"" and said it was due to events impacting the used vehicle industry as a whole, such as Omicron, used vehicle prices, interest rates, but also to events specific to Carvana, including reconditioning and logistics network disruptions.
It said that it considers these macro factors to be transitory.
No Longer Providing Guidance for the Full Year
But what really hit the stock was the decision to no longer provide specific numeric near-term guidance for the remainder of the year.
Carvana blamed its decision on the current industry trends impacting customer affordability including high used vehicle prices, rapid movements in interest rates, rapid increases in fuel prices and other macroeconomic uncertainty impacting the used vehicle market.
Analysts Slash Full Year Earnings Estimates
8 estimates were cut for the full year in the last 30 days. That has pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate down to a loss of $6.27 from a loss of $2.12 just 60 days ago.
That's a decline of 284% as Carvana lost just $1.63 last year.
Shares Plunge
Carvana shares were already falling heading into the first quarter earnings report. But they're now down 72% year-to-date and are near their 52-week low.
Are shares a deal?
Wall Street isn't looking favorably on companies that don't have positive earnings and who are no longer providing guidance this year.
For those investors interested in auto retailers, perhaps look at the old-fashioned brick and mortar auto retailers, some of which reported record first quarter reports this year.

Can AMD Shares Return to Their Former Glory?
Stocks tumbled again last Friday to close out a tough week in the market. To put it simply, it was a pretty brutal April month all around. Perhaps, the old saying ""April showers bring May flowers"" can be valid for the investing world and bring us a prosperous month.
It's a fresh week. Investors will be pivoting their focus to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) announcement on Wednesday; the consensus is that the Fed will be raising rates by 50 basis points. While this rate hike is critical, the real focus will be on what the Fed plans moving forward in the summer meetings.
In the meantime, earnings season rolls on. We've witnessed adverse market reactions to quarterly releases, which is usually not the case. Economic concerns and geopolitical issues have undoubtedly weighed heavily on investor sentiment.
On deck to report quarterly results tomorrow after the market closes is the big semiconductor player Advanced Micro Devices.
It's been a tough stretch in the semiconductor space. AMD has had the worst 2022 performance, followed closely by NVDA. In fact, none of the companies have managed to even come close to the S&P 500's performance. The semiconductor shortage has added fuel to this fire sale.  
Stretching out the time frame over the past year, we can see that nearly all three companies' shares took a downwards trajectory around December 2021. Though 2022 hasn't been kind, all three companies have managed to outpace the S&P 500 thanks to their nearly year-long run in 2022.
Previous Share Reactions
AMD has exceeded EPS estimates over its last six quarterly reports. However, the share price has only moved upwards twice over this timeframe; shares rose 7.5% following its latest earnings release and 6.6% in its July 2021 earnings release. The company's four-quarter trailing average EPS surprise sits at a respectable 17%.
When share price rallied following the quarterly reports, AMD exceeded EPS expectations by at least 20% in both instances. To me, it seems an extensive EPS beat may be needed to fuel another rally for shares. Additionally, with the weakness in the semiconductor space throughout 2022, investors will most likely react adversely to any EPS or revenue miss.
Q4 2021 Earnings
AMD reported quarterly record revenue of $4.8 billion in its latest earnings report, up 49% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. It also had robust quarterly profitability; gross margin was 50%, and operating income tallied $1.2 billion.
In its computing and graphics segment, revenue was up 32% year-over-year, driven by its RyzenTM and RadeonTM processor sales. Within the company's enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment, revenue tallied $2.2 billion, boosted by higher EPYCTM and semi-custom processor sales.
AMD witnessed strong demand for premium desktop and notebook PCs built with their impressive Ryzen 5000 processors and announced new Ryzen processors with AMD 3D V-Cache technology to power an unparalleled gaming experience. Additionally, AMD had a higher average selling price for its products throughout the quarter, driven by a richer mix of Ryzen processor and Radeon product sales.
Moving forward, AMD expects robust demand across both segments due to its cutting-edge technology and its established stance in the booming gaming industry. Furthermore, the company is benefitting majorly from the digital shift we've undergone since COVID-19 took the world by storm.
EPS & Revenue Estimates
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q1 earnings sits at $0.91 per share, reflecting stellar earnings growth in the double-digits at 75% from the year-ago quarter. Additionally, the Consensus Estimate trend has remained unchanged over the last 60 days, though one analyst recently upgraded their quarterly estimate. Notably, zero analysts have downgraded their estimates in this timeframe.
Q1 sales estimates are looking strong as well; the $5 billion consensus revenue estimate represents a sizable top-line expansion of 45% from the year-ago quarter. Additionally, AMD provided uplifting revenue guidance for 2022, held down by robust growth across all businesses.
ON Semiconductor & Nvidia Comparison
ON Semiconductor is a leading supplier of power and analog semiconductors and sensors. Before the market opened today, ON reported its quarterly results; the company reported EPS of $1.22 and quarterly revenue of $1.9 billion, fueling shares to gain nearly 4% in the pre-market session.
Nvidia Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit (GPU). The Zacks Consensus Estimate Trend for NVDA's upcoming quarter has retraced marginally over the last 60 days, now displaying quarterly earnings of $1.29 per share.
Nvidia's quarterly EPS estimate displays a notable 43% year-over-year growth in earnings, and the $8.1 billion consensus revenue estimate easily beats out NVDA's year-ago quarterly sales of $5.6 billion by close to 45%.
These semiconductor companies are still posting and forecasting strong year-over-year growth rates, which bodes well for AMD heading into tomorrow.  
Bottom Line
A highly unanticipated level of demand for microchips during the pandemic caused the supply chain to fall completely out of equilibrium. Blending the chip shortage into a volatile market environment with rising borrowing rates and surging energy costs has undoubtedly fueled the poor 2022 share performance.  
However, microchips are a staple in our everyday lives, whether we realize it or not. Nearly every piece of technology requires a microchip to function correctly, and this trend isn't going anywhere anytime soon as we continuously become more dependent on them.
Quarterly estimates and year-over-year growth rates are looking solid. This, paired with AMD's strong demand across nearly all products, gives me an optimistic view of the company heading into its quarterly release. It is important that investors are aware of current market sentiment, as a robust earnings does not guarantee anything as we've seen so far in 2022. Still, semiconductor companies will benefit massively in the long-term.
AMD is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an overall VGM Score of an A.

May 4 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq slipped on Wednesday as growth stocks lost ground, while banks gained ahead of a Federal Reserve policy decision expected to result in the biggest interest rate hike since 2000.

Traders are pricing in expectations of a 50 basis points (bps) rate hike and the start of reductions to the U.S. central bank's $9 trillion balance sheet when the Fed releases its statement at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT).
The spotlight will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's news conference for fresh clues on how far and how fast the central bank is prepared to go in an effort to bring down decades-high inflation.
""The (50 bps hike) is baked into the market. What maybe isn't is what's the eventual end point here,"" said Josh Wein, portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds.
""The market is still adjusting to this inflation story and the need for the Fed to be proactive ... it's easy to lose sight of the fact that companies are in very good shape in aggregate and several rate hikes do not undo that dynamic.""
Concerns about a hit to economic growth due to a hawkish Fed, mixed earnings from some big growth companies, the conflict in Ukraine and pandemic-related lockdowns in China have hammered Wall Street recently, with richly valued growth stocks bearing the brunt of the sell-off.
Bearish sentiment, or expectations that stock prices will fall over the next six months, rose sharply to 59.4% in the latest survey by the American Association of Individual Investors. The last time bearish sentiment went above that level was in March 2009 during the financial crisis.

2022-05-05 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting NVDA Put And Call Options For June 24th,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-nvda-put-and-call-options-for-june-24th,"Investors in NVIDIA Corp (Symbol: NVDA) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 24th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the NVDA options chain for the new June 24th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $185.00 strike price has a current bid of $16.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $185.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $168.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of NVDA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $188.27/share today.
Because the $185.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.86% return on the cash commitment, or 64.71% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for NVIDIA Corp, and highlighting in green where the $185.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $195.00 strike price has a current bid of $14.95. If an investor was to purchase shares of NVDA stock at the current price level of $188.27/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $195.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.52% if the stock gets called away at the June 24th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if NVDA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for NVIDIA Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing NVDA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $195.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $195.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.94% boost of extra return to the investor, or 57.97% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $188.27) to be 53%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

When will the Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) free fall end?
AMD stock is down 37% already, so it should find suitors.
This should be an opportunity to accumulate AMD stock for the long term.
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock fell 6% yesterday. But I’ll argue today that it’s not through any specific fault of its own. My long-term prognosis for AMD stock is still optimal. Short term, we can remain on guard, but there aren’t any internal issues that need fixing. Firs, Thursday was a painful day for all of Wall Street not just AMD. Wednesday’s jubilation after the FOMC meeting, turned into a bull funeral. The bears came back with a vengeance and completely demolished investors the next day.
Secondly, the chip sector is already reeling from shortages and backlogs. The effects of locking down the world for Covid-19 still linger. The 2020 disruption has caught up with the manufacturers and is creating serious bottlenecks. The tech sector is feeling this more than most other industries. Regardless, AMD has managed to compensate and adapt judging by the reports so far.
Ticker Company Current Price
AMD Advanced Micro Devices $93.87
Supply Chain Issues Are Partly to Blame
Despite the abysmal sourcing conditions, AMD has continued to deliver strong results. Management reported earnings this week and the stock rallied for good reason. AMD grew sales 71% and earnings 117%, leaving no doubt over the quality of the team. The drop yesterday merely brings AMD back to its pre-earnings base.
With such blowout numbers, the opinions are almost unanimously positive. I found one price target downgrade, but it was from $165 to $150, so it’s not an issue. According to Yahoo Finance, AMD needs to rally more than 40% before it reaches its average price target.
7 Transportation Stocks to Avoid During These Trying Times
This month there are challenges from the Federal Reserve fears. There is also the matter of the old Wall Street adage of sell in May and go away. But, in the long term, these are mere temporary hiccups. There are technical challenges as long as it’s under $102 per share. But there are support zones below and would find footing with the markets.
Meanwhile, the downside now creates opportunities for new investors. Under the leadership of Lisa Su AMD stock continues to shine. The financial metrics are beyond reproach from all aspects. Although Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is still larger and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) much flashier, AMD is a star.
Management more than tripled revenues and net income in just five years. Regardless, AMD managed to hold its valuation at a reasonable level. In fact, it is 30% cheaper than its rival NVDA. Even from an absolute basis it’s on par with similar fast growing companies.
AMD Stock Belongs On All Stock Shopping Lists
Source: Charts by TradingView
The company’s earnings report should give investors confidence in AMD. The company beat expectations and forecast a strong outlook despite the current challenges it faces. The team is executing well on plans and not hiding behind excuses. The field is competitive, but they are a top contender with plenty of room to prosper.
All aspects of their businesses are growing, and the trend is not about to fade. Demand will remain strong for a decade as we digitize the world. There are new applications coming up constantly, so AMD will be busy. The move to the metaverse alone could fuel a new kind of tech application. It doesn’t take a wild imagination to see AMD prosper under such scenarios.
Retail investors would do well to form their own opinions of AMD stock. When the bullish thesis is this obvious we don’t need the experts. Wall Street tends to complicate things with cryptic ratings. Here is a clear main street statement: If the markets are higher in the future, then so is AMD!

2022-05-09 00:00:00+00:00,2 Top Tech Stocks to Buy During a Recession,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-top-tech-stocks-to-buy-during-a-recession-3,"The market downdraft continues to pull down the tech sector. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 1,000 points the other day, a 1.4% drop, but it caused the tech-laden Nasdaq 100 to plummet over 2%, putting virtually every single one of its components in the red. After a 30-year bull run that saw the Nasdaq 100 index gain nearly 4,000%, the tech benchmark could be heading for a deeper run south.
The economy itself may be primed for a recession. The Federal Reserve made the first of what it promises could be three big half-percentage-point interest hikes in the hopes of taming inflation, and the market is reportedly tumbling over fear it won't be enough.

That fear is probably not unfounded. St. Louis Fed president James Bullard said it's a ""fantasy"" to believe the worst inflation the country has experienced in 40 years is going to be cured by half-measures, indicating aggressive interest rate hikes will be needed, even if it causes economic growth to stop. With the country's gross domestic product contracting 1.4% in the first quarter, that time may be at hand.
The simple solution would be to pull your money out of the market and wait till it all blows over, but that's not a strategy that would serve you well over the long haul. Because stock market corrections are invariably followed by bull markets, missing the upturn means you'll miss the gains. And since it's never clear when the market is going to go up (just like now, people are still trying to figure out if it's really going to head down), the odds are high you will miss the bottom.
Buying a basket of good companies and committing to holding them for many years is the surest way to generate market-beating returns, even among battered tech stocks (maybe especially in battered tech stocks). The following two tech stocks are an excellent place to begin.

Nvidia
There is arguably no better tech stock to hold long-term than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which is poised to capitalize on all the major trends in the sector. It has its fingers in gaming, data centers, artificial intelligence, automobiles, and cryptocurrencies. Its powerful processors are used in everything from weather simulation and gene sequencing to deep learning and robotics.
It was just hit by the SEC with a $5.5 million fine for underplaying the role crypto mining played in its gaming division sales in 2018, since miners were converting its gaming processors into crypto mining units and Nvidia failed to disclose the boost that provided.
Since then, however, the chipmaker has halved the hash rate of its GeForce RTX 3060 processors, limiting their efficiency, and developed a separate crypto-focused chip, the CMP, or Cryptocurrency Mining Processor. It ended up generating $550 million in CMP revenue last year, though that's volatile and depends on what's happening in the crypto markets.
Gaming and data centers are the chipmaker's two largest segments, with a combined $23 billion in sales, some 60% more than the year before. Both segments are still rapidly growing, and will be for years to come.
Nvidia's stock is down 36% year-to-date, and analysts see it growing earnings at a near-31% rate every year for the next five years. While it will experience hiccups from time to time, it's a stock that should be a long-term keeper.

Verizon
Verizon (NYSE: VZ) stock is not down as much as Nvidia's in 2022 (it's off about 8% at this writing), and it also has superior long-term potential. The telecom stock recently suffered one of its worst weeks in recent memory after its earnings report showed a continued loss of subscribers, causing it to suggest full-year adjusted earnings will come in at the low end of its prior guidance.
Yet there's a lot to be optimistic about. Customer losses were significantly lower than expected, just 36,000 postpaid wireless phone subscribers versus analyst expectations of a 75,000 loss, and the rollout of 5G network ensures it will enjoy profitable growth for the long term.
Verizon owns the most spectrum in the sub-6 gigahertz range, where 5G will initially be deployed, and it is the leader in millimeter-wave spectrum, the destination to which the industry is ultimately heading. It's been years since network speeds were increased, and the 5G deployment promises significant upside.
Verizon is no longer a growth stock in the same way Nvidia is. With 91.4 million postpaid phone connections, 23.8 million prepaid connections, and $134 billion in annual sales, the telecom is the largest wireless provider in the U.S. It's hard to get the giddy-up going again in a business that big. But what it is is a steady grower, and one that pays a dividend that is currently yielding 5.45% annually.
It's made a payout every year since going public in 2020. Before that it traded as Bell Atlantic, which was one of the so-called ""Baby Bells"" resulting from the breakup of AT&T, and dividend payments under that banner have stretched back for well more than 100 years. It's raised the dividend every year since 2006.
It's likely going to be around for at least another 100 years, and should be a staple of an investor's buy-and-hold portfolio.

2022-05-10 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel launches new AI chips, challenging Nvidia's market",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-launches-new-ai-chips-challenging-nvidias-market,"By Steven Scheer and Jane Lanhee Lee
JERUSALEM/SAN FRANCISCO, May 10 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O on Tuesday launched a new chip called Gaudi2 focused on artificial intelligence computing, as the chip manufacturer makes a bigger push into the AI chip market currently dominated by Nvidia Corp NVDA.O.
Gaudi2 is the second generation processor by Habana Labs, an Israeli AI chip startup Intel bought in late 2019 for about $2 billion. AI chip startups have been getting huge investments in recent years as AI computing is one of the fastest growing areas for data centers.
Prying market share away from Nvidia has been a challenge as many AI researchers and companies have been accustomed to using Nvidia’s software platform CUDA. So in addition to new chips for AI computing, Intel told Reuters it has been focusing on its software development.
“CUDA is not a moat that Nvidia can really stand on for long,” said chief business officer at Habana Labs Eitan Medina, adding that Intel’s software platform is open standard, free to download and use from GitHub, the software development site. “Now the question is who can do the work efficiently?”
Medina said the Gaudi2 was twice as fast as Habana's previous AI chip and manufactured at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s 2330.TW 7-nanometer transistor technology from 16-nanometers previously. Generally the smaller the transistor size, the faster and more powerful the chip is.
Intel also launched a new chip called Greco for inferencing work: taking an AI algorithm and making a prediction or identifying an object.
Sandra Rivera, who heads Intel's data center and AI, said the AI chip market is estimated to grow some 25% a year in the next five years to reach around $50 billion. ""We intend to invest and innovate to lead this market,” she said, adding that increasingly the investments will be in software, both for expanding Intel's team and buying other companies.

On Monday, May 9, some popular names were down over 9%. Today's video focuses on recent news affecting Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). Here are some highlights.
Intel has recently entered the discrete graphics card market with its Arc Alchemist gaming cards. In the first quarter of 2022, it released Arc to various laptops, and in the second quarter of 2022, it was supposed to release graphics cards for the desktop market. Unfortunately, the desktop graphics cards have been pushed to the summer of 2022, and laptops with Arc are very hard to find as it seems there is a very low supply.
Intel is also entering the high-performance computing market with its Ponte Vecchio graphics card. During Intel's earnings call, management confirmed that it had started testing the product with customers. Intel has not shown much revenue growth in the past, but maybe this new market could be the catalyst that triggers growth for the company.
On May 6, the SEC charged Nvidia with a $5.5 million fine due to Nvidia providing inadequate disclosures about the impact of crypto mining on its revenue. The penalties were for two 10-Q forms for its fiscal year 2018, where Nvidia did not disclose that its gaming business sales were driven significantly by crypto mining.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has not sidestepped the disaster we have in tech stocks. NVDA stock is hitting fresh lows on Thursday, despite a solid bounce in many growth stocks. With shares down more than 54% from the high, it’s time to start taking a closer look at its fundamentals.
There are legitimate fears about PC demand and a global recession. Those fears may be true, but so are the realities. Realities like the strong earnings reports we have seen from the semiconductor industry over the last several weeks. More specific to Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) just reported a top- and bottom-line beat with a better-than-expected outlook.
These types of reports are hard to dismiss — even though the market is doing just that right now.
Further, we know that the cyclical part of the economy could struggle. However, the secular part should be just fine and that’s exactly the end-market that Nvidia deals with. You know: Cloud-computing, datacenters, gaming, artificial intelligence and machine learning, drones, robotics, autonomous driving, supercomputing, graphics and design, etc.
These markets are not going to disappear overnight and there will be consistent demand for Nvidia for the rest of this decade. That’s true even if there isn’t demand for NVDA stock at the moment.
7 Safe Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Now
This is one of the few companies that, short of a change in its business, I just cannot turn long-term bearish on. Despite the turmoil in the market, analysts still expect 30% revenue growth and 27% earnings growth this year. That doesn’t exactly spell disaster to me.

As far as the charts are concerned, we were a bit early on our long call in the low $290s. That said, we saved ourselves almost $100 a share by not rushing into NVDA stock in March.
We’re now trading down into a potential area of interest. It’s the 61.8% retracement as measured from the November 2021 high down to the March 2020 Covid-19 low. The prior breakout zone near $145 to $155 is also nearby, along with the 161.8% downside extension of the smaller six-month range.
Does that mean NVDA stock is at or near a bottom? No, it does not!
It means that the stock is trading down into a prior area of interest and for those with a long-term objective, accumulating some shares is not the worst idea with Nvidia down about 55% from the high.
Note that “accumulating” would not suggest an all-in back-up-the-truck type of allocation. Because if support does fail to materialize here — or if it does but NVDA stock later moves lower — we could be looking at a test of the $110 to $120 area.

2022-05-13 00:00:00+00:00,1 Reason Why Nvidia Stock Is Rising Today,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-reason-why-nvidia-stock-is-rising-today,"What happened
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shareholders were in for a pleasant surprise Friday as the semiconductor maker made significant gains. As of 1:05 p.m. ET, Nvidia's share price had surged by 9.8% as investors became more bullish about the market in general. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up by nearly 4% at that point in the session.
So what
There's no clear reason why the broader market -- and Nvidia's shares -- are rebounding Friday, but it's likely that after the pummeling that technology stocks have received over the past several months, some investors think the sector is ripe for a comeback.
Image source: Getty Images.
Investors have been distancing themselves from high-growth technology stocks over the past six months as soaring inflation and a big shift in the Federal Reserve's fiscal policy have spurred fears of a potential economic slowdown.
But investors appear to be shrugging off some of those concerns Friday, perhaps in the hope that tech stocks have nearly reached their bottom.
Now what
The broader market's rally Friday -- and Nvidia's share price pop, too -- are great to see. But investors should stay clear-eyed about what's happening in the market.
Investors, in general, have been digesting news of the first few interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in years, and they're also factoring in a series of upcoming rate hikes that will likely come throughout 2022 and 2023. With U.S. inflation at levels not seen in nearly 40 years, Americans are growing pessimistic, and even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that he can't guarantee the central bank's ability to engineer a so-called soft landing for the economy while it's striving to get inflation back in check.
So while Nvidia's price bounce is great, long-term investors should be prepared for more oscillations from this tech stock.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD), and Pfizer Inc. (PFE). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
 
You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>
  Shares of NVIDIA have been hit hard during the ongoing market downdraft, as sentiment has shifted on high-multiple and fast-growth operators in a rising interest rate environment. The stock is down -40.4% in the year-to-date period vs. -23j.9% decline for the Zacks semiconductor industry and -15.8% pullback for the broader S&P 500 index. The Zacks analyst believes that the company should continue to benefit from strong growth in GeForce desktop and notebook Graphic Processing Units, which is boosting gaming revenues. Moreover, a surge in Hyperscale demand remains a tailwind for the company’s Data Center business. NVIDIA's quarterly report next week (May 25th) is expected to spotlight these areas for strength. 
  Expansion of NVIDIA GeForce NOW is expected to drive user base. Further, solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions is a boon. Additionally, collaboration with Mercedes-Benz is expected to further strengthen NVIDIA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, management expects COVID-19 pandemic to negatively impact near-term revenues. Moreover, the U.S.-China trade war remains a key concern.

  The Home Depot shares have lost -28.1% of their value in the year-to-date period against Lowe's -24.7% decline and -15.8% decline in the S&P 500 index. Driving this weakness is the perception of rougher days ahead for the housing sector in a rising mortgage rate environment that is expected to weigh on home affordability measures. While these issues are real, the Zacks analyst is pointing to continued strength in both Pro and DIY categories as well as digital momentum, along with strong demand for home-improvement projects, robust housing market trends, and ongoing investments.
  Its interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have helped consistently boost web traffic for the past few quarters, aiding digital sales. The Zacks analyst expects these favorable trends to to be on display in the company's quartelry report on Tuesday, May 17th. 
  (You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>>)

Shares of Pfizer have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+29.2% vs. +19.6%). The company boasts a diversified portfolio of innovative drugs and vaccines including Ibrance and Prevnar. The Zacks analyst believes that no company is as strongly placed in the COVID vaccines/treatment market as Pfizer right now. Its COVID-19 vaccine has become a key contributor to the top line. The vaccine together with Pfizer’s promising oral antiviral pill for COVID-19, Paxlovid is expected to generate a combined $54 billion in sales in 2022.
  Pfizer boasts a sustainable pipeline with multiple late-stage programs that can drive growth. However, currency headwinds and pricing pressure are key top-line headwinds. Concerns remain about its long-term growth drivers beyond its COVID-related products due to competitive pressure.

2022-05-17 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Shot Higher on Tuesday,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-shot-higher-on-tuesday,"What happened
Down Thursday, up Friday, down Monday -- seesawing semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) played true to form on Tuesday, rising once again, and this time by a pretty significant number, closing the day up 5.3%.
Curiously, however, the news wasn't all good for Nvidia today.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Tuesday did start off well for Nvidia stock, with investment bank Piper Sandler saying it is ""moving to a more positive stance"" on semiconductor stocks in general, after making some pessimistic comments about the sector two weeks ago.
On the one hand, rumblings of weakness in PC sales and worries over whether GPU demand can hold up in the context of a crypto sell-off, combined with more general concerns about rising interest rates and inflation, have investors feeling nervous about semiconductor growth estimates. On the other hand, this caution is now already ""mostly priced into stocks at current level,"" explains TheFly.com in a note today discussing Piper's report.
As a result, Nvidia stock has given up 40% of its market cap since the start of this year. (And not only Nvidia. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) stock is down 32%, Qualcomm has lost 25%, and even Intel is down 15%.) This has Piper Sandler thinking that much of the risk may have been squeezed out of this sector already, and I suspect it's right about that.
Now what
That's the good news. The bad news is that, after running valuations across the semiconductor sector, Piper Sandler concluded today that only three chip stocks (including AMD but not including Nvidia) qualify as ""top picks.""
The other bad news is that, according to a new report from TechRadar, Piper may be right to prefer AMD over Nvidia stock. As the tech news site reports, AMD has introduced two new ""Radeon DNA 2"" graphics processing chips and is producing them in sufficient quantities to keep them in stock for consumers to buy -- ensuring their prices don't get inflated much past MSRP. This not only makes AMD's GPUs more competitive with Nvidia on price. It also gives AMD a greater chance of making a sale in cases where an agnostic consumer goes shopping and finds Nvidia chips out of stock, but AMD chips well supplied.
TechRadar further notes that, in general, GPU prices appear to be coming back down as the global semiconductor chip shortage of 2021 begins to fade here halfway through 2022. As supply and demand start to come back into balance, the cyclical semiconductor industry may be shifting back into a battle for market share -- and a price war. Suffice it to say that if this is how things play out, it won't be great news for Nvidia and its profit margins.
Expect the seesawing to continue.

2022-05-19 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Bounced Back Thursday,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-bounced-back-thursday,"What happened
After sliding along with the rest of the stock market Wednesday, shares of seesawing semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are bouncing back on Thursday morning, and up 3.8% as of 11:40 a.m. ET.
Curiously, it seems you can thank two investment banks -- both of which lowered their price targets on Nvidia today -- for the rebound.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
In twin reports this morning, first Oppenheimer cut its price target on Nvidia to $300, and then banker Wedbush cut its target to $190, as TheFly.com reports today. Oppenheimer thinks Nvidia will outperform the stock market over the next year, while Wedbush is only neutral on the stock -- but if you look closely, you'll notice that both of these price targets are higher than where Nvidia stock is trading today, and suggest the shares will go up.
It's only a question of how much.
Both analysts agree, by the way, that when Nvidia reports its first-quarter earnings next week (on May 25), it's likely Nvidia will meet or even beat Wall Street's expectations. While video gaming sales may slacken, sales of server chips for data centers will pick up that slack and keep driving Nvidia's sales higher. What's of greater interest to investors, I suspect, is what happens for Nvidia after the Q1 numbers come out.
Now what
In Oppenheimer's view, Nvidia's sales will continue to grow for at least another quarter, and not slow before the third quarter -- and only then if global semiconductor supplies start coming back into balance with semiconductor demand. Wedbush thinks this could start to happen as early as the second quarter -- but again, it's a matter of degrees, and of timing. Everyone on Wall Street, it seems, is waiting to see when things go back to ""normal"" for Nvidia, and what normal will look like.
Now here's the good news: I actually think normal is going to be pretty fantastic for Nvidia. There's been a lot of finger-wagging at Nvidia for how the crypto craze has benefited its sales of fast-computing GPUs these past couple of years, and what will happen now that investors have fallen out of love with cryptocurrencies. But Nvidia was growing strongly even before the crypto phenomenon started driving the narrative. In fact, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data, Nvidia has grown its sales 31% annually over the past five years, its gross profits 34%, its operating profits 39%, and its net profits 42%.
Per year.
That's a strong, consistent growth trend, and one I don't expect to see upset by the sudden unpopularity of cryptocurrencies. If this is the new normal that Nvidia reverts to after crypto, I suspect investors are going to like this new normal just fine.

May 20 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended mixed on Friday after a volatile session that saw Tesla slump and other growth stocks also lose ground.
Worries about surging inflation and rising interest rates have pummeled the U.S. stock market this year, with danger signals from Walmart Inc WMT.N and other retailers this week adding to fears about the economy.
Wall Street opened stronger on Friday morning before turning sharply negative and adding to deep losses sustained earlier in the week.
The S&P 500 closed about 18% down from its Jan. 3 record high close. Closing down 20% from that record level would confirm it has been in a bear market since reaching that high, according to a common definition.

2022-05-23 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia Q1 Preview: Another EPS Beat in Store?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-q1-preview%3A-another-eps-beat-in-store,"Earnings season isn’t quite over just yet, although most companies have already unveiled their highly sought-after Q1 results. It’s been an interesting earnings season so far, to say the least.
Investors have taken hit after hit, with a few ultra-popular stocks such as Netflix NFLX and Amazon AMZN tanking double-digit percentages following their quarterly releases.
To put it simply, it’s been a battlefield out there, and sellers keep moving forward in the absence of buyers. Nonetheless, the market rolls on, and investors must try their best to remain focused on the long-term picture.  
On deck to report quarterly results after the bell rings on Wednesday is a company that has generated investors a multitude of gains throughout the last several years, Nvidia NVDA.
Credited with being the inventor of the highly successful Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), NVDA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies. In addition, the company resides in the Zacks Semiconductor – General Industry, an industry that currently ranks in the top 40% of all Zacks industries.
Share Performance
The five-year share performance of the company is eye-opening. Shares have returned nearly 385% over this timeframe, leaving the S&P 500 in the dust with its return of 83%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
However, price action throughout 2022 has painted a much different picture, with shares sliding nearly 45% while the S&P 500 has declined roughly 18%. It’s safe to say that this stock has significantly cooled off in 2022, but why?

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Several reasons are to blame for this, but the main driving force behind many sell-offs in high-growth tech stocks has been a hawkish Fed.
The Fed raised interest rates to cool off inflation, limiting companies’ ability to borrow funds at a cheaper rate to fuel future growth. Additionally, with debt becoming more expensive, future cash flows are negatively affected, and the market has been pricing this in.  
Growth Drivers To Watch
The company’s two primary sources of income come from its Gaming and Data Center lines of business. In fact, these two lines of business accounted for nearly 90% of all revenue in its latest Q4 report.
Gaming revenues surged 38% from the year-ago quarter and nearly 7% sequentially to $3.4 billion in the latest quarter.
A booming gaming industry induced by stay-at-home orders from COVID-19 has propelled top-line results in this line of business, and for the upcoming report, analysts forecast quarterly revenue from this segment to grow to $3.43 billion, a 26% increase from the year-ago quarter.
NVDA’s strong lineup of advanced graphics cards has made it a favorable graphics card provider among PC makers, and a significant uptick of new PC gamers and higher spending on gaming GPUs have been key catalysts.
Revenues from its Data Center surged 71% year-over-year and 11% from the prior quarter to $3.3 billion in its most recent quarterly report, driven by strong demand for its Ampere architecture products from cloud computing and AI providers. Quarterly revenue estimates for this line of business has NVDA raking in $3.6 billion, a 12% increase from the year-ago quarter.
Additionally, as cloud computing has rapidly gained popularity worldwide and data center demand has increased, NVDA has been experiencing a much higher level of demand for its GPUs – this trend is expected to continue as companies rapidly migrate to cloud computing and, in turn, further support the top line.
Below is a chart that illustrates forecasted annual EPS and revenue.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Quarterly Results & Estimates
EPS beats have been the norm for NVDA, as it has chained together 13 consecutive quarterly EPS beats dating back to October of 2018. Over its last four quarters, the company has an average EPS surprise of 7%, and in its latest quarter, NVDA beat estimates by a notable 8%.
The Consensus Estimate Trend has inched up marginally over the last 60 days, reflecting quarterly earnings of $1.30 per share – a robust 42% increase in earnings from the year-ago quarter.
NVDA regularly beats bottom-line estimates as well, with the company chaining together 12 consecutive sales beats dating back to April 2019.
For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate has NVDA pegged to rake in $8.2 billion in revenue, a substantial 43% expansion in the top line from year-ago sales of $5.7 billion.
Overall, top and bottom-line quarterly estimates heading into Wednesday reflect strong year-over-year growth rates and should give NVDA investors confidence moving forward.
Advanced Micro Devices
Seen as Nvidia’s top rival by many, Advanced Micro Devices AMD is another widely popular name in the semiconductor arena. Comparing the two companies’ recent earnings and share performances allows us to see how other semiconductor names have held up.
Year-to-date, AMD shares are down a nasty 35%, although the share performance displays that AMD shares have shown a higher blend of valuable defense.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Additionally, the company has an average EPS surprise over its last four quarters at 19%, and in its latest quarter, AMD beat estimates by a considerable 24%.
Earnings for the current fiscal year are forecasted to grow 55%, and over the next three to five years, the bottom line is forecasted to expand by nearly 33%. Similar to NVDA, AMD shares have declined dramatically, although growth rates have remained strong for both companies.
Advanced Micro Devices is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an overall VGM Score of a B.
Bottom Line
Quarterly estimates for NVDA display sizable year-over-year growth. Additionally, the company’s forward earnings multiple has retraced down to 35.4X, an absolute fraction of 2020 highs of 93.5X, marking a buying opportunity at levels not seen since pandemic lows in March 2020.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The company consistently beating on top and bottom-line estimates, increasing demand for its products, and much more reasonable valuation levels give me an optimistic outlook heading into the report. Additionally, Nvidia has an ESP Score of 2.6% heading into Wednesday.
However, the market has shrugged off many strong EPS beats, which could be the same this time. The critical thing to focus on will be top and bottom-line growth rates – not the market’s reaction. If these lines of business display continued strength, the future is bright for NVDA shares.

2022-05-24 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Micron, AMD, and Nvidia Stocks Retreated Today",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-micron-amd-and-nvidia-stocks-retreated-today,"What happened
Two months ago, computer memory maker Micron (NASDAQ: MU) reported its financial results for fiscal Q2 2022, and the news was incredible -- sales were up 25% year over year, and net profits more than tripled.
Three weeks ago, semiconductors specialist Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) reported some earnings of its own, and again the news was great -- sales up 71% and profits rising 42%.
But tomorrow, it will be Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) turn to report...and this time investors are nervous. Heading into earnings day, Nvidia stock is down 5.3% at 11:10 a.m. ET Tuesday, and investor worry is beginning to bleed over into other tech stocks. Despite the positive reports already filed, Micron stock is now down 4.6%, and AMD is losing 4.7%.

So what
What's got semiconductor investors so nervous? There are all the obvious macroeconomic issues, of course -- rising inflation (which devalues future profits), rising interest rates (which depress consumer spending -- which will have the effect of reducing future profits), a lingering supply chain crisis and the lingering Covid epidemic that caused it...and now monkeypox, too!
The big concern for Nvidia in particular, though, seems to be investors' worry that the declining value of cryptocurrencies (and I count another dozen or so cryptos down double digits today) is going to depress demand for Nvidia GPUs used in crypto mining. This fear has been reinforced by various analysts warning of the ""premium"" to MSRP charged for Nvidia's GPUs falling ""precipitously"" over the past few months. It's the reason that analysts at Susquehanna International, for example, recently warned that Nvidia may beat earnings and raise guidance when it reports tomorrow -- yet still see its stock suffer.
Now what
And yet consider: For all the pessimism about Nvidia stock, analysts still expect this company to report tremendous 43% sales growth tomorrow and 42% growth in profits. They're still expecting sales to come in nearly 30% ahead of 2021 levels by the end of this year -- and yes, that's slow-er growth, but it's not slow growth at all.
Indeed, over the last five years, Nvidia has grown its sales an average of 31% per year and its profits an average of 42% per year -- largely in years where ""crypto"" amounted to little more than a rounding error on its results. AMD's paced Nvidia on sales growth, averaging 32.5% over the last five years, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, and even Micron's growth rate -- 16% -- is nothing to sneeze at.
Long story short, all three of these growth stocks look to be doing just fine to me, and if a bit of a worry about slower growth in the short-term future results in lower stock prices today, I'd view that as less of a cause for alarm and more of a buying opportunity.

NEW YORK, May 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed higher Wednesday, boosted after minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy meeting showed policymakers unanimously felt the U.S. economy was very strong as they grappled with reining in inflation without triggering a recession.
The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's May meeting, which culminated in a 50-basis-point hike in the Fed funds target rate - the biggest jump in 22 years - showed most of the committee's members judged that further such rate hikes would ""likely be appropriate"" at its upcoming June and July meetings.
""The uniformity of opinion is a good thing,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky. ""There's a lack of uncertainty of what needs to be done in the near-term.""
""By the time (the Fed) gets to September, they will have plenty of economic data to make their move from there, so they continue to maintain optionality,"" Mayfield added.
All three major U.S. stock indexes gyrated earlier in the day amid increasing jitters stemming from business and consumer surveys, economic data and corporate earnings reports suggesting a cooling American economy - even as the Fed prepares to toss a bucket of cold water on it to tackle decades-high inflation.
Fears that overly aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed could tip the economy into recession despite evidence that inflation peaked in March has fueled those concerns.
""There’s some credence to the idea that inflation is doing (the Fed’s) job for them,"" Mayfield said. ""There’s already a cooling occurring, and financial conditions have tightened over the last month because of dollar strength and equity market weakness.""
On Thursday, the Commerce Department is due to release its second take on first-quarter GDP, which analysts expect to slow a slightly shallower contraction than the 1.4% quarterly annualized drop originally reported.
The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report will follow on Friday, which will provide further clues regarding consumer spending and whether inflation peaked in March, as other indicators have suggested.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 191.66 points, or 0.6%, to 32,120.28, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 37.25 points, or 0.95%, to 3,978.73 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 170.29 points, or 1.51%, to 11,434.74.
Nine of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 rose, with consumer discretionary stocks .SPLRCD leading the pack with a gain of 2.8%.
Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Tesla Inc TSLA.O provided the strongest lift to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, rising 2.6% and 4.9%, respectively.
Department store operator Nordstrom Inc JWN.N surged 14.0% on the heels of its upbeat annual profit and revenue forecasts.
Fast-food chain Wendy's Co WEN.O jumped 9.8% after a regulatory filing revealed that shareholder Nelson Peltz was considering a potential takeover bid for the company.
Shares of Nvidia Corp NVDA.O fell more than 8% in after-hours trading after the company's second quarter revenue forecast missed expectations.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.56-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.22-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The graphics chipmaker offered a weak sales guidance for the ongoing quarter.

The dismal guidance has pushed Nvidia shares down as much as 10% in after market trading on elevated volume. This has put ETFs having the largest allocation to NVIDIA in focus. These include MicroSectors FANG+ ETN FNGS, Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF LRNZ and Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF METV.
Nvidia Earnings in Focus
Earnings per share came in at $1.36, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 and improving 49% from the year-ago earnings. Revenues jumped 46% year over year to a record $8.29 billion and outpaced the consensus mark of $8.12 billion. Nvidia has enjoyed a strong period of revenue growth during the pandemic as videogame consumption has increased and more individuals and businesses have started using digital services that run on data centers.

Gaming revenues climbed 31% year over year to a record $3.62 billion, while data center sales surged 83% to $3.75 billion. Professional visualization revenues spiked 67% to $622 million (read: Time for Semiconductor ETFs?).

Nvidia provided revenue guidance of $8.10 billion (+/-2%) for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. This is well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.39 billion. The company forecast that sales for video game chips would decline in the current quarter, citing supply-chain disruptions in China, reduced business in Russia and slowing the gaming market.

However, the company has geared up for the largest wave of new products in its history, with new GPU, CPU, DPU and robotics processors ramping in the second half.

2022-05-27 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Nvidia Stock or Every Nasdaq Stock?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-nvidia-stock-or-every-nasdaq-stock,"It's been a tough past few months for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and its investors. Despite being swept higher in Thursday's broad bullishness, shares of the technology giant are still down by nearly half of their peak price hit in November. And the company just warned shareholders that revenue for the quarter now underway wouldn't be as healthy as analysts were initially anticipating.
Veteran investors know, however, that some of the market's biggest rewards come from buying shares of great companies while they're beaten down. Nvidia is a great company. It's just going through a rough patch.
Before stepping into a stake in this great company, though, take a step back and consider an alternative that may be a more appropriate pick for your particular portfolio.
Storm warning
If you're reading this, then you likely already know Nvidia's only anticipating a top line of $8.1 billion for the current quarter, versus analysts' expectations of $8.4 billion. CFO Colette Kress explained during the first-quarter conference call that the company's starting to see ""softness in parts of Europe related to the war in the Ukraine and parts of China due to the COVID lockdowns."" She added that ""the extent in which cryptocurrency mining contributed to Gaming demand is difficult for us to quantify with any reasonable degree of precision,"" leaving investors further guessing as to what lies ahead.
Of course, none of this is exactly new stuff for investors to digest. Even with Thursday's 6% gain, Nvidia shares are still only worth about half of what they were worth as of November, as these concerns have been priced into the stock's value for weeks now.
The headwind created by the crisis in Ukraine, continued COVID-19 lockdowns, and the implosion of cryptocurrency prices, however, are all temporary problems, even if other investors don't see it. That seemingly translates into opportunity. Like Baron Rothschild reportedly put it, ""Buy when there's blood in the streets.""
As is always the case, though, there's more to the story.
Not even the pros do it very well, or for very long
In this case the ""more"" is a question about the rest of your holdings. Namely, is your portfolio already well-founded by a diversified index fund offering you all of the stock market's upside, but also curbing the volatility that individual stocks bring to the table? It should be. Better yet, index funds also steer investors clear of the temptation to time individual entries and exits of stocks, since they're simply a means of plugging into the market's broad, long-term bullishness even if they do suffer the occasional stumble.
Statistics certainly support the idea that chasing hot stocks can do more harm than good. Take Standard & Poor's look at the performance of equity mutual funds versus the market as an example. Last year, 85% of mutual funds available in the United States failed to keep pace with the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). It wasn't just a bout of bad luck, either. Over the course of the past five years, nearly three-fourths of these funds trailed the S&P 500. For the past 10 years, the failure figure ratchets back up to 83%.
Image source: Getty Images.
And if you think one year's winners tend be perpetual winners, think again. Only a little over half of 2019's top-performing funds were even in the top quartile in 2020. Then, in 2021, only 2.2% of 2019's market-beating funds were still among the best performers.
These fund managers are professionals, usually paid with the expectation that they'll be able to beat the market. Even with all the tools and resources at their disposal, most can't. It's even tougher for investors with other responsibilities and fewer resources to beat the market by frequently buying and selling individual stocks.
A better bet
So if not Nvidia, then what?
To be clear, if you want to step into Nvidia shares while they're down, feel free. That's especially the case if you've already got a well-diversified portfolio, and if you fully understand the unique risks of buying this particular name. Chief among these risks is not knowing exactly how long its business will be disrupted by what's happening in Ukraine and more pandemic-prompted lockdowns.
If you're just starting out, though -- or if your portfolio isn't all that well diversified -- a fund built to reflect the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) or an exchange-traded fund like the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) could be an easy way to own a basket of stocks that still has most of the potential upside of Nvidia itself.
It's not the original intent, but the Nasdaq exchange has attracted more than its fair share of aggressive, successful technology companies. In addition to Nvidia, some of its top constituents include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon. None of these names are in the computer processor business Nvidia is in... a business that's still growing, and a business that Nvidia is leading. That's not necessarily a bad thing, however. Most of these companies' fortunes are tethered to the others as well as the rest of the Nasdaq's key names, and each enjoys similar growth prospects.
Perhaps most important, though, owning this basket of stocks means you don't have to constantly worry whether one of them is suddenly going to fall out of favor and do serious damage to your portfolio's value.
What's your real motivation?
It's not as sexy a choice as taking a swing on Nvidia. And it's certainly not as scintillating as the idea of being able to say you bought stock right at the bottom of its 50% drubbing.
You don't invest for ego or entertainment, though. You invest to make money by maximizing your gains while minimizing your risk. An index always does that job better than an individual stock does, especially if your portfolio is chock-full of stocks that are all too aggressive, and too closely related.

A sharp selloff has wiped billions of dollars off of valuations in the past few weeks. Growth stocks have been unfairly targeted. Many of these companies offer excellent operating models and great growth potential.
Many people believe that the market has grown overly conservative and the only way to make money is to invest in value stocks. This belief has caused many growth stocks to take a hit even though they are doing well.
The 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy for June 2022
Here are seven growth stocks that make for a great addition to any portfolio:
Ticker Company Price
INTC Intel Corporation $43.94
ORCL Oracle Corporation $72
CRM Salesforce, Inc. $159.53
NVDA Nvidia Corporation $183.66
TTD The Trade Desk, Inc. $50.64

Growth Stocks to Buy: Intel (INTC)

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was founded in 1968. It has been around for over 50 years and it has been producing computing chips since 1971. The company invented the x86 microprocessor architecture, a standard for personal computers and servers. This makes Intel one of the most important chip companies in the world.
Over the years, the company has established itself as a proven performer. However, in recent years, it has lost space to companies, like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), that have taken advantage of its complacency. But the company is looking to make a comeback with its Alder Lake chips.
Intel is also one of the few blue-chip companies offering a substantial dividend, leading to a juicy yield of 3.28%. Few tech stocks can be considered dividend stocks in the true sense of the word. Therefore, INTC stock deserves credit there.
Oracle (ORCL)

Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) provides database software, hardware, and cloud services. Its databases are used by companies worldwide in various industries, such as finance, healthcare, retail and manufacturing.
These days, you will not find Oracle on many lists of growth stocks. That has to do with the company already having a substantial base of clients to whom they cater. Users and developers are comfortable with the company’s database solutions and they are reluctant to pick a competitor. It gives the company a sticky user base, something every tech stock desires.

However, I include this on my list of growth stocks because the company has a great and growing cloud business. Although it might not be making the type of money Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services is, it provides great diversification, which the company needs.
Growth Stocks to Buy: Salesforce (CRM)

However, the most interesting aspect of the company has to be its involvement in the metaverse. The metaverse is the concept of a digital reality that is not constrained by physical laws. It is an interconnected virtual world that contains many individual facets, each with its own rules and social norms. Many companies are investing heavily in this space. Therefore, you cannot afford to miss out on this investment opportunity.

Starbucks (SBUX)
Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the most popular coffee shops in the world. In 1971, Jerry Baldwin and Gordon Bowker worked at a coffee roasting plant in Seattle when they met Zev Siegl. The three men had a dream to open up their store where they could sell high-quality roasted coffee beans and brewed coffee that they would make themselves. They wanted to create their own company, which would serve as a gathering place for people from all walks of life where they could enjoy good conversation over a cup of good coffee.
Starbucks is one of the most prominent brands globally and has a lot of influence on people’s lives. It is not just a coffee shop, but also an American icon that has been around for more than 50 years. The company started as a humble coffee bean roaster and grew into what it is today — a multinational corporation with “more than 32,000 stores in 80 countries.”
However, Starbucks is in trouble. Investors are concerned regarding a slowdown in China, high rates of inflation and employee dissatisfaction. In response, legendary Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz has taken the helm for the third time and faces a hefty to-do list.

Growth Stocks to Buy: Avalara (AVLR)

The internet has made it possible for people to buy anything and everything at the push of a button without having to go to a physical store. E-commerce is growing at an explosive rate, which means that it will continue to grow in the coming years and decades. This is great news for businesses, as they can reach more customers with their products and services than ever before.
One of the things that often gets ignored when discussing e-commerce is taxes. Avalara (NYSE:AVLR) is a niche player in the cloud software market. Their specialty lies in providing tax compliance for e-commerce companies.
Competition is limited, giving Avalara a strong position in this rapidly growing market. Therefore, investors looking for growth stocks should add this one to their portfolio.

2022-06-01 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-too-late-to-buy-nvidia-stock-3,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) posted its first-quarter earnings report on May 25. The chipmaker's revenue rose 46% year over year to $8.29 billion, which beat analysts' expectations by $190 million. Its adjusted net income increased 49% to $3.44 billion, or $1.36 per share, which also cleared the consensus forecast by seven cents.
Nvidia's stock price advanced slightly after that big earnings beat, but it's still down about 36% for the year. Is it too late to buy Nvidia as a turnaround play in this turbulent market?
Why the market turned against Nvidia
Nvidia stock closed at an all-time high of $333.76 last November, which gave the chipmaker a market cap of $834 billion. At the time, many investors thought it would become a trillion-dollar chipmaker.
Image source: Getty Images.
Nvidia's growth rates supported that bullish thesis. Its revenue rose 61% to $26.9 billion in fiscal 2022, which ended this January, and its adjusted EPS surged 78%. However, most of that growth was driven by its sales of higher-end GPUs for gaming PCs and data centers.
Both markets benefited from stay-at-home tailwinds throughout the pandemic, as more people upgraded their PCs and accessed cloud-based services. Cryptocurrency miners also purchased Nvidia's GPUs to mine Ethereum, Dogecoin, and other coins.
But as the lockdown measures were relaxed, sales of PCs cooled off as more people physically returned to work and school. Its $40 billion bid to buy Arm Holdings, which would have diversified its portfolio with a higher-margin licensing business, also fell through earlier this year.
Meanwhile, rising interest rates sparked a retreat from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, and the market's interest in Nvidia's mining chips waned.
That bearish sentiment also triggered a broad sell-off in higher-growth tech stocks like Nvidia and its rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). All those headwinds reduced Nvidia's market cap to about $470 billion today.
Was the slowdown that bad?
During the first quarter, Nvidia generated 44% of its revenue from gaming chips and 45% of its revenue from data center chips. The rest mainly came from its professional visualization, automotive, and OEM chips.
Over the past year, its sales of gaming GPUs (which are also used to mine cryptocurrencies) decelerated significantly as PC sales slowed down. However, its data center business, which sells high-end GPUs for processing machine learning and AI tasks, continued to grow like a weed.

But for the second quarter, Nvidia expects its revenue to increase about 24% year over year (but fall 2% sequentially) to $8.1 billion.
Excluding an estimated $500 million impact from the Russo-Ukrainian war and the recent COVID-19-related lockdowns in China (consisting of $400 million in gaming sales and $100 million in data center sales) in the second quarter, its revenue would still only rise 32% year over year and 4% sequentially.
Nvidia expects its gaming GPU sales to decline sequentially in the second quarter, which would represent the segment's first sequential decline since the first quarter of fiscal 2021. During the conference call, CFO Colette Kress predicted that decline would offset its ""strong sequential growth"" in the data center and automotive markets. Analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to rise 26% this year, and grow 17% in fiscal 2024.
Stable margins and shareholder returns
Nvidia's revenue growth is decelerating, but its gross and operating margins continue to expand on a non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) basis.

During the conference call, Colette Kress said Nvidia had been ""able to offset rising costs and supply chain pressures,"" and that its gross margins should expand over the long term as ""new products ramp and software becomes a larger percent of revenue."" Kress also said the company was ""closely managing"" its ""operating expenses to balance the current macro environment with our growth opportunities.""
Nvidia expects its non-GAAP gross margin to come in at a midpoint of 67.1% in the second quarter, even as it grapples with the slower growth of its gaming business and the macro headwinds in Russia and China. Analysts still expect its adjusted EPS to grow 23% this year and 19% in fiscal 2024.
As Nvidia's hypergrowth period ends, it's pouring more of its cash into buybacks. It spent $2 billion on buybacks in the first quarter and increased its current buyback authorization to $15 billion through December 2023.
But is Nvidia's stock still worth buying?
Nvidia still trades at about 30 times forward earnings and 14 times this year's sales. AMD, which faces many of the same challenges, trades at 23 times forward earnings and six times this year's sales.
Therefore, Nvidia isn't a screaming bargain yet. It's still not too late to buy Nvidia as a long-term investment, but investors should expect it to generate tepid gains this year before its next growth cycle kicks off.

Chris Hill: We've got the latest from two of the biggest companies in America, as well as a closer look at the metaverse. Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Chris Hill, and back by popular demand is Motley Fool Senior Analyst Bill Mann. Thank you for being here.
Bill Mann: A vote of one to not nothing, which is a landslide.
Chris Hill: Long time listeners know that every once in a great while, I will have someone lined up for the show, and then something happens. Life intervenes. It's not important who it was, but in this case, the person who was lined up for today's show, their laptop melted down, so they're dealing with bigger issues, and so coming in out of the bullpen, my good friend Bill Mann. I do appreciate you being here. I want to start with Nvidia because this is another interesting day. We focus on the long term. It doesn't mean that, in the very short-term, stock movements can't be interesting to ruminate on. For those who missed it, the graphics chip-maker had good result in the first quarter. They said they're going to slow down their hiring, focus more on controlling costs, and after hours yesterday, the stock was down 10 percent. You and I are talking in the middle of the trading day on Thursday, and shares are up four percent. Do you think somewhere in between late yesterday and right now, enough people on Wall Street realized, ""Oh, wait, this is a really good business with a really good leader."" [laughs] What do you make of this?
Bill Mann: What are we doing? I love the way that you've introed that because I think that when it dropped 10 percent, I think it was a snap judgment based on the fact, at least partially, that Nvidia said that their guidance was going to be lower for the remainder of the year. They're guiding down about $500 billion. Almost all of that is in the form of loss of revenues to China and Russia, that's what they've said. So it should not have been a surprise, but I think you really saw a form of ready, fire, aim. It was a very good quarter for Nvidia. You're right that we don't tend to talk about short-term movements. Looking at Nvidia right now, it's a $446 billion company. It has been as high as $700 billion this year and as low as 400. So you're talking about a $300 billion swing in what the market perceives the value of Nvidia to be. Now, I don't know about you, but I consider a 300 billion to be quite a lot of money.
Chris Hill: As do I.
Bill Mann: Good. I don't want to make assumptions about your tax brackets or anything, Hill, but to me, $300 billion is a lot of money. It just goes to show why you should not take short-term movements seriously at all. It means that the market has literally no idea how to value Nvidia, except to say that this company is worth a lot of money, and it's done a lot of great things and still great things are expected of it.
Chris Hill: This is something we're going to continue talking about in a few minutes, but Nvidia now joins the list of large significantly profitable companies that are, to one degree or another, making moves to control their costs.
Bill Mann: Yeah.
Chris Hill: Whether it's Nvidia, Facebook, Apple, which we'll hit too shortly, have you seen enough from some of the largest companies in America to give you an indication of what the economy is going to be like for the rest of this year?
Bill Mann: I think that we are likely to go very quickly from the Great Resignation to the great layoff. It seems like that is coming down the pike. If you've got companies that have as much cash on their balance sheets, as Meta and Nvidia, saying we're going to control costs, then that is obviously a place that they're going to be looking at. That is, of course, I think a concern for the economy. You never want to see an environment in which people are laid off. In the case of Nvidia, I think probably most of their cost sensitivity is going to come in their gaming segment. This is the first quarter. I think Ever, as a publicly traded company, guaranteed one of our dozens of listeners, correct me if that is wrong, I think Ever, that gaming, was not the biggest segment of revenues for Nvidia. People are actually guiding that revenues from gaming will continue to be weak through the year, and I think that that's specifically where they will be looking to tighten up their reins a little bit.
Chris Hill: Let's move on to Apple then because Apple is planning to produce the same number of iPhones this year as it did last year, roughly 220 million. Similar to Nvidia controlling costs, this is part of how Apple's being viewed right now is they're being conservative, which I think makes a lot of sense. I'm wondering if you think they are being overly conservative, given how much money this company has.
Bill Mann: I'm not sure. Chris, I've done some math to prepare for this show. I figured out that 220 iPhone units, 220 million equals one unit for every 35 people on the planet. So whenever I think about these massive tech companies, I begin to wonder in the back of my mind if there isn't an efficient horizon for them, if there isn't a place at which they can grow no more because we are just not producing people fast enough. Now they're ordering less than was being presumed. But 220 million units of the iPhone for Apple alone for one year, that is a massive number, and it is still an incredibly profitable device for them. They mint cash off of the iPhone, both in the sales of the device, and in the sales of all of the ancillaries that go with having apps that they get paid for, and everything that they get paid for due to that ecology. But it has always been in the back of my mind that, at some point, the level of growth for the units themselves has to slow down just by virtue of the fact that we're just not creating people fast enough.
Chris Hill: Where do you think this is likely to go? This is, unfortunately for you, a little bit of a crystal ball question.
Bill Mann: [laughs] Hold on, let me shake mine. [laughs]
Chris Hill: But I do wonder, with all of these huge profitable companies making these announcements, one of the questions that always goes through my mind is, so what's going to be the move after this? I'm not really a chess player, but I know enough about the game to know you got to think a few moves ahead. I'm wondering where you think Apple is going next.
Bill Mann: It is important. Even though the iPhone absolutely dominates the cultural zeitgeist when we think about these devices, they are actually in a competitive market. So for Apple to actually hit 220 devices, by the way, this isn't a guide, this is the amount that they have asked their assembly partners to make. They're not guiding to this number. They're producing this number. For Apple to hit the same number that it had last year, and I think it's pretty safe to say that the amount of spending and the willingness for people to spend has switched from 2021 to 2022.
I would be much more concerned for their competitors, the Android manufacturers, most of whom are in China, which have already said that they are having a rough quarter. So I think whenever you see big companies like this that have a huge amount of cash, this is the type of environment in which they get to, in a way, extend their lead, and to throw their weight around a little bit, and to make things very uncomfortable for their competitors. That's what I think that we're going to see from Apple. The market has not overreacted to this story. Apple is actually up today. It's down from its high by about 25 percent, which is $600 billion, if I do the math right, which is again a lot. But at the same time, I think when you see a change like this in the environment, it actually favors the more powerful, the more well-capitalized of the competitors.
Chris Hill: I'm glad you mentioned the stock price because I was legitimately surprised. Again, Apple's shares were up two percent. That's not a huge number. I'm surprised it's up at all because this has been the type of market environment, particularly over the last few weeks where any type of slowdown is punished. Is the slight rise we're seeing because the stock has come down from its highs, or is it because this provides a level of certainty for Wall Street in terms of the most profitable device, the most important device for Apple?
Bill Mann: I think it's very much the latter. Again, in this environment for Apple to be saying, ""Look, we're going to be producing the same exact amount that we did last year,"" a huge number of devices when we know just how much pressure and just how much their rivals are struggling, suggests that Apple is not about to give up its lead anytime soon in terms of being the most important manufacturer of smartphone devices. Ultimately, to me, I think that's why the market has looked at this, and said, ""Well, duh. We aren't making people quickly enough too that Apple's going to continue to grow smartphone manufacturing at a 10 percent clip. That's not how things work."" But at the same time, I don't look at this as being anything other than Apple having the capacity to extend its lead. Either way, wouldn't you love to have some Wall Street analysts just come out and say, ""Well, duh."" [laughs] Here's my question. Well, duh. Great quarter, guys. [laughs]
Chris Hill: If they follow that up, that's the one-two-punch I want to hear on the next conference call. Great quarter, guys.
Well, duh. [laughs] We need a camera of Tim Cook reacting to that.
Bill Mann: That's right. [laughs]
Chris Hill: I want to see his reaction. Bill Mann, great talking to you. Thanks so much for helping out today.
Bill Mann: Take care, Chris. Thanks.
Chris Hill: Nvidia and Apple are just two of the companies investing in the Metaverse . At this point, we don't know what the Metaverse is going to be, but that's not stopping some investors from rushing in. What are the real possibilities that may emerge? With more, here is Ricky Mulvey.
Ricky Mulvey: The promises of the Metaverse, Web3, and the Virtual Revolution are big. One thing I'm finding challenging is trying to separate the signal from the noise. Joining me now is Asit Sharma, Senior Analyst and a contributing learner to The Motley Fool. Asit, I'm so happy to see you today.
Asit Sharma: Ricky thank you for having me. Looking forward to discussing some signal, hopefully, a little bit noise. [laughs]
Ricky Mulvey: A little bit. In a way this is just noise, but that's just a podcast joke. I had a conversation a few days ago with Mac Greer. He's a longtime producer at the Fool, and he said that one of the concerns he had about the Metaverse and investing there is that he see some parallels to the 3D printing phase from a few years ago. There is that promise you could print a ballpoint pen in your living room, everything machines would play a major role in our investment strategy. Are you seeing parallels there? Is that analogy broken? What's your take?
Asit Sharma: It's a spot-on analogy. Every few years we have a big theme that washes over the popular imagination. We have no end of investors, including myself, and probably yourself too, and probably people who are listening and trying to figure out, how do I benefit from this trend if this is going to have such an impact on society and the way we work, the way we play all that good stuff? The problem is that big themes rarely live up to their promise overnight, and the effect can be very prevalent. Oftentimes it takes decades and the investable effects dissipate before we can grab onto them.
Ricky Mulvey: To that point, I saw it was virtual real estate sales, so it's just plots of land, apartments in the metaverse that reached $500 million last year, which for context, that's about how much money the WD-40 company made. When I think about the Metaverse, and especially investing in it, the thing that concerns me is I see just a mad dash. I wonder if it's better to just be patient right now.
Asit Sharma: Patience is always a virtue in investing because our brains are so wired to think about today, this week, next week, next month. But investment results, they really play out over years. I think this example is so much fun, Ricky, because it shows us that human nature doesn't change. Technology changes and opportunities change. We had the Gold Rush in California, which is the analog version of this in the 19th century, where everyone was rushing to get in and buy land in California, so you could mine for gold, and the price of shovels went up. Millions of dollars, in those days, dollars poured into the state of California, and they're reaping some of the effect today. It wasn't an overnight success for tons of people. Most people lost money in that Gold Rush. The gold rushes keep coming. It's just where they take place. Now they're more virtual [laughs] than they are physical.
Ricky Mulvey: Sometimes, to use the Gold Rush example, it's the people who make jeans who end-up making money.
Asit Sharma: For sure.
Ricky Mulvey: One thing I have been thinking though is I want to look at these tech companies, but I have a difficult time because they're so complex. How are you thinking about investing in these compounders with a high-growth potential? For me, honestly, it's a company I own, and I should have done a lot more research when I invested in it, which is Unity Software.
Asit Sharma: When we were talking about this segment, Ricky, when you and I were throwing ideas out each other, you're describing Unity as a company with high-growth potential but a complex business model. I think this shows your sophistication as investor. If you've sunk a lot of money into Unity, maybe it shows your evolving sophistication [laughs] as an investor. I mean, I think Unity is a very interesting company with a lot of potential. But I will say this, for investors who look at complexity as a roadblock to investing, just as you might a real-world obstacle that a company has to face, you are, like, ""I don't want to invest in company A because they have this merger coming up. I want to see how it does afterwards, so I'm not going to go all-in on this proposition today. I'll wait till that merger completes.""
Complexity can be the same type of hurdle. In my experience, the more complex the business model, the more likely you are going to get one of two outcomes. A, the model ends up succumbing to the complexity, so the investment returns just aren't there, or B, in practical terms, that complexity gets converted into a long-term competitive edge. My favorite example is IBM, of course. I thought this was the 1950s, but I went back and looked before the show. In the early 1960s, IBM introduced the mainframe computer, which is, that decade's version of something like a Unity software, which has an incredibly broad platform to help game designers, to help digital artists monetize their creative output. That was a fine time to invest in IBM, but it was hard to see it in April of 1964. To me, it's almost that you invest with a starting small position in these types of high complexity, high-potential models, and it's an inverse to the complexity relationship as they become less complex, and you see the business results start to emerge, you can put more money in.
Ricky Mulvey: Generally, I believe in the continued digital transformation. Are you looking at the picks and shovels, the end-products, both, how are you thinking about it as an investor?
Asit Sharma: I think this goes back to what Mac was pointing out about the 3D printing space. It's hard to invest in the end-products just now wherever digital transformation is concerned, unless you're talking about companies that are providing the structure for digital transformation. You're looking at project collaboration software or automating business processes. Those look actually more like picks and shovels. I'm a believer in early in a big theme, invest in the picks and shovels because you can see those outcomes. They're a lot more visible versus going all-in in companies that I like, like Unity, like Roblox software, enabling those positions because it's rare for both that pure-play idea and a profitable business model to merge up at the beginning of the game, it takes time for both of those to synthesize and for everyone to be able to say, ""This is an awesome investment. I'm going to invest in Amazon.com."" It's 2003. I didn't get in the IPO a few years ago, but now it's the time, you can still make a lot of money being patient.
Ricky Mulvey: You had a great conversation with Matthew Ball on the podcast feed. You asked Matthew Ball what his dream was for the Metaverse, and he talked about the de-centralization. But I think it's very easy to get caught up in the technicalities of it. I think that, in the end, there are a lot of very cool things that are going to come from this digital transformation from the Metaverse. What's one dream that you have that you'd like to be able to be a part of?
Asit Sharma: I'm going to give mine and then I'm eager to hear yours as well. I have this dream that a really great novelist should be able to work with digital designers to show us what they visualize when they're writing their works. Now, when you read a novel that's a really special experience. It's an act of iterative creation. It's someone else's consciousness that's being introduced to your consciousness, and the story you weave, the visuals that you come up with, the move that you interpret out that novel is actually more important, I think, than just the writer's conception. You're merging two different consciousness together.
We get a taste of this right now when great writers work with movie studios, I'm thinking of the Harry Potter franchise, so you get some sense of what writers were thinking about. I don't want to replace the experience of reading a novel and having your mind's eye create the story. But it'd be such a fun adjunct to be able to see something as an author visualized, and we've got a great analog version of this. I think it's unique, maybe the only one that exists in the world. But the Nobel Prize winning novelist Orhan Pamuk has curated a museum in Istanbul. It's called The Museum of Innocence, that has objects he visualized from the time that novel is taking place. You can go toward that museum now and see objects as he saw them as he was writing this novel. To replicate something like this in a Metaverse experience, I think, will be a lot of fun. What's the investable takeout of that? It could go back to Unity Software or audit tests. The companies that are creating the kinds of tools that will make such an experience happen.
Ricky Mulvey: It's the way that great artists could merge consciousness between writer and reader, and in this case, it can also be a symbolic and virtual environment. For me. I guess, one dream I have, it's a little bit more simple. I am really excited for live sports. I think that's where you see a winner of something like Disney. I have family in Ohio, I have family in Australia and I think this is a way where you could imagine sitting at a Cincinnati Red's game or an NBA basketball game and spending time together is one thing that I'm particularly excited about. Moving on, I guess one question we've been talking about the metaverse a lot, digital transformation. What's one digital transformation that you're excited about, that you're watching, paying attention to, that doesn't necessarily have to do with the metaverse?
Asit Sharma: I'm actually piggybacking off of something that you wanted to talk about when we exchanged our notes. But that's OK because I think it's so fascinating. For me I'm interested in a company called DeepMind Technologies, which is a subsidiary of Alphabet, the parent company of Google. DeepMind develops neural networks. As these smart networks have a differentiation from what we normally think of as like machine-learning. Machine-learning is the model becomes smarter by watching data as it comes in, making its own assumptions. Neural networks at their best, they iterate by themselves.
They learn by themselves. I love to talk about two examples, DeepMind is responsible for AlphaGo, a Go playing computer program, and Alpha 0, which is a chess playing program. Alpha 0 was trained by just being introduced with a set of rules. It then played 44 million games against itself in nine hours and came out of that as a bad, blank [laughs] I experienced, challenged the best brute-force computing program of the time. One with some really fascinating examples of how to come at chess in ways we haven't thought of before. This really excites me, it's the potential for artificial intelligence to come up with insights into creativity that we just haven't considered. There's not a lot to monetize there. But you asked outside of the investable universe, what's attracting my attention.
Ricky Mulvey: I think there will be investable things, especially for companies like Alphabet, Gmail, NeuroMetrix work for example, which is every email ever written on Gmail is now being used to predict what you will write next, which is incredible and just because you know that's incredibly valuable, I don't know how to value that as an investor.
Asit Sharma: Ricky, there's a very interesting long-form article, I read. I still get the Sunday print edition of the New York Times, and in The New York Times Magazine insert a couple of months ago, there was an article called AI is Mastering Language. Should we trust what it says? I think you'd enjoy that, Ricky, or maybe it'll just scare you a little more.
Ricky Mulvey: I will check it out. Anyway, Asit, great chatting with you, and good to see you.
Asit Sharma: That's a lot of fun, thanks so much, Ricky.

2022-06-06 00:00:00+00:00,What Can Investors Learn from Nvidia’s Risk Factors?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-can-investors-learn-from-nvidias-risk-factors,"Santa Clara, CA-based technology giant Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) has made significant strides in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Besides solidifying its footprint in the designing of graphics processing units (GPUs) and application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science, the company has emerged as a major player in the burgeoning semiconductor manufacturing industry.
Recently, the company reported impressive first-quarter results. In the quarter, its earnings stood at $1.36 per share, up 49% year-over-year, and revenues climbed 46% from the year-ago quarter to $8.29 billion.
According to TipRanks, shares of Nvidia have declined more than 37% year-to-date and 12.3% in the last three months. Taking this into account, let’s discuss some of Nvidia's major risk factors.
Risk Factors 
As per the TipRanks Risk Factors tool, Nvidia’s top risk categories are Finance and Corporate and Tech and Innovation, which contribute five risks each to the total 24 risks identified for the stock.
Under the Finance and Corporate risk category, Nvidia informs its stakeholders that risks arising from share price and shareholder rights are the major headwinds for the company.
The company highlights that the activities of various shareholder advocacy groups, certain institutional investors and investment funds are focused on the company’s ESG practices. Further, the company opines that any deviation from the company’s stated ESG standards can materially impact its business operations.
Meanwhile, the company’s primary risk within the Tech and Innovation category remains Innovation/ R&D.
Nvidia underlines that it operates in a dynamic industry and any slacking in terms of innovation, design or new products may hurt its revenue and financial condition. Further, the company says, any massive disruption or technological advancement for which it did not prepare adequately can impact its business.
Stock Rating
Recently, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $250, which implies upside potential of 33.6% from current levels.
Overall, the Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on the stock based on 27 Buys and five Hold. NVDA's average price target of $271.41 implies upside potential of 45% from current levels. Shares have gained 6.3% over the past year.
Conclusion

David Gardner: Thanks to longtime listener and fellow Fool Jason Moore. I spent 28 minutes this week relistening to my podcast from November 25th, 2015. It was a mailbag reflecting on the month that was that had been November 2015. Do you remember that month? No? Well, the reason that I do is that Jason pointed out it was my very first mailbag, my very first time programming for this podcast. Not what I wanted to do; not what was on my mind, but what was on yours. That you shared through emails or tweets with me doing my best to respond. Well, I closed that podcast almost seven years ago wondering whether we'd ever do it again? Saying it's pretty much all up to you. If you liked it, well you did let me know in those following weeks that it was worthy. So we ended that next month, December 2015, with a mailbag, and in fact, every month since including May 2022 only on this week's Rule Breaker Investing.
Welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing. Looking back on the month that was, it was a shorter month for podcasts; for this podcast anyway, just three weeks proceeded. This week's podcast we kicked off this month with a reviewapalooza looking back at stocks picked in April's past, April 2021, 2020, 2019. Ouch, is a good way to summarize that particular podcast. A week after that, it was what you have learned from me, Volume 3. It was my birthday week and lots of great notes and an opportunity for me to summarize some of the key learnings and key takeaways from longtime listeners in order that new listeners might get up to speed. Then last week it was the 14th in my long-running series, Great Quotes.
It was Great Quotes Volume 14, a smorgasbord of quotes, but that's typically how they are; five quotes at a time. I want to kick off this mailbag with some Twitter hot takes reacting to some of those. @Craig's Brain, that's Craig Hawkins on Twitter. Craig, you wrote, ""Rational optimism is the Motley Fool trade I admire most. I wanted to incorporate that into my life even more than I want good investing advice though, it's great to get both."" Well, thank you for that Craig. Rational optimism doesn't just come naturally for me, but for many others, I think it's contagious. I learned a lot about it from the book, The Rational Optimist by Matt Ridley. So Craig and others listening, if you haven't read that book, it's a wonderful take, looking truly at the long game of history typically illustrating, at least in recorded history, how often from one generation to the next, humans thought were getting worse.
Were going to be worse. Therefore, how ironic it is, looking backwards, at seeing truly how many things have gotten so much better over the course of recorded history. So The Rational Optimist by Matt Ridley is just a wonderful book. Thanks for the tweet, Craig. Next one up, @RyanCPacker. Ryan, you were reacting to one of my great quotes from last week, ""Celebrate the sub-optimal because therein lies your growth."" You wrote, ""Love this. Find joy in the journey. Make every day a spirit of gratitude and you'll be amazed at how far you can come. Growth indeed comes from pushing through the storms of life. What matters is what we do in those storms. The future is as bright as our faith."" Ryan Packer, thank you for that, @RyanCPacker, we want more from you, sir, on this podcast. Last one I want to feature @Triggs1Martin, Martin Triggs.
Martin you wrote, ""Always refreshing and inspiring to hear another volume of Great Quotes."" Makes one think and reflect, especially today's last quote which I will share again, in a sec. ""We should try to succeed at something that does matter, finding our role in the great metadrama. That quote again from DL Moody, love it here it is once again, ""Our greatest fear should not be a failure, but of succeeding at something that doesn't really matter."" So yes, Martin, I agree we should try to succeed at something that does matter and that theme will run through a few of the notes on this month's mailbag. So again, thank you for lots of great tweets, especially the birthday wishes, always appreciate it. Without further ado, let's get started with item number,1 from the May 2022 Rule Breaker Investing mailbag. This note comes from Emmy Bullock. ""Hi David, A little background on me, I'm a 35-year-old stay-at-home mom of three young boys and recently found out I'm expecting another baby in December. I became a CPA back in 2011, and worked for a couple of years, until deciding to stay home full-time with my boys. I love finance, and I've recently learned to love investing. I found the Fool just two years ago back in 2020, and I have really gone all-in on Foolish investing, managing all my husband's retirement accounts and investing them in individual stocks. As you can guess, since I started in late 2020, my portfolio is pretty much cut in half. It's been a real challenge seeing this happen but I'm just trusting your principles of investing. You speak with so much wisdom and clarity and I just trust that as I follow the ways of the Motley Fool, everything will work out. I appreciate your humility and your positivity for the future.
""Those are two characteristics I believe great leaders have. I'm in this for the long haul and I just wanted to thank you for all you do to help people, like me, have hope for a successful and happy future in all aspects of life. I also really enjoyed the quote from your most recent podcast about doing what matters most. I feel for me I am doing what matters most right now, which is raising my children to be good, hard working, kind, resilient, and educated humans. I hope we can all live our lives doing what matters most and seeking to know what that is for ourselves. Thank you again for all your work in providing true principles to follow and investing in life and doing your podcasts every week,"" signed Emmy.
Well, I wanted to lead off with that one Emmy because, well it hurts a little bit to share a note like yours. I think it's appropriate in another month of stock market pain, which I'll be speaking to in a moment to lead off with a little bit of hurt because hurt hurts. I think it's a very human thing to feel it. It's very important to feel it and to experience it. I've never given birth to a child, I never will, but I know that hurts. The stock market drops one year in every three and that hurts. There are lots of other things that hurt in life. It particularly hurts to think that you've followed us, trusted us, believed in our principles as we do ourselves, practiced our principles with diligence and care, and you've watched everything get cut in half. That does not feel good.
That does not ever hear good to me when I hear somebody say that they followed me and that that's happened. Yet all I can say is that has happened before, and it will probably happen again in future. If you'd started investing in the year 2000, 2001 happened. If you started investing in 2007, 2008 happened. If you started investing in late 2020 or 2021, well 2022 is happening. So I acknowledge that and I congratulate you nevertheless on the resilience, the same resilience you'll be modelling for your boys and already are resilient, of course, one of I think the United States' core values. You actually worked another one in there as well, when you said you're trying to teach your boys to be kind. I think kindness is one of America's five core values as well. I love seeing that in your note. I do find myself now needing to be particularly optimistic using some numbers because I feel as if there is so much pessimism out there.
While I've taken pains many times to say the market drops one year in every three and I did it just about a minute ago, I'm going to say very emphatically, the market rises two years in every three; has done so historically. That's why this works. Even if you have a really bad year or two and I know you're playing the long game, Emmy, and you're doing it from a young age, 35, looking ahead for your family, decades. So I want to remind you and everybody listening, the market rises two years in every three and has averaged historically a return of 9-10 percent in the United States, year-in and year out. I have referred to this, I talked about this earlier in May on this podcast as a once in a decade drop. It's a once-in-a-decade wash-out. The Motley Fool has been in business about 30 years now.
That means we watched what happened in 2001, we watched what happened in 2008-09, and we're watching what's happening now in 2021, 2022. So a lot of us who got started very recently, please note this doesn't happen very often. In fact, 1440 Daily Digest, which is a little free newsletter that drops me my news each morning around 6:00 AM Eastern, I first heard about it, by the way, on this podcast when Dan Pink said it was his way of following what happens in the world without having to read all the negative headlines all the time. It's more of a straight shot, daily digest of the news. 1440 Daily Digest. So thank you again, Dan Pink. But in the Daily Digest of Monday of this week, I encountered this fact, the Dow is down for the eighth consecutive week, that was last week, its longest weekly losing streak since 1923.
While I've been using phrases like once in a decade wash-out, please know that what we're experiencing right now is historic, 1923, was just about 100 years ago. Now, eight weeks of the Dow doesn't even mean that much in the grander scheme, but it is emotionally, sometimes mentally healthy to remind ourselves of just what we're seeing right now happening is unusually negative. Not likely to happen over the next eight weeks, not likely to happen again probably for a long time. I want to conclude Rule Breaker mailbag item number 1 by saying simply Emmy, you're doing it right, stick with it.
Onto Rule Breaker mailbag item number 2, this one from Arvin Sharma, ""Dear David, thank you for everything you do. I enjoy your show. I'm a relatively new follower of you, 2+ years."" Sounds like a 2020 starting date. Once again Arvin, ""Every time I listened to you I learn something new. That means a minimum of 104 items a new weekly podcast every week for two years is 104. I know you or any listeners will not have time to listen to that long list of things. But here is one of my favorite things I've learned from you and here it is consistency. Over the past two-plus years, we experience many different conditions. The market was flying high, we were scared and stuck at home, we face political and social uncertainty, and the interest rates fell. Later this year we were hit by inflation. Rates raise, the market crash, stocks did well and then really bad. We had war and so on. Yet I can confidently say that if you listen to any of your podcasts, irrespective of what's happening during that time, your message remained consistent, your rules did not change, your beliefs remain strong. This is what I've learned from you. Thank you,"" Arvin.
Well, thank you, Arvin. I think to reflect on that briefly, I think if you're a purpose-driven person or working for a purpose driven organization, it makes it a lot easier for you to be consistent, to use your lovely word, to be resilient, to keep practicing what you're preaching. If you're purpose-driven, it's a lot easier, if you're not, if you're still trying to determine why you're doing what you're doing. I can imagine you could be all over the place and if you're up podcaster, that means you're saying many different things over many different periods.
I've tried to say the same thing for the most part as you're pointing out, from one week to the next. But I always try to find new, imaginative and fun ways or friends to say those things to you. But I think purpose-driven is really helpful here. I will also say the ideas that I tried to put out to you every week, these have been honed over time. I've earned some scars for what I share with you every week, but when I find something that works, I tend to stick with it and so these ideas have been honed over time. Of course, when you do what we do at The Motley Fool and you publish all of your numbers in all of your returns, and you do that over long periods of time, everybody knows all of your winners and all of your losers.
You make yourself accountable and I think that also helps contribute toward consistency. My last quick thought here Arvin is, I hope I'm consistently open-minded and consistently creative. I've changed my mind many times over the course of my life. I generally try to make a better decision to replace something that was worse with something that was better. I'm sure you're trying to do the same thing.I want to make it clear that part of the consistency that I hope you'll hear from Rule Breaker Investing is a consistent willingness to rethink things. Sometimes to change our minds if we come up with a better idea. As I think Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, he had a small f on that adjective, ""A foolish consistency is the hub goblin of small minds."" I could even agree with him because he's not talking about capital F, Foolish.
He's talking about a small f foolish consistency, been there, done that, going through the motions, that kind of thinking or living is not what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to lead a more interesting life with you and many others. Trying to remain open-minded as we go, which indeed has helped lead me to many Rule Breakery insight. I definitely want to accept the compliment. I take that from you. Thank you Arvin for consistency and I want to bounce it back to you and remind all of us that we should be consistent with the good things. We should look to replace the bad things, and more than anything if you're purpose-driven, you'll probably have a steadier hand on the tiller. Rule Breaker mailbag item number 3, this from Jake. Jake, thank you for this wonderful note. ""Hello David, first-time writer to you or anyone at fool.com. But I felt compelled to write to you this week to say thank you and happy birthday, as my birthday was just last week as well. My name is Jake, I'm 24 years old, an active duty military member from New Jersey and graduated college last year with a degree in mathematics. The theme of this email is growing pains."" We're going back to more hurt. But you know what? Let's do it. ""During one of my schools quarantines due to COVID outbreaks, we did classes on Zoom, human interaction limited to only our roommates,"" Jake writes, no eating in the cafeteria together, etc. This happened to be during the time of the meme stock Dogecoin craze of February 2021, some of my friends were making thousands buying options on Robinhood on GameStop, while others bought in Dogecoin at one penny. Here I was with just a simple checking and savings account, not knowing anything about investing.
""As my family has always been blue-collar. Money under mattress or savings account, don't trust credit cards, don't talk about money kind of a family. With my situation of being quarantined and nowhere else to go, I went all in on learning about finances and investing. Over the past year and change, I feel like I've been through the ringer and done it all. I almost immediately found The Motley Fool and became a subscriber, but also found how compelling friends could be when they said, 'Oh this microcap biotech stock is going to pop if the FDA approve so and so drug, etc.' I saw just how many YouTube financial 'gurus' there were and got caught up in the trading in and out of stocks while listening to Jim Cramer and my friends who made thousands on volatility with stocks like GameStop, AMC, and crypto pump-and-dumps to make money quick. When I told my mom I was learning about the stock market, her response was, 'Your father once was in the stock market, lost money and has never invested again so be careful, it's just a big gambling machine. But if you find a winning formula with that math degree of yours, can you help me?'"" Jake's mom said. ""The Foolish way with a capital F has prevailed and I believe is the winning formula. I invest in my employer's 401(k) up to their match. I put $500 into my Roth IRA each month, live below my means, save for my personal goals and invest extra cash into a brokerage account. Altogether, I've built up a portfolio,"" I love this, ""of 24 stocks matching my age, smiley, and also a couple of cryptocurrencies. Anyway, they all embody trends I believe in and hope to see prevail for the next decades.
""I don't plan on selling for the foreseeable future things like renewable energy, Brookfield Renewable,"" he names, ""Streaming, Roku,"" he names, ""Fintech, Upstart, and Block,"" he names. ""Not staying at hotels, Airbnb,"" he names. ""Data, data, data, Confluent."" he names. ""Cybersecurity, CrowdStrike,"" he names. ""Pets are family, Chewy,"" he names, and ""Online dating, Bumble,"" he names. ""And yes,"" Jake writes ""I'm now helping my own parents invest for their retirement. Oh, how the tables have turned. Do I wish I learned about investing in February 2020 and invested in these companies back then? You bet I do.
""But being a baseball player, board game lover, and listener of your podcast,"" birds of a feather flock together Jake, ""I have learned losing is a part of the learning process since beginning investing in February 2021. It feels like my portfolio has done nothing but lose, lose, and keep on losing. But I'd buy, buy, and keep on buying due to the positive influence I received from you,"" and then he calls out lots of Fool stars, ""The Brians, Bill Mann, Matt Frankel, Chris Hill, etc., through Motley Fool Money, Rule Breaker Investing, Motley Fool Live, YouTube videos. The list goes on. ""Let's say yes, the market will go up in the long run with such a long time horizon ahead of me, I'm more than happy to keep buying great companies that I don't plan on selling anytime soon. But I couldn't have acquired and maintained this mindset without the help of everyone at the Fool, especially you.
""Even though my portfolio has only ever seen red, it feels like, it"" hurts to read that, ""I look forward to being 50 and seeing a lot more green. Who knew?"" Jake concludes, ""It would take a global pandemic to learn how to invest and take care of my finances. But I'm forever grateful for experiencing these growing pains, especially times like the last couple of weeks. Thank you specifically for The Day The Market Crashed podcast and The Year The Market Skyrocketed."" You are very welcome, sir. ""Because I am able to learn, get mental reps through disciplined finances, build healthy habits, embrace curiosity, and commit to making myself smarter, happier, and richer with my daily thoughts and action for success in the future. Cheers to the winning formula of investing for the long-term. Happy birthday, David, thank you for all you've done and continue to do the next generation of investors are forever grateful. Fool on, Jake.""
Well, some of the good birthday wishes I got earlier this month I couldn't fit in to that particular week's podcast and some of them arrived later but Jake that was a great, big happy birthday gift to me and I especially appreciate that from somebody so young. I turned 56 this month you turned, wow 24 the age of my kids these days and I just wanted to say, I feel for you. By the way, this was announced this week just as GameStop is launching its wallet for cryptocurrencies and NFTs, cough, I wanted to say by contrast you are building such a strong foundation. Your foundation consists not just of your great money habits which you have learned and have been embodying now for more than a year. But I also hear a lot of wisdom from you that speaks to a lot more than investing in things like build healthy habits and embrace curiosity, etc. Let me conclude this mailbag item by saying, Jake if you were a stock sir I would be buying you, Fool on.
All right, Rule Breaker mailbag item number 4, this one from Chris from Toronto. He starts with, ""Hey Rick and David baseball. Now that I have your attention I was hoping you could help with my question about where you draw the line between a smaller cap stock and getting into stuff that might be a tinge too risky."" Chris writes, ""I understand the logic behind avoiding penny-stocks that can be easily manipulated and that the companies they represent are very cheap for a reason. Where I've never been clear is why a low-price stock might be considered risky even if its market cap is of a decent size.
""Here's a company that has caught my eye recently,"" and Chris doesn't even name the company he just gives these particulars, ""The market cap is $1.4 billion, the share price of the stock is $3.23. The volume, I assume that's the average daily volume for this stock is 3.17 million shares and the beta is 1.3."" Quick definition for those who don't know the beta, it's a measure of volatility and if you think of the stock market itself just writ large all of the stocks as 1.0 than a company with a beta of 1.3 moves 30 percent more exaggeratedly up and down than the market with its beta of 1.0. If you find yourself, still scratching your head after my brief definition feel free to Google it and learn about beta.
Well, Chris clearly has included that as one of the four stats. ""Market cap 1.4 billion, share price $3.23, volume about three million shares a day, beta 1.3. Now looking at the above numbers,"" Chris writes, ""With no other context the market cap seems investable, 1.4 billion. It's on the small side but it's not in micro-cap territory. According to everything I've read from The Motley Fool, we should avoid companies with share prices below five dollars a share."" Chris writes, ""This seems to contradict your level of market caps though.
""If this company had half as many shares traded for $6.46 a share, how would that make it less risky? I threw in the volume of the stock as well in case that affected your answer of 3.7 million shares doesn't seem like it would be easy to manipulate and at the same time with the current share price that's only about $10 million in daily transactions which is a small percentage of their worth. I'm hoping you can clarify your thoughts on how the share price of a stock impacts perceived risk. Of course, you have no clue what the company is I'm quoting and I don't expect you to make any type of recommendation based on this very narrow data set. Just looking for some insights on how to interpret the above. Thank you in advance,"" Chris from Toronto.
He concludes, go Jays. I'll say right back to you Chris, go Twins. Thank you. But let's get to the heart of the matter. Speaking of things that matter, one of the themes of May 2022, there are three things that matter when we're talking about the size of stocks and whether or not you would want to be invested in small size companies. The first thing that matters, is market cap. We've got a whole game show created around that, that we played for years now I know you know how much I love my market caps, you're right. That's the first thing that matters to me, market cap. For a company to have a $1.4 billion market cap,
I would also call that outside of micro-cap territory, sub one billion, maybe sub $500 million market caps are really micro-cap penny-stock territory and so you're right. I do think that 1.4 billion is potentially investable. I also want to mention another thing that matters, this doesn't count as one of the three this is, we'll call if market cap is 1A, I'm mentioning 1B which I've always called daily dollar volume. We can calculate it because of the numbers you submitted, you just take the share price of that company, $3.23 and you multiply it by the average daily volume and you've already done that in your email you sent us because you came up with about 10 million which is about right. The reason I look at that number is, it tells you how much money, how much liquidity is moving through the stock on a daily basis so a daily dollar volume of $10 million is nothing to sneeze at.
What I mean by that is it's not too small, it's not in real penny-stock manipulation territory. I will also say it's not that big but you already know that. We're talking about a small company here but a $10 million daily dollar volume is OK for me. On a side note, I used to have a minimum daily dollar volume in mind when I pick stocks for Rule Breakers and Stock Advisor of $50 million. You typically, especially in the last decade or so you wouldn't see me pick a stock that didn't have daily dollar volume of 50 million or more. That's because a lot of Motley Fool members would buy right after we would put out our newest pick which makes sense because you subscribe for our picks and so you're going to act on the information but I was finding, sometimes there were exaggerated moves in the stocks after I picked them.
In fact it seemed to become almost a monthly thing which is part of the reason I got frustrated a little bit toward the end of my stock-picking career because it felt like a lot of short-term bandwagoning and there was no way to stop it and I'm not even blaming our members because these days computers, algorithmic trading, momentum traders, all kinds of people might be jumping in to buy stocks or sell stocks at any given moment. Anyway, there was a huge bandwagon effect that I noticed which I found frustrating and therefore having a larger daily dollar volume made more sense to me. Anyway getting back to the three things that matter, the second is what the company does and if you've been a regular Rule Breaker Investing podcast listener or a follower of mine or our services over the years you know about my snap test.
I first wrote about it in my 1998 book, Rule Breakers, Rule Makers and it's when you snap your fingers. There I went again, snap. I don't know how well that comes through my microphone here as I podcast from Wilmington, North Carolina which is where I am this week, it's beach week. I don't know how well that snap came through but I hope you understand the concept which is if you were to snap your fingers like that and the company we're talking about this company, we're talking about right now, $1.4 billion market cap.
If it disappeared overnight, would anyone notice? Would anyone care, would everyone notice? Would everyone care? In general, the thing that matters number 2 really matters to me. I want to think that if I'm investing my hard-earned money into a company and going to leave it there for years I really insist that that company be doing something important, something that matters in the world that's good, that people are noticing, call-out, and are grateful for. That's true of many companies in many different industries. That's why I've always enjoyed picking stocks across many different industries.
I love sharing Jake's note earlier, sharing some of his stocks and what a wide array of different companies in different places in the world he has in his portfolio which makes me happy. The snap test helps remind you, does what your company is doing matter, does your company matter? That's the second thing I'd be looking at that very small company. The third and final one is more about you, not about the market cap or what the company does it's how much you invest into that really matters too. I'm perfectly happy for anybody to buy a penny-stock if they really want to speculate in what I consider to be an unlikely to succeed, often silly manner. I'm still happy for you to do it, if you're putting down one-tenth of one percent of your overall portfolio. In other words, even if it went to zero you would barely notice that how much you invest really matters.
We've talked about the Sleep Number on this podcast, one of the six principles of a Rule Breaker portfolio. Know your Sleep Number. All along way of saying in so many words how much you invest really matters. I would tend not to put very much at all in highly speculative very small companies. I've done that before, it usually hasn't worked for me. If there's an inch you're looking to scratch here and you really want to speculate you have my permission to do so with not too much money from your portfolio, not too frequently. Just realize that how much we invest or where we put it matters so much. Three things that matter the market cap matters, what the company does matters and certainly how much you invest in it matters as well. Chris, go twins.
Rule Breaker mailbag item number 5, and this one comes in a brand new form. We have an innovator on the podcast this week, Jason Moore @JimminyJilickrz on Twitter, longtime Fool and avid Rule Breaker Investing fan and Jason you decide to take to Twitter this month and record a short video. I assume you turned your iPhone on yourself, record a short video as a mailbag submission which means Rick Engdahl please play the innovator's award from Rule Breaker Investing the podcast sound effect. That was just played for the first-time because Jason, you just earned it. You took the time to record a video. Now this is an audio podcast so we're just going to hear the audio. It last 63 seconds. Jason, take it away.
Jason Moore: Hey David, how are you doing? Happy Friday. [laughs] I had a quick question for you. I thought maybe you could speak to it on mailbag if you had a chance. I thought I'd ask it given all the bot talk on Twitter lately I thought I'd show my face and show a little bit of authenticity. [laughs] Anyways, with markets being what they are and so many of the rule-breakers stocks being down as they are. We're seeing a lot of talk lately about ETFs and indexing as a strategy. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are about that. At this point, is it like timing the market and it's just a fool's errand? Or when we're down low like this, is this really not the time to be putting stuff into indexing and going a little bit more heavy handed into the Rule Breaking stocks. Clearly, you don't have a crystal ball. But you've been through a lot more of this than I have and I like your thoughts on it. Have a great night.
David Gardner: Well, first of all, I love that you're calling out the bots talk because of course, the much ballyhoo pitch that Elon Musk is making for Twitter became dependent at least for a time. Maybe you still is on the questions as to how many bots that is an automated robot like accounts, our member accounts on Twitter. How many humans are on Twitter and how many non-humans are on Twitter? I won't answer that question with this mailbag, but I love that at least one human, Jason, you took the time to make a video show your face. I want to say first off that I've always been a fan of indexing and ETFs.
Going back to really our first book, The Motley Fool Investment Guide, Tom and I wrote about the power of good index funds, specifically usually Vanguard index funds. I think while Vanguard has never needed our help, I suspect we've send billions of dollars of value their way over the course of the last 25 years because we've always said this is the first step for many people in investing is to buy an index fund, usually a Vanguard fund. Why Vanguard? Because here in the US anyway, they've always been the cheapest funds. Index funds are very much a commodity. So like a lot of commodities, you just like to pay as little as you can for them. That's why we've always favorite Vanguard.
But ETFs these days very much on par in terms of really cheap fees associated with investing in ETFs. So first of all, Jason, I'm here to say, we are fans of ETFs. We're fans of people saving money and then investing it in things that go up, good things over time. Now, I know as you're a longtime listener, you know that I'm a rule breaker. Rule Breaker Investing is just one form of investing at The Motley Fool, it happens to be mine. I've never had any interest in ETFs. I don't think I've ever bought an ETF. Those who do buy ETFs usually can be divided into two groups. Most of them are passive investors who don't want to have to think about what stock to buy. They don't want to have to analyze stocks or thinking about industries or ask, what's going to be the best fast casual restaurant? What's going to be the best semiconductor chipmaker? They aren't interested in those questions.
So they buy ETFs that might give them the whole fast casual restaurant industry, like a fast casual restaurant, ETF, which just buys equal amounts of lots of different fast-casual restaurants and you as a holder of that ETF, get to own a little bit of all of them. Or of course, big ETFs like ones that own the whole market. So you just own every stock on the market, just a tiny little bit of each. So that's the first group and I think the larger group of people who own ETFs today are those who are just doing a passively over time, which I think is great. There certainly is a second group of people who very actively trade in and out of ETFs. I would say gambling in the shorter-term based on their notion of what industry, sector or country, what area of the market might be about to rise or fall. Some of them are actually hedging.
So a lot of hedge funds will hedge against risk they're taking elsewhere in their portfolio with ETFs. But this is the more active trader crowd around ETFs. Now, in your question, it wasn't clear to me which of those two you meant, but my answer is going to be the same no matter what. I like indexing in ETFs, if you're paying very little to get broad diversification in an area of the market or the whole market that you wish. I like those, they are convenient, easy way to get invested and to add to over time. But of course, as a rule breaker, finding the best companies and investing in holding in the best has, in my experience, always beaten the market over time and I think it always will. I think that's actually ironically helped by what I've often called this era of Big Dumb Money.
That's capital B, Big. Capital D, Dumb with a B, Money. Capital M. Big Dumb Money is what happens when everybody is indexing, when everybody is buying ETFs or index funds and they don't care. They're indiscriminately buying all of the fast casual restaurants when really Chipotle has been among the very best in or at least one of our few investments within that area. I've also done pretty well Texas Roadhouse over time and there's some other great companies that I've missed in that. But if everybody else doesn't really care in their ETF, which one they own, so they just don't all of them. I think you and I are rewarded as rule breakers by selecting, by being selected, by studying up and finding the best. As I've often said in the past, I try to find excellence, buy excellence, and add to excellence overtime. I sell mediocrity, that's how I invest.
Maybe give you an answer, you weren't surprised by Jason, but I hear also in your question, maybe given how bad the market has been and given how particularly bad it's been to Rule Breaker Investing, might this be a reason you would want to start indexing instead into each listener. I would say, pick your poison, know thyself and make your best calls for yourself. For me, I'm going to continue buying stocks. But on the other hand, if you feel as if you've gone a little in too deep or over your head or the pain is hurting a little bit too much, not just to Jason but do anybody listening, I'd say maybe you've learned something good about yourself that you don't have quite as much risk tolerance as you thought at the start.
That this pain we're feeling which is enduring is really not comfortable for you and if that's true of you, I would say feel free to start indexing some more if you like. Rule Breaker, mailbag, item number 6. ""Happy birthday,"" says Eric Devore. Thank you, Eric. You write, ""I've had this open email draft sitting for a week or so, but have been slammed in the studio, writing and producing several albums, working on a few TV shows, Hell's Kitchen,"" he mentioned, ""MTV's Challenge All Stars,"" he mentions. Ironically, I just had a lovely meeting two nights ago about a new video game. I think the reason Eric says that's ironic is because he knows how much I love video games. I'm not so much an MTV Challenge viewer and I probably don't listen to as many albums as many others listened to, but I sure do like even with the age of 56, great video games. So congratulations on what's happening for you right now, Eric, you go on, ""But I did have a chance to listen to your most recent RBI podcast since I've finally taking a breather here in the Santa Monica sunshine."" What a lovely phrase that is to read.
""Let me say above all else, the most important thing I've learned from you has got to be your well-rounded approach to investing and through that approach being fully invested with one major twist, taking that same mindset and applying the lessons to my craft as an entrepreneur."" Eric writes, ""Is individualized conscious capitalism a thing? Because I'm about to make it a thing. I want to be fully invested in my craft and my art as an ever-evolving composer,"" which is what Eric is. Just to answer that small question right up front, I'm going to say individualized conscious capitalism, sure, that's a thing.
What I said earlier about being purpose-driven, I feel as if that's in part what you're saying. You're wanting to be fully invested in what you do, believing not just in the paychecks we get, but in the outcome of our work and to keep with my May theme that it matters. He goes on, ""I've successfully built an investment portfolio I'm happy with, albeit a recently demolished portfolio courtesy of hours of research I've put in and thoughtfulness with regards to business development and growth and listening to the Fool over the last few years has taught me meticulous discipline about how to approach the long game. Obviously,"" Eric writes, ""the only game that matters, and while I've made some mistakes, they were mistakes well worth making to know what not to do in the future.
Who's to say one can't apply the same? Just keep swimming. Realistic optimism lead a more interesting life, smarter, happier, richer to their everyday job. Well, for the first time ever I took a chance on Twitter,"" Eric concludes, ""and I sent a cold direct message to a director who is actively crowdsourcing for a new project in which I was extremely interested. He responded over Twitter in about 60 seconds, we chatted about ideas and the timeline, and it looks like I'll be scoring three commercials for him. If those go well, I'll be scoring in the upcoming YouTube series, Just Incredible. Thank you, David for allowing me the opportunity to become a more focused, hopeful, and adventurous version of myself and allowing me to become smarter, happier, and richer in the process. You've got a wonderful gift of inspiring those around you and it's affected me more than you'll probably ever know, my Foolish best, Eric Devore."" Well, I love hearing about your success, Eric and I love in particular that anecdote about taking a little risk, doing something you'd never done, direct messaging a director on Twitter and what seems to have come from it.
Put in mind that that old Wayne Gretzky line paraphrasing, you miss 100 percent of the shots you never take, you took a shot and you led a more interesting life and you're benefiting, it sounds like from the outcome. But really I just want to, in closing on this one, highlight the application of our Foolish principles, not just to investing, but to business and to life. That's what you are underlining here, Eric, and I could relate. A lot of the investment approach I've taken involves doing the opposite of what other people do with their money. So many people either don't invest at all so I invest, or others trade. They jump in and out and I do something very different, I invest. That same contrariety, taking the contrary approach in investing, yes I think it does work in business and in life. In business, I can say taking the name The Motley Fool is a good business example of using Foolish principles and taking the contrarian approach and I think it's worked really well for us. When we first named our newsletter The Motley Fool, a number of my friends thought, are you just trying to joke with people or it sounds like you're an idiot.
Why would you want to call yourself an idiot? Especially because people say things like this has been set for decades, maybe centuries, a fool and his money are soon parted. Why would you guys call yourselves The Motley Fool? Well I hope some of those reasons are now evident 30-years later and why we take a lot of pride and are so grateful and I speak, I think for all 630 employees of the Fool, we love calling ourselves Fools and I think I'm speaking for a lot more than 630 when I talk to listeners of this podcast from one week to the next, many of whom sign off their own work with Fool on, foolishly, I became a Fool on this day or this month. Yes, that means a great deal to me. No, it would never happen if we hadn't called this enterprise The Motley Fool. Breaking rules really does work not just in investing, but in business and certainly in life as well. Eric, I love sharing your note because I think you are good exemplar. Let's do two more Rule Breaker Mailbag item number 7.
This one is for Mark [inaudible 00:44:52]. Mark, thank you. ""David, one of the things I really appreciate about you is your stalwart optimism, especially when,"" Mark writes ""my very rule breakery portfolio is down 51 percent since February of 2021. It really does help me to hear you talk about Amazon going from 95-7 in 2001 to gain perspective."" I'm about to cue myself, no, I won't talking about watching my Amazon going from 95-7 in 2001. Yeah, it was all real, it all happened and I kept holding all the way through to today. Many other Fools have done so for that stock and many others, I hope you find that inspiring. It's really important to know things can drop that far and they will come back. Over time, if you found a great company, it will come back far more than that.
Anyway, let me pick up Mark's note, ""What has me concerned now though, is the idea that 'this time it's different'. I listen to a lot of podcasts and one person I've heard interviews with several times who really made an impression on me was the geopolitical strategist, Peter Zeihan. He's a very smart guy. The thesis of his new book is that the Pax Americana post-war period, especially since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union, has been an aberration in history and will not be repeated going forward. He believes that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is the last battle of the cold war and that it signals the end of the era of globalization and free trade. In a previous book eight years ago,"" Mark writes, ""he predicted that this invasion would happened in 2022. He now foresees an era of our retreat to nationalism.
""Baby boomers retiring and pulling their money out of the market, and general economic shrinkage due to the decline in global birth rates. He also predicts widespread famine as result of the Ukraine invasion. Not a pretty picture. Now, I'm faced with a choice of two competing narratives. On the one hand is the David Gardner optimistic narrative, which says this period is just a natural part of long-term market cycles, just like the dot-com crash or the Great Recession. It's just something to be endured because 'this too shall pass'. On the other hand, is the global geopolitical shift narrative, which says, this is the end of the globalized era we grew up in and the start of a radical step backwards for humanity. Needless to say the two narratives lead in very different directions in terms of investment choices sincerely, Mark [inaudible 00:47:30] .""
Mark calls himself a Fool, wondering if he's being small f, foolish. Well, I really appreciate you sharing that perspective and it was a pleasure to feature that on this week's mailbag, Mark. I first of all, encourage not just you, but everybody listening to me right now to read widely and to think deeply. I think Peter Zeihan and a lot of people might be wondering, how do you spell this man's name if they wanted to Google him and learn more about him. It's Z-E-I-H-A-N. Peter Zeihan clearly contributes to that reading widely and thinking deeply. While what I'll call geopolitical chess games, I wouldn't be a very good player of them myself and I'm definitely not a very good predictor of geopolitical chess. It's not for me. I still want to say the act of thinking about these things, asking, is it different this time in many different contexts.
I think the old cliche is, it's not different this time. I think country wisdom always suggests you should never ask that question in the first place because everything has been done more than once as we circle the sun. Most of my great quotes probably just go back to the Greeks anyway, and so it's never different this time. I think some of the thinking goes until you start encountering, I don't know. How about the Black Swan thinking of Nicholas Nassim Taleb or others who pointed out that some unusual things do happen. They're not part of cycles and they can change history forever. I think you have to respect that.
So I strongly believe that the future is not predictable, but I also strongly believe that it tends,, for rational reasons, to be better than people think. Earlier in this podcast, I mentioned Matt Ridley, his book, looking across the long arc of history, seeing how consistently speaking of consistency, humanity thinks things are going to be worse. I would even say if some of the things you just shared end up being true. Peter Zeihan has spent a lot more time thinking about this. This is his profession than I have. I would still be the person saying, OK, so the world is changing forever. We're going back to nationalism, if that's the case, will that still has implications for yes, your money and mine, but it doesn't at all suggest that there won't be great new start-ups, great companies doing great things.
In fact, one potential Black Swan I've sometimes thought about is the idea that all of these borders that we've grown up with the sense that you can draw a hard border right in the sand and say that's one country and on the other side that's another country, that geopolitical world that I grew up within the cold war, I sometimes wonder if that will lose some relevance over the course of time. Apple these days has a larger bank account, than some sovereign nations' GDP. When you really look at some of the largest corporations in the world, and I'm talking about this in an optimistic way, I think they're, like Apple, doing remarkable work solving problems that a lot of us have that governments can't solve for us.
I look at a future where I see a stronger private sector driven by conscious capitalism. I see conscious capitalism much more successful making inroads in business. That I think conscious politics is these days in politics so that again, only makes me favor business even more in terms of creating real solutions and doing good things in this world. I think in the USA, we practice conscious capitalism as a country. We're not perfect, but we do it better than anybody else in the world. So even if some of the things that you're describing do come true it won't make me think. I don't want to be an investor anymore. The narrative of baby boomers retiring and pulling their money out of the market has been put out there for a long time.
Now, I remember Harry Dent selling a lot of books bearishly talking about how this is going to crash the market. Baby boomers pulling their money out of the markets, where is that money going to go? Well, they're going to spend it, it's going to go back into the pockets of businesses. We're going to grow and over the course of time, some of that money will be handed down to the next generation, next-generation after that, I don't see a cataclysmic point in time where we all realized that the baby boomers are going to pull their money out of the markets and everything is going to crash.
Maybe it's been happening slowly. In fact, it has been probably for the last decade or so, it will probably continue for another decade. It might tamp down the markets and maybe it already is, but it's not something that I live in fear of. I will say in closing, pessimism always sounds smart and pessimism sells. Optimism, by contrast, often sounds naive. But in my experience, it wins. I'd rather have something that wins over something that sells. But in the end, Mark, and everybody listening to me right now, each of us is left with our own decisions, derived from the opinions that we ended up with, the choices that we made. There probably isn't one right choice or right idea that I could give right now through this podcast that would even work for everybody, so somebody's idea can lead to a good choice for them. That same idea given to somebody else could lead to a bad choice for them. I guess, the world is a lot grayer and more complex than deep blacks and bright whites. I think there's a lot more complexity to this. I really do appreciate brilliant people who can help us see the big picture, and perhaps, Peter Zeihan is one of them.
Sounds like he's been doing it for some people, and probably, he's worth listening to. I want to make it clear, I have a very open mind about things, and I like it when people have the guts to put forward a vision of the future, and be accountable for it. But I'll always be the one saying, ""Whatever you're telling me about, I bet I can find a good investment within that context, so let's buy and hold, Foolishly. Thanks, Mark. Closing us out this month, Deborah Monahan's, note. Thank you, Deborah. Rule Breaker mailbag item number 8. ""Hi, David. Sometime in the mid 1990s, I attended a Tony Robbins conference. I'll do my best to recall the details. They may be fuzzy. It was after all the mid 1990s, but your point stuck with me. The conference was somewhere in the Northeast. I was living in New York at the time. I believe it may have been New Jersey or Connecticut."" Full-stop right there, I'll tell you right now. Deborah, it was in Hartford, Connecticut. I'll never forget that day, thereby, hanging a tail.
But Deborah continues, ""You and Tom both spoke at the conference with your court jester hats on."" I do believe both Barbara Walters and Donald Trump spoke at the same conference, but it may have been another event, and full-stop there once again. I also think, not only did they speak there, Deborah, but I think Alex Rodriguez, A-Rod, the famous Yankees infielder spoke there too. In fact, before I go back to your story, I think, I'm going to have to tell a little bit of a story around this. Because I already told you, I'll never forget that day. Tom and I used to do a lot of paid speeches, especially in an earlier era of the Fool, where that kind of money that you could make from speeches, speaking to corporations or conferences, was really significant for us at the time. It helped our small topline at The Motley Fool, it's not as important today. We don't do this much anymore, but we had many fun memories, and you've just unlocked one of them. Tom and I signed on for a two-speech deal. I believe, the year was 2000, because the name of the conference was Results 2000.
Our speaking agent at the time showed us some pretty handsome speaker's fees. It was not usual for us to sign on to a two-gig deal, one of them in Seattle, the other in Hartford, but we said, sure, we'll do it. In fact, the first one was in Seattle, and that's really the story I'm going to tell. As we are driving from the airport, having recently landed, we're in the middle of a book tour as well. We've been very busy, we probably were late the night before at Barnes & Noble, we're a little tired. All of a sudden we realized, we were on our way to give our first speech in Seattle for the Results 2000 conference. We noticed that we were being driven to KeyArena. That's what it said in our itinerary.
I think it was Tom who leaned forward to the cabbie and said to the cab driver, ""KeyArena, is that where the Seattle SuperSonics basketball team plays?"" The cab driver said, ""Yeah, there's a whole Robbins gig going on at the stadium today."" All of a sudden, Tom and I realized that we weren't just going to be speaking to a couple of hundred people at somebody's offsite corporate conference, we were actually going to be speaking to a sold-out KeyArena in Seattle that morning. We started scrambling, changing up our notes, and stories, and thinking what the implications of this would be. I'm about to give you in short form here, Deborah, our brush with Tony Robbins.
The first thing that we did is we arrived at KeyArena, we were met by Tony's chief of staff, very nice, attractive young woman. As we reached out our hands, we already had our Jester caps on, just to shake our hand. She immediately lifted her hand up from the normal shaking position, and it had it just off of her shoulder, and it became clear, we're going to be high-fiving her, which we did. Then she said, ""Let me show you through to Tony. He's just back here."" She showed us through to Tony Robbins, our noble host, and there was Tony. Just as we start to shake his hand, he immediately lifts his hand up and he's got him up over his shoulder, we're high-fiving Tony. Tony had a huge mid of a hand, but we started to realize everybody who works for Tony, they do the high-fives. They don't do the handshakes, the old-school routine we've been raised. Anyway, as it turned out, at both KeyArena and in the Hartford Civic Center where you attended, we spoke to the two largest in-house audiences we have ever spoken to. Tom and I have given many talks over the years. These days we'll speak, can't wait to do this again to Motley Fool members. We might have 750 people come to join us in Washington DC as we did a few years ago. I know we'll do that again sometime soon. About 20,000 people greater than signed 750. There, Tom and I were charging out onto the stage, it's like how they set up rock musicians in conference arenas. You're down a little stage there, but there's confetti, dry ice, and blooms blowing up all around us as we come out to talk to the Results 2000 audience about investing in the stock market.
It maybe not quite as exciting as a rock concert, but certainly a fond memory. Deborah, you're taking me back there because I just gave you the KeyArena version. But a week or two later, we went to Hartford Civic Center, and that's where you were at that day, and I'm going to read the rest of your note now. I also want to note that our mother was in attendance that day. She lived in Vermont and drove down. I'm not sure mom saw many of our speeches, but I remember how hugely amused, and I think, somewhat proud she was to see her two sons wearing Jester caps, tiny little figures on the stage way down from where she was in section 511, making up the numbers, and she always looked back on that with fondness. She is no longer with us, but she loved that we were there that day at the Hartford Civic Center speaking with the Robbin's crowd.
Now, back to Deborah's note. ""You told a story that day about a client whom you talked to about investing in companies that one knows and believes in. In trying to illustrate the point you asked about that guy's passions and his hobbies and the name Harley-Davidson came up. You then proceeded to show this client what his dollars would be worth if he'd started to invest in HD 20 years prior. Again, the details may be fuzzy, but the point,"" Deborah writes, ""stuck. Invest in good companies and start with taking a look at companies you're familiar with, loyal to, and/or passionate about. If I'm continuously spending my money with the company and happy to do so, you can bet it's got at least a small portion of my portfolio these days, writes Deborah, and I love this, she says, for me, those companies include Starbucks, Disney, Costco, T-Mobile, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Intuit, Visa, Home Depot, Delta Airlines, Marriott, and Toyota. Well, I moved to Alexandria, Virginia. That's where Fool HQ is based by the way. In 2005, I saw your building sign over the years always recalling the two of you in your Jester hats at that conference and the Harley-Davidson's story.
""During the pandemic, The Motley Fool came full circle for me, when an ad crossed my computer and I started to look at your subscription services, and since April of 2020, I've been a member of The Motley Fool, I've added positions in CrowdStrike, Nvidia, Shopify, Axon, The Trade Desk, Twilio, and some of your other favourites. It's been a fun ride. Thank you for being so impressionable on a young mind. To help this older mind live a life filled with happiness and many types of wealth. Much love, Deborah Monahan."" Well, from Tom and from me and from our whole company, Deborah, I say much love back to you.
I love that you shared that story. You occasioned that dear memory for me as well, which I just shared, and so how could I not end this painful month of May with that delightful reflection. I'm so glad that you, using the power of time and thinking back now more than 20 years, that you took to heart this notion that the great companies, the really great companies of your time, that make the products and services that you appreciate, that you could become a part-owner of them through the miracle of the stock market, and that as a fellow Fool, you would let those positions persists, built up over time in good markets and even in bad like the one we're living through right now. But then you see their awards, and as you said it, ""To live a life filled with happiness and many types of wealth.""

Tech stocks are up and gaining this week but the results gave a much-needed push to NVDA stock. It’s been trading between $185 and $190 this week and it still looks cheap to me.
The tech giant has massive potential and if you can ignore the short-term hurdles, the bigger picture looks promising. NVDA stock looks fairly valued at the current level.
Despite macroeconomic conditions, the company managed to deliver growth for investors.
I had recommended a buy in my previous coverage of the stock when it was trading at $169, if you had made the move, you could be sitting on gains of more than 10%, but it’s still not too late to own the stock. 
7 High-Yielding Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy in June
The management projection for the second quarter didn’t meet expectations, but no company can be immune to the problems faced by the economy.
Nvidia said the revenue growth should decelerate 25% year over year. I believe the data center will be in focus for the second half of the year and it will drive NVDA tock. It has already managed to start off on a high note in the previous quarters. 
A Closer Look at NVDA Stock
The most impressive number in the quarterly results is the 83% year-over-year growth in the data center business, it was up from 71% in the fourth quarter.
Nvidia has already set a gold standard in the gaming sector but it is in the growth stage in the data center segment and there is massive potential.
The biggest driver is the reliance on cloud providers and the rise in the number of data centers being built today.
This is not to say that the business in other segments will drop. I am certain the company will continue to drive growth across various sectors but the data center will be a major contributor and Nvidia will gain an edge in the industry.
It offers complete solutions for the data centers right from the software to the hardware and applications. The industry is booming and this means the company will remain in demand for many years to come.
The Bottom Line
Vivek Arya, a Bank of America analyst considers NVDA stock as a top large-cap semiconductor and is bullish on it. Further, Evercore analyst C.J. Muse also has a buy rating on the stock post the quarterly results with a price target of $300. 
I believe NVDA stock could be one of the top tech stocks for the long term. Do not worry about the short-term ups and downs and hold on to the stock. It has the potential to generate returns in the long run.

2022-06-09 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks That Could Be Worth More Than Meta by 2032,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-that-could-be-worth-more-than-meta-by-2032,"There's no denying Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: FB) -- the company formerly known as Facebook -- has been a rewarding stock. Even with their near-halving of its stock price just since September of last year, shares are still on the order of 1,000% above their post-IPO low hit in 2012.
But past performance is no guarantee of future results. The next 10 years could look very different than the past 10 have. And given that Meta's flagship social networking site Facebook is starting to show signs of slowing growth, odds are a little too good the company's next 10 years could indeed be lackluster. It may be time to start looking for names with more verifiable growth prospects rather than sticking with companies going on the defensive.
With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three different stocks that can actually answer the question, ""What have you done for me lately?"" All of them could easily be worth more than Meta come 2032.

1. Nvidia
You may know it as a brand name for computer graphics cards loved by video gamers, although you'll find its tech inside general-purpose PCs and laptops as well. And its hold on a sizable piece of this market is pretty secure. The bigger growth engine you may be overlooking with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), however, is its data center processing business. Of last quarter's $8.3 billion worth of revenue Nvidia generated, a little over $3.7 billion of it came from data center operators looking for newer, better technologies. In fact, with 83% year-over-year revenue growth, data centers are now Nvidia's biggest business.
And this is just the beginning.
As it turns out, the same processing architecture that powers graphics cards is also well suited for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, which is a fast-growing market, to say the least. Technology market research outfit Polaris forecasts the AI infrastructure market is set to grow at an average annual pace of more than 27% between now and 2030.
Nvidia is poised to capture more than its fair share of this growth. Its DGX A100 systems, for instance, are designed and built from the ground up specifically for the AI market. Enterprises love what it can do for their artificial intelligence development efforts too, ranging from energy management to medical imaging to combatting future pandemics, just to name a few.
2. Adobe
Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) is another technology company that's so much more than it used to be, without many investors even realizing it.
You'll likely recognize Adobe as the name behind the software allowing the web's users to effectively manage PDFs (portable document files); some people may also know that Adobe's Photoshop software largely pioneered the digital image and creation software market. And both are still around.
The company has moved well beyond graphics software and online document management, though. It's now waist-deep into businesses that help enterprises with websites optimize every aspect of their web presence. A cloud-based platform called Creative Cloud dramatically expands what the original Photoshop can do, while the company's Experience Cloud provides tools allowing a website to be customized for each particular user. Content management, e-commerce, and marketing campaigns are also part of this platform's repertoire. In fact, without even realizing it, it's possible you've visited a website ultimately customized by Adobe's tools.
Notably, Experience Cloud and Creative Cloud are offered on a subscription basis. While their monthly fee is relatively small, it's recurring revenue, meaning Adobe doesn't have to constantly come up with newer versions of its software, rebox them, and then hope that customers purchase an update. This shifting business model is one of the big reasons revenue is consistently growing at a double-digit pace. The top line is expected to improve by 13% this year before accelerating to early 15% growth next year, underscoring the idea that there's still plenty of business to be won.
3. Salesforce
Finally, add Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) to your list of stocks that could be worth more than Meta 10 years from now.
Salesforce was one of the web's earliest cloud computing names, launching all the way back in 1999, well before the term ""cloud computing"" became common. Given how much time has passed since then and how much new competition has crept into the customer relationship management software space, it would be easy to assume this company's best days are behind it. And as far as its high-growth days are concerned, they are in the past.
For a 23-year-old company, though, Salesforce still has a surprising number of tricks up its sleeve. Improvements like the expansion of task-automation tools and allowing users to directly interface with the popular social media platform TikTok are just a couple of updated reasons the analyst community is calling for revenue growth of 20% this year.
The stock's not cheap, mind you, priced at more than 40 times this fiscal year's expected per-share earnings. With those earnings expected to grow to the tune of 22% next year in step with a projected 18% revenue growth, though, this stock is arguably worth its premium price.

2022-06-10 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Unveils New Product Portfolio to Accelerate Growth,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-unveils-new-product-portfolio-to-accelerate-growth,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD recently unveiled a plethora of new products as the company outlined its strategy to expand its product portfolio to address new markets, accelerate data center growth, and enter the AI and AR space.
On its Financial Analyst Day, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su had laid out the company’s strategy to capture a significant share of the $300 billion market of high-performance and adaptive products. This strategy will help the company drive revenue growth and enhance shareholders return.
AMD is expanding its multi-generational CPU core, graphics, and adaptive computing architecture roadmaps with new product launches. Some of the notable product launches include the Zen 4 CPU, the Zen 5 CPU and the AMD RDNA 3 gaming architecture.
On the Data Center front, AMD’s acquisition of Pensando Systems is expanding AMD’s data center product portfolio. AMD’s Pensando DPUs are on track to become the world’s most intelligent and performant DPUs with its zero-trust security solutions and advanced packet processor.
AMD’s acquisition of Xilinx is accelerating its growth in the AI and AR space. The company is integrating Xilinx’s AI engine with AMD Ryzen and AMD EPYC for small and midsize AI models that will help it expand into the uncharted AR space.
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus

AMD Diverse Product Portfolio is Driving Top Line
AMD is leading its peers in high-performance computing (HPC) as the company is enabling customers across various fields like manufacturing, life sciences, financial services, climate research, and more to utilize supercomputers for research purposes.
It is worth mentioning that AMD powers five of the top ten most powerful and eight of the top ten most energy-efficient supercomputers globally.
Recently, AMD partnered with Hewlett Packard HPE and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory to build the world’s fastest and most energy-efficient supercomputer — Frontier.
AMD has ventured into the AR space with its recent collaboration with Meta Platforms META.
AMD’s collaboration with Meta will aid the company in transitioning out of the slowing pc market and concentrate on the semi-custom chip business, which will help to expand in high-growth markets like the Metaverse, which is anticipated to reach a market value of $426.9 billion by 2027 according to Bloomberg.
Although AMD is venturing into new markets, the company has been facing stiff competition across all of its business segments. Specifically, AMD has been facing significant competition from NVIDIA NVDA as it forays into the HPC market.
NVIDIA’s superchips have been benefiting from the rapid proliferation of AI. By applying its CPUs and superchips in AI models, the company is expanding its base in untapped markets like climate science, energy research, space exploration and digital biology.
Further, global supply chain challenges in the semiconductor industry and intense competition have impacted the stock price negatively.
Shares of AMD, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have fallen 31.3% compared with the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors  industry’s and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 18.8% and 24.2%, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
AMD has been gaining from strong demand for its Ryzen and EPYC server processors, courtesy of the increasing proliferation of AI and Machine Learning (ML) in industries like cloud, gaming and data center. This, in turn, impacted the first-quarter 2022 revenues positively.
In the last reported quarter, AMD generated revenues of $5.89 billion, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.73% and surged 71% year over year. The company anticipates AMD revenues to improve as it forays into the HPC market. This, in turn, will impact shareholders' wealth positively.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-06-13 00:00:00+00:00,"1 Semiconductor Stock with 141% Upside, According to Wall Street",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-semiconductor-stock-with-141-upside-according-to-wall-street,"The technology sector is heavily beaten down this year. The Nasdaq-100 index has fallen 30% year to date, placing it firmly in bear market territory as investors reprice their expectations for growth amid rapidly rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions.
When the market is this volatile, it can be hard to separate the high-quality opportunities from the stocks that could suffer even steeper losses. But taking note of Wall Street's recommendations can sometimes be a guiding light in difficult times, especially when they put forward a company with strong growth and big profits that is operating in one of the hottest industries in the world.
Semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) ticks all the boxes, and here's why one Wall Street investment firm thinks its stock price could more than double in value from here.
Image source: Getty Images.
Transitioning beyond hardware
The semiconductor industry is now one of the most important in the world. More of the economy continues to shift online, which means advanced computer chips are required to power data centers in addition to a growing number of devices consumers use to access the digital realm.
Gaming and data center remain Nvidia's two largest segments, accounting for 88% of its revenue in the recent first quarter of fiscal 2023 (which ended May 1). The data center segment is of particular note because it represents a piece of infrastructure that not only stores information, but can also analyze it to help companies extract valuable insights.
Thanks to advancements in chip technology like Nvidia's Grace architecture, enormous volumes of data can be processed and used to train artificial intelligence, and also to render digital twins of real-world assets. These digital twins can be built with Nvidia's Omniverse platform, a 3D rendering tool that is currently used by giants like Amazon to mimic its real-life fulfillment centers with millimeter accuracy. It helps Amazon carefully plan physical adjustments before spending time and money reconfiguring the actual floor plan.
That's important because Nvidia no longer wants to be known as a chipmaker alone, but also as a platform computing company. Its future extends beyond hardware. In another example, it has developed self-driving technology so powerful that it's being adopted by 35 different car manufacturers and will hit the road as soon as 2024. It's an industry that could be worth $2.1 trillion by 2030 -- five times the size of Nvidia's current market valuation, yet it's only one small area the company operates in right now.
A long-term growth story
Nvidia is a financial powerhouse and is experiencing a notable upswing in its annual revenue and earnings per share results. Fiscal 2022 was the company's biggest year ever, and it's set to back that up with an even stronger result in the current fiscal 2023, according to analysts' estimates. However, because the numbers continue to balloon, the rate of growth is expected to slow in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.
Nvidia's annual non-GAAP earnings per share, which removes one-off costs and share-based compensation, continues to set all-time highs. And in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the metric jumped 49% compared to the year-ago period. That was after deducting a one-time, $1.35 billion charge from its failed acquisition of SoftBank's Arm holdings due to regulatory challenges.
Yet as mentioned, Nvidia might be on the cusp of a new phase of growth in the coming decade from its smaller segments, which are still in their infancy compared to its booming gaming and data center businesses.
Wall Street is on board
Given Nvidia's prospects, it's not surprising that Wall Street investment analysts maintain a bullish tone even in the face of the broader sell-off in the technology sector, which has helped push the stock down by 51% from its all-time high. Of the 47 analysts who cover Nvidia, just one recommends selling.
But one firm, in particular, Tigress Financial Partners, thinks the stock price could soar to $410, which represents 141% upside from where it trades today.
Yet as Nvidia continues to drive advancements in the most exciting areas of the technology sector, there's an argument to be made that Tigress' price target might actually be conservative over the long term.

2022-06-14 00:00:00+00:00,Adobe revamps metaverse design tools for Apple's chips,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/adobe-revamps-metaverse-design-tools-for-apples-chips,"By Stephen Nellis
June 14 (Reuters) - Adobe Inc ADBE.O on Tuesday said it has reworked several of its tools for creating three-dimensional content to make them work well on Apple Inc AAPL.O computers that use the iPhone maker's proprietary ""M"" series chips.
Adobe has long been a major player providing software in creative fields like photography, graphic design and film. But Adobe has been working to build out more tools for making the three-dimensional worlds and objects used in video games and, increasingly, the so-called metaverse, where companies like Meta Platforms Inc FB.O are hoping to use augmented reality technology to overlay digital content on the real world.
Adobe acquired software tools called Substance 3D in 2019 when it bought French firm Allegorithmic for an undisclosed sum. The tool helps the makers of movies like ""Frozen 2"" and games imbue the digital objects they create with a wide array of lifelike textures, like wood or leather.
Adobe said that it has reworked the software so that it will run on Apple's proprietary chips, a move that is likely to help Apple gain some ground of its own. While Apple's laptops and desktop are widely used in some creative fields like music production, game developers tend to still rely on PCs that can be paired with power graphics chips from Nvidia Corp NVDA.O that help graphics look more realistic.
But Apple's new chips have added new graphics processing power, and Adobe plans to take full advantage of it in the new software, said Francois Cottin, senior director of marketing at Adobe.
""For these kinds of use cases, vertical integration is really key, from the app all the way to the chip,"" Cottin said. ""We've been working very closely with Apple on future-looking use cases. I think Substance 3D definitely represent that.""
Adobe also said Tuesday that it had signed up new customers for its three-dimensional content creation tools, including German fashion brand Hugo Boss and outdoor footwear brand Salomon Group.

We’ve seen a chip favorite get demolished, as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has not been able to fight off the selling pressure in the stock market. While Nvidia was hitting new highs in November 2021, the selloff eventually hit this name too. At its recent low, NVDA stock was down 55% from the highs.
Does that make it a back-up-the-truck situation? As much as I’ve been an advocate for such situations in the past — like Nvidia being “a steal” below $50 — this environment is different. When Nvidia was a steal, we had a knee-jerk, panic reaction to Covid-19.
In this environment we have a hawkish Federal Reserve, persistently high inflation, supply chain problems and geopolitical issues — among other things. Put simply, we are in a tough environment and this time, the Fed doesn’t have our back. Does that mean Nvidia stock is a sell? No. It just means I don’t view this as an aggressive all-in situation. Not to mention that NVDA stock is still up about 300% from the “steal” levels highlighted two years ago.

Accumulate NVDA Stock
Instead of going all-in on the stock at current levels, I like the idea of accumulating NVDA stock. That’s not a plan I came up with today, it’s something I’ve been looking at for weeks now.
Also known as dollar-cost averaging (DCA), this can be a highly effective method for investors. That’s especially true when we’re talking about high-quality companies, which Nvidia is. Accumulating the stock or using DCA lets us average into a position. It removes the stress and potential pain of piling into the stock at a specific level.
Since 1950, the S&P 500 has delivered a win-rate north of 82% when we include the dividends and its up years outpace the down years. In short, it favors long-term investors who DCA their funds. That doesn’t guarantee that Nvidia will do well, but its business is strong and that should ensure that its long-term performance pays off for patient buyers.
Nvidia’s Business Is Robust
The world feels like it’s going to hell in a hand basket, doesn’t it? That attitude is being reflected in the stock market, which has had one of its worst starts to the year in many decades. For Nvidia though, the company is doing pretty well.
7 Cryptos on Red Alert As the Bear Market May Be Upon Us
Analysts expect 26% revenue growth this year, with estimates calling for double-digit revenue growth in each of the next four years. And remember, analysts have been embarrassingly conservative with their estimates over the last few years. That goes for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) as well.
As for earnings, estimates call for 22% growth this year and 19% next year. But that’s odd, isn’t it?
How many high-quality companies are growing revenue and earnings in excess of 20% this year? Not many and yet, NVDA stock has experienced a peak-to-trough decline beyond 50%. It has been halved, yet estimates have hardly budged.
This company is still doing quite well, regardless of what the stock does. That’s because Nvidia caters to long-term, secular industry trends. Those trends include things like cloud-computing, supercomputing, datacenters, artificial intelligence and machine learning, gaming, graphics, drones, robotics, the metaverse, autonomous driving and more.
Sure, some of those end-markets may experience a short-term pullback in spending, but generally speaking, the investments will continue. Just because the economy slows, doesn’t mean there is less data being created. It doesn’t mean people want slower or worse-performing technology.
Profitability Justifies Valuation
Because the stock has been halved, NVDA stock now trades at a more reasonable 33 times this year’s earnings. To some investors, that valuation may seem too high, but how much do we pay for a best-in-breed firm with double-digit earnings and revenue growth?
The company commands powerful margins, as it blends hardware and software in its offerings. Specifically, it generates 65% gross profit margin and 32% net profit margin. Do you realize how that stacks up in tech?
Let’s put it this way: Nvidia generates higher net margins than all of the FAANG stocks.
At its low, NVDA stock trades at 29 times earnings. Is that a low enough price? Do we need 25 times earnings (about $140 a share)? Is it lower than that?
Valuations aren’t an exact science. If they were, there would be no need to dissect the market. It would all be one solvable math equation. That’s clearly not how it works, which is why I like the DCA method with high-quality companies.
Low-Risk Trade on Nvidia Stock

For those who want a low-risk setup in NVDA stock, keep an eye on $180. Since the stock broke out over downtrend resistance (blue line) and reclaimed the 10-day and 21-day moving averages, it has been holding up above $180.
Bulls can be long against that level. More aggressive longs can use the $175 level instead. If it loses the latter, it loses its short-term moving averages too.
Below $175 and NVDA stock may retest the $160 lows, where it previously hammered out a nice bottom. For DCA investors, they don’t have to worry about the levels as much.

Twitter Stock In Focus Following WSJ Report Regarding Elon Musk Plans To Confirm Acquisition
On the social media front today, Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) is once again in the limelight. Overall, this likely stems from a recent Wall Street Journal (WSJ) piece on Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s plans to acquire the firm. According to the report, Musk will likely be going through with his takeover of Twitter. This could come as positive news for some as choppy exchanges between Musk and Twitter have been drawing concerns regarding the viability of the deal. Among the most recent happenings would be Musk’s claims of Twitter breaching the agreement terms. The Tesla CEO highlighted that the company was doing this by withholding information about bot accounts on the platform.
Nevertheless, the WSJ writes that Musk is going to announce this at his first meeting with Twitter’s employees. This would be referring to the all-hands meeting set for today by CEO Parag Agrawal. Via the hour-long meeting, Musk is planning to answer questions from employees. Among the key focuses will likely be the Tesla CEO’s opinions on remote work, hiring changes, and even the status of former President Donald Trump’s ban. Accordingly, these concerns among others would not be all that surprising. After all, Musk has been and remains very vocal about his stance on all these issues. As investors look to see how things play out, TWTR stock could be worth checking out today.

Tesla Raises Car Model Prices Across The Board In U.S. Market
In other Elon Musk-related news, Tesla is reportedly raising the prices of its EVs in the U.S. again. For the most part, this is likely the company’s means of keeping up with ongoing global supply chain problems. Not to mention, Tesla, like many other businesses, is feeling the heat from rising material costs across the board too. In detail, growing lithium and aluminum prices would, in theory, weigh in on Tesla’s manufacturing costs. Pair this with an EV industry chip shortage and this move would not be all too surprising from Tesla’s end.
Getting straight into it, the EV titan is increasing the price of its Model Y long-range vehicle to $65,990. This would represent an increase of about 5% from its previous price of $62,990. Weighing in on this would be investment firm Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS). According to the brokerage, “While some concerned price hikes will destroy demand, for now Tesla remains supply constrained.” All in all, this would serve to echo Elon Musk’ statements about having a “super bad feeling,” about the economy affecting operations from last month. The likes of which saw Musk halting all hiring worldwide for Tesla. As the company continues to adapt to the challenging business environment, investors may be considering TSLA stock.

In this video clip from ""The Rank"" on Motley Fool Live, recorded on June 6, Fool.com contributors Jamie Louko and Jason Hall examine several key factors that will drive the technology company to greater heights in the future.
10 stocks we like better than Nvidia
When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*
They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of June 2, 2022
Jamie Louko: It is, you know, a market dominator in the GPU, graphics processing unit space. It's a chipmaker and it's in a lot of these really important industries or at least industries that I think are going to be much bigger 20 years from now than they are today. Things like gaming, data center, automotive, not necessarily all vehicles, although it does do that, but more autonomous driving, artificial intelligence, visualization, and they are a leader in most of these markets.
They are the No. 1 in PC gaming with more than three times the revenue than other GPU vendors. In terms of graphics, they have about 90% market share. They are the leader in deep learning AI markets. Also supercomputing with 355 of the top 500 companies in the space. They're dominant in so many of these industries that I think are going to be much bigger going forward.
For example, the gaming market is worth about $100 billion today and Unity (NYSE: U) a company I just talked about, expects this industry to grow to $300 billion by 2027. That's just an example of, I really think that Nvidia is this leading gold standard pick and shovel play into all of these industries that I am very bullish on, and instead of trying to pick which companies I believe are going to succeed in each of these industries, I think that Nvidia is that company that will enable all of these industries to flourish and just Nvidia will benefit from all of this growth going forward.
Not to mention [laughs] its financials are stellar. Revenue grew 42% to $8.3 billion in a quarter not to mention, its impressive free cash flow and net income. Now, its net income decreased 15% year over year, but that was because of the Arm acquisition that fell through. It was planning on acquiring Arm that got terminated, it got denied, and therefore, it had a tax impact of about $1.4 billion.
Jason Hall: It had a bad breakup. Big breakup fee.
Louko: Yeah $1.4 billion breakup fee, Jason. If you exclude that, their non-GAAP, net income margin was 41% for the quarter, really strong there. They are generating tons of free cash flow, which is what I love to see. They're going to be able to reinvest that into gaining more market share, continuing to innovate keep that gold standard status so what's the concern?
Really for me, the main concern is valuation. Their price of free cash flow, their price-to-earnings ratios are through the roof, even their price-to-sales ratio is above 16 times sales. This is not a cheap company, but for me personally, when it comes to high-quality businesses like this, I tend to not care about valuation, and I'll just invest multiple times as the company gets a lower and lower valuation. It's a company that I want to own and I was going to try to buy it today, but alas so [laughs] that's why I ranked it No. 1 today.
Hall: I ranked this lower than anybody else and it was entirely on valuation. Everything Jamie said is absolutely true. It is a wonderful business. It's going to be more important 10 years from now than it's ever been, but it trades for 61 times free cash flow.
Even adjusting for that it's the breakup money, it's a very expensive stock. If your time horizon is long enough, that risk of overpaying goes down. Particularly, like Jamie was saying if you can buy more and more over time. I added to this one in February, wish I had waited a little bit that's the only reason for me I ranked it as low as I did.

Markets tried to rebound from a selling week, but investors were wary of the stubbornly high inflation and braced for an impending recession. Fed chairman Jerome Powell reaffirmed the central bank’s bid to bring down inflation to its target 2%, fueling fears of further interest rate hikes. Oil prices plunged to a two-week low. Two of the three major stock indexes ended in the green, while the Dow ended in the red. Markets remained closed on Monday as the United States commemorated the end of slavery by observing Juneteenth.
How Did The Benchmarks Perform?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) dipped 0.1% or 38.29 points to close at 29,888.78. Seventeen components of the 30-stock index ended in the red, while 13 ended in the green.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 10,798.35, adding 1.4% or 152.25 points, led by a rally in tech stocks.
The S&P 500 rose 0.2% or 8.07 points to close at 3,674.84. Five out of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in the green. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) rose 1.1%, 0.9% and 1.4%, respectively, while the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) plunged 5.5%.
The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) declined 5.5% to 31.13. A total of 18 billion shares were traded Friday, higher than the last 20-session average of 12.4 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.37-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, a 1.92-to-1 ratio favored the advancing issues.
Fed Commits To Bring Inflation Down To 2%
Towing the line of its three-decade-high interest rate hike of 75 basis points on Wednesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated on Friday that the central bank remains committed to bring down inflation to its target 2%, as it is essential for the global financial system. Powell mentioned that the Fed is focused on restoring the widespread confidence in the dollar as a store of value and ensuring price stability domestically. Although this sounded like a re-assurance from the apex bank to markets reeling under the pressure of inflation, this also promised further interest rate hikes.
Markets have been seeing choppy sessions as investors strive to find a balance in the Fed’s outlook toward tackling inflation with an extremely tight monetary policy, while staying away from a recession in the economy. Friday was no different, and traders closed out positions on a volatile day following his comments. The volume of shares changing hands was unusually high even as two of the three indices managed to stay in the green.
Oil Prices Edge Lower
Oil prices plunged 6% on Friday, $11 lower than the recent $125/barrel high. Brent crude fell 0.8% to $118.98/barrel, while WTI crude registered a 0.7% fall to close at $116.79. Supply is on the rise and U.S. production is at its highest since April 2020. This can trigger a rally in stocks in the coming week. Although prices fell on global economic concerns, the relation that oil prices have with commodity prices can keep the markets in good stead.

2022-06-22 00:00:00+00:00,4 Metaverse Stocks To Watch Right Now,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-metaverse-stocks-to-watch-right-now,"4 Metaverse Stocks To Check Out In The Stock Market Today
Investors unsure of what stocks to buy in the stock market today may consider investing in metaverse stocks. For those who are new to the space, the metaverse is defined as a digital, three-dimensional world that’s immersive and accessible in real-time. In particular, the metaverse allows for users to virtually interact and hang out with one another, host entertainment events, purchase virtual goods and services, and more. Although metaverse stocks have seen weakness in the past few months, that might soon be changing.
Just yesterday, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and several other major players in the industry came together to form the Metaverse Standards Forum. In brief, the consortium was formed as a means to foster the development of an industry-standard that would make the companies’ digital worlds compatible with each other. Thus, this would make it easier for developers to build across different platforms. Besides, the Metaverse Standards Forum is free to join and plans to focus on ‘pragmatic, action-based projects’ like hackathons and open source tooling. Khronos Group, a nonprofit consortium working on AR/VR, artificial intelligence, machine learning and more, will reportedly be leading the forum. Given these developments, here are four metaverse stocks to watch in the stock market today.
Metaverse Stocks To Watch Right Now
Lowe’s Companies Inc. (NYSE: LOW)
Unity Software Inc. (NYSE: U)
Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ: ADSK)
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)
Lowe’s 
Starting us off today is Lowe’s,a home improvement company. The company offers a range of products for maintenance, repair, and decorating. Consumers can also access its products and services through its websites and mobile applications. Here, customers can find online product information, customer ratings and reviews, and other vital information. The company also notes that it has 5 focus areas to drive market share acceleration. Notably, this would include accelerating its online business.
Yesterday, Lowe’s announced that it is expanding its footprint into the metaverse. Namely, it will be utilizing the metaverse’s virtual space to provide a means for builders to imagine their projects. However, unlike other retailers that chose a particular virtual platform or game, Lowe’s metaverse assets are all available for free on Lowe’s Open Builder, its newly launched asset hub. This would include free downloads of 500 of its product assets including items such as chairs and shelves.  While this is the company’s first step into the metaverse, the company has been using emerging technology to help customers gain inspiration and more easily visualize and plan their home improvement projects. Through this, Lowe’s is uniquely positioned to leverage emerging technology to help customers imagine the possibilities. As such, is LOW stock a buy?

Unity
Another notable name in the metaverse industry is Unity. For those unaware, the company provides a platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D content. On one hand, its Operate Solutions enable customers to create and monetize their content across a range of third-party content distribution platforms. On the other hand, its Create Solutions are used by content creators and designers to create interactive 2D and 3D content. Earlier this month, Unity entered into a partnership with Gala Games in a deal worth $20 million.
For those unfamiliar, Gala is a Web3 gaming and entertainment company. It is involved in publishing various games that are funded by sales from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and its own GALA token. Under the deal, Unity will be providing its professional services to work on an ambitious metaverse project with SimCity creator Will Wright. Specifically, Unity will be using its development and real-time 3D platform expertise for VOXverse, the metaverse for Gala Games’ VOX Collectible Series. As it stands, Gala Games has the support of about 1.3 million players and has 28 games in development. With this partnership in the works, should you invest in U stock?

Autodesk
Similar to Unity, Autodesk specializes in 3D design. Its products include AutoCAD Civil 3D, architecture, engineering and construction collection, Autodesk Build, Revit, Fusion 360, and many more. In addition, the company’s product development and manufacturing software provide manufacturers in the automotive, transportation, industrial machinery, and building product industries. Naturally, a company of this nature could likely be in a prime position to capitalize on a metaverse future.
Last month, the company posted its financial results for the first quarter of the year. Getting straight to it, Autodesk posted a total revenue of $1.17 billion, beating analyst estimates of $1.15 billion. Compared to the same period last year, revenue rose by 18%. As for its earnings, the company reported earnings of $1.43 per share, exceeding the $1.35 consensus estimate. In the same earnings report, Autodesk shared its outlook for the second quarter. Notably, it forecasts net revenue to be between $1.22 billion to $1.235 billion. As for profits, it expects adjusted earnings to range between $1.54 and $1.60 per share. Given the strong quarter, should you be watching ADSK stock?

Microsoft 
Last, but not least, we have Microsoft. It is a tech company that enables digital transformation for the era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge. The company’s cloud computing service includes Microsoft Azure, which supports many different programming languages, tools, and frameworks. Microsoft Office, on the other hand, is the company’s productivity tool that is used by hundreds of millions of users around the globe. MSFT stock has fallen by over 20% this year, in line with the broader market weakness. Could it be trading at an attractive valuation now?
At the company’s Build 2022 conference last month, Microsoft discussed its metaverse strategy moving ahead, which largely involves its Teams collaboration platform. Mesh for Microsoft Teams will serve as the home for the company’s workplace metaverse. Through Mesh, employees can hold immersive meetings which will allow participation via laptop, HoloLens or VR headset. Besides that, virtual brainstorming using a virtual whiteboard in the metaverse is another possible scenario. Microsoft also highlighted Mesh’s potential for all-hands meetings, workshops, and large-scale events. With the company touting the various uses of Microsoft Mesh, should you add MSFT stock to your watchlist?

2022-06-24 00:00:00+00:00,Is Nvidia the Best Stock to Buy During This Bear Market?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-nvidia-the-best-stock-to-buy-during-this-bear-market,"Among the wreckage of stocks that are significantly down from all-time highs, you'll find Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The graphics processor unit (GPU) manufacturer was previously a highly valued tech stock, but it has fallen more than 50% since last November.
Despite the price drop, Nvidia's financials and outlook were solid in the company's most recent quarter. So does this make Nvidia the best buy in this market?
Image source: Nvidia.
Nvidia's business divisions are fairly balanced
Nvidia's business can be summed up in three parts: data center, gaming, and everything else. The data center division recently passed gaming as Nvidia's largest by revenue and shows no signs of slowing down. During Nvidia's first-quarter (ending May 1) conference call, CEO and founder Jensen Huang stated: ""Our Data Center demand is strong and remains strong"" when asked if macroeconomic headwinds were affecting that segment. With more businesses harnessing cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), this segment will continue growing for years.
The gaming division can be slightly misleading. While Nvidia produces best-in-class GPUs for gaming applications, these same GPUs are also used to mine cryptocurrencies. Regardless of whether you believe in crypto, there's no denying that cryptocurrency prices have crashed in 2022. Because these GPUs can be used both for gaming and for mining, management has difficulty pinpointing what percentage of its gaming sales are attributable to miners. Without this line of sight, investors may be haphazardly walking into a trap if crypto miners quit purchasing new equipment for their mining operations.
Finally, Nvidia has two segments in what I classify as ""everything else."" First, its professional visualization platform provides customers with collaborative 3D work environments, known as the Omniverse. Second, Nvidia has an automotive category that is working on self-driving cars. Combined, these segments only made up 11% of first-quarter revenue, so they don't affect Nvidia too much in the short term.
For investors, the question remains: ""Can Nvidia's data center growth offset the potential drop due to wilting crypto mining?""
A one-time charge is affecting Nvidia's financials and valuation
During Q1, revenue grew at an impressive 46% year-over-year clip to $8.3 billion. However, the data center segment far outpaced gaming, turning in 83% year-over-year growth compared to 31% in the year-ago period. As for profitability, Nvidia doesn't break out its segments, but it reported non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) rising 49% year over year overall. Non-GAAP earnings are vital for Nvidia this quarter as the company had to take a $1.35 billion charge for terminating the Arm Holdings acquisition.
Even with the charge-off, Nvidia had more than $20 billion in cash and equivalents with $10.9 billion in debt.
For Q2, Nvidia expects revenue to be around $8.1 billion, indicating a 24% rise. Nvidia attributes this ""slow"" growth rate to Russia's actions and China's COVID-19 lockdowns. Still, this is a strong outlook considering the economic environment.
Management didn't discuss crypto risk, so investors can assume they already factored this into the overall growth. However, the real drop in crypto prices came as the calendar turned to June, meaning management could not comment on recent falling crypto demand (the call took place on May 25).
The market has assumed Nvidia will feel the effect of this slowdown, as its valuation has been slashed in the past few weeks.
NVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts.
This price-to-earnings (P/E) chart reveals a lot about Nvidia's stock. Right now, Nvidia is trading at a two-year low. Before 2020, Nvidia had massive GPU inventories caused by -- you guessed it -- cryptocurrency demand evaporating. The Nvidia now isn't the Nvidia of three years ago as it is a more balanced business, and most Nvidia GPUs are rarely in stock. This strength means Nvidia shouldn't have the inventory problem it experienced during the last crypto-drawdown cycle.
At 42 times earnings, this number is artificially high; it reflects the one-time charge-off due to the terminated Arm acquisition. Because its ""true"" earnings are higher, this increases the denominator of the valuation metric, which would drop the P/E ratio to about 37.2. This discrepancy means Nvidia's stock is cheaper than it appears, and I think investors should pounce on it.
The growth Nvidia is experiencing in data centers will remain strong until cloud deployment and AI research are complete. That could be a long way away. If the Omniverse or self-driving technology takes off, these segments could also spur massive growth. As for gaming, gamers will always demand the latest and most powerful technology to have an advantage, so that cycle will continue driving growth. While crypto mining may provide some headwinds, I don't think it's enough not to purchase the stock.
Nvidia has some difficulties, so it may not be the best stock to buy in the market. But I think it is one of the better buys in today's bear market. Investors who buy today will be thanking themselves three to five years later.

While an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.
Investor-friendly, sector ETFs provide many options to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Technology - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 8, placing it in top 50%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by State Street Global Advisors. It has amassed assets over $40 billion, making it the largest ETF attempting to match the performance of the Technology - Broad segment of the equity market.

The Technology Select Sector Index includes companies from the following industries: computers & peripherals; software; diversified telecommunication services; communications equipment; semiconductor & semiconductor equipment; internet software & services; IT services; wireless telecommunication services; electronic equipment & instruments; and office electronics.
Costs
Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.10%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.90%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc. (AAPL) accounts for about 25.09% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA).

The ETF has a beta of 1.08 and standard deviation of 29.97% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 78 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.

Because of this, XLK is a great option for investors seeking exposure to the Technology ETFs segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.

2022-06-28 00:00:00+00:00,Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Adds More Free Game Demos to Stadia,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alphabets-googl-google-adds-more-free-game-demos-to-stadia,"Alphabet’s GOOGL division Google continues to add advanced features to its game streaming platform — Stadia — and bring major game updates in order to strengthen its presence in the cloud gaming market.

This is evident from the increasing number of free game demos on Stadia. The company recently added 35 more free game demos to the library, which remains noteworthy. Previously, the number stood at 25.

This is likely to attract gamers to Stadia as they will get access to free game trials of several popular high-end games. This, in turn, is expected to bolster the subscriber base of Stadia.

Notably, the new free demos for 30 minutes support titles like Adventure Time: Pirates of the Enchiridion, Ben 10: Power Trip, Darksiders III, Ice Age: Scrat’s Nutty Adventure, PAW Patrol Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay, PAW Patrol The Movie: Adventure City Calls, PJ MASKS: HEROES OF THE NIGHT, and My Friend Peppa Pig.

Further, free demos for 60 minutes support titles such as Cake Bash, Darksiders Genesis, Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition, The Darkside Detective, The Darkside Detective: A Fumble in the Dark, and Get Packed: Fully Loaded.

Recent Initiatives
Apart from the latest addition of free game demos, Google is gearing up to boost Stadia’s graphic hardware by supporting its servers with NVIDIA GPUs.

Its introduction of a feature called the ‘Trending’ section to the Explore tab, which gives players an idea about the popular game on Stadia, is another positive.

In addition to the above-mentioned initiatives, the company’s expanding gaming library remains noteworthy. It recently added two games titled Zorro The Chronicles and Discovery Tour: Viking Age to the platform.

Stadia is set to bring the first four games in the Atari Recharged series this year, namely Centipede, Black Widow, Asteroids and Breakout.

The above-mentioned endeavors are in sync with Google’s growing efforts toward delivering an enhanced gaming experience to players.

These initiatives are expected to aid Google’s parent Alphabet in capitalizing on the immense prospects in the booming cloud gaming market.

Per an Allied Market Research report, the global cloud gaming market is expected to hit $21.9 billion by 2030, witnessing a CAGR of 57.2% between 2021 and 2030.
Competitive Scenario
However, Alphabet, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), faces stiff competition from companies like NVIDIA NVDA, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN, which are also leaving no stone unturned to bolster their presence in the promising cloud gaming market.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

NVIDIA continues to gain solid momentum in its next-generation cloud gaming platform — GeForce NOW, which offers GeForce RTX 3080-class gaming. An increasing number of blockbuster AAA titles on GeForce NOW remains noteworthy.

Further, NVIDIA added 25 games on GeForce NOW. Titles include LEAP, Souldiers, Twilight Wars: Declassified, ABRISS – build to destroy, ANNO: Mutationem, Kathy Rain: Director’s Cut, Star Conflict, MythBusters: The Game – Crazy Experiments Simulator, POSTAL: Brain Damaged, and Tour de France 2022.

Meanwhile, Microsoft’s combination of Project xCloud and Xbox Game Pass remains another major positive. Its decision to extend its cloud gaming to Xbox Series X and Series S, along with Xbox One consoles, remains noteworthy.

The extension is likely to drive Microsoft’s momentum among gamers as they can play multi-player games with just an invite and access Gen 9-only Xbox games on Xbox One.

Meanwhile, Amazon continues to gather steam from its well-performing cloud gaming service called Luna. AMZN’s focus toward expanding Luna’s compatibility with other devices, including Fire TV Sticks, Toshiba Fire TV Edition and Insignia Fire TV Edition, remains noteworthy.

Nevertheless, Google’s strengthening cloud gaming efforts are expected to continue aiding its competitive edge against the above-mentioned companies.

5 Stocks Set to Double
Each was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2021. Previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.

2022-06-29 00:00:00+00:00,2 Top Stocks That Pay You to Own Them,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-top-stocks-that-pay-you-to-own-them,"In a volatile market, worried investors can get some ease of mind when they see a monthly or quarterly payout in the form of a dividend related to the stocks they own. Whether for steady income in retirement or an easy way to dollar-cost average into a company you like, dividends should be a part of any investor's portfolio.
The two stocks we are going to discuss today, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), offer a great combination of steady returns and price growth potential, which should appeal to many investors. Considering the quality of these businesses and the fact they will pay you to own them, it might be wise to snatch up some shares. Here's why.
1. Nvidia
If you're looking for a dividend play, Nvidia is likely not the first company to spring to mind for many investors. This chipmaker's dividend yield is just 0.1%. However, what this chipmaker lacks in its dividend, it makes up for in cash generation and the opportunity it has ahead.
Nvidia is one of the leading chipmakers in several segments, but it is most known for its gaming graphics processing units (GPUs). In fact, in the discrete GPU space, Nvidia held 83% market share in Q3 2021, according to Jon Peddie Research. However, the company is also dominant in other segments as well. 71% of the top 500 supercomputers use Nvidia's chips, and its omniverse software has attracted the world's largest brands like PepsiCo and Amazon.
As a result of this leadership, Nvidia has become a major player in the chip space. In the company's fiscal 2023 first quarter (ended May 1, 2022), it generated $8.3 billion, which jumped 46% year over year. What's most exciting, however, is that Nvidia generated $9.5 billion in net income and almost $8 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months. This cash will allow it to fund its innovation to remain on top and extend into lucrative industries, and there's even enough left over to pay a small dividend.
The big risk, of course, is that this is a competitive field. Nvidia faces the likes of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. If the company's innovation falls short, it could lose market share. This hasn't happened yet, and Nvidia has continued to update and create exciting products, but it's something to be aware of.
If Nvidia can remain at the top, it could capitalize on some lucrative industries going forward. It has its foot in the door in plenty of tech segments, and when you combine them, Nvidia sees a $1 trillion opportunity ahead of it.
It makes sense then that Nvidia wants to funnel most of its available cash into funding growth on those fronts. But that won't always be the case and eventually the profits will make their way more directly into shareholders' investment accounts. Till then, Nvidia is willing to pay you to wait patiently for it to gain prevalence in emerging industries, and you might want to take advantage of that.
2. Starbucks
Starbucks might not have a $1 trillion addressable market opportunity ahead of it, but it does have a leading brand reputation in the coffee space, long-term adoption, and a dividend yield of almost 2.5%.
Starbucks was known for being ""the third place"" consumers go after home and work, but when COVID-19 hit, it shifted gears. It now focuses heavily on its digital app, which has been the right move. In its fiscal 2022 second quarter (ended April 3), the company had 26.7 million active rewards members in the U.S., a 17% year-over-year jump.
While Starbucks might no longer be a hyper-growth company, its still a growing company with steady financial performance. Since the company came public in 1992, it has increased its earnings per share by over 266,000%. Since 2010, it has been paying out a consistent and growing dividend every quarter.
One opportunity that could help Starbucks keep building on its success is China. COVID-19-related lockdowns in China over the past two years have slowed its growth potential in that market, but it's still growing. Just in Q2 the company opened 97 stores there. If COVID-19 restrictions fully ease, Starbucks could see a strong recovery in the region.
Starbucks is one of the strongest brands in the U.S., with more than 15,500 stores. The company has seen steady adoption of its mobile app and continues to gain traction in China, despite the turmoil in the region. While this company might not knock the doors off its top-line expansion over the coming decade, it could continue providing steady returns and potentially beat the market if it can keep chugging along. Additionally, it is paying you to hold it, which looks like a deal too good to walk away from.

  Welcome back to Mind Over Money. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and storyteller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics.

In a recent episode, I featured a gentleman who has designed what I believe is the ultimate personal finance software. It's better than anything I've ever seen.

That episode which came out on May 12 was titled Get Your Money Game In Top Shape With Mark Harvey, The MoneyPlan Coach.

What I loved about Mark Harvey's approach was the comprehensive nature of the platform for all areas of your financial life. And all the calculations were well connected so you could create scenarios for anything you wanted to see.

Mark is also big on getting the message to people when they are young and impressionable -- but also flexible in their habits -- with financial education and tools like this.

Be sure to catch that episode if you haven't yet because it's packed with good perspective from a guy who was cutting his teeth in the mortgage market over 30 years ago and he's now an RIA and has the highest fiduciary role with the IRS to serve his clients, that of the Enrolled Agent.

Meet the College Investor

As I was helping Mark look for other podcasts to visit and spread the word, I came across another gem of a teacher, Robert Farrington of The College Investor. The website is a dynamic hub of information, resources, methodologies, and platform, institution, and technology reviews for new investors. Here's the quick overview...

The College Investor is on a mission to help you escape student loan debt so that you can start building real wealth for the future.

They help you navigate your personal finance decisions - so you can escape debt, earn more money, learn how to start investing, and more.

The College Investor has been providing expert guides, reviews, tutorials, and more for their readers since September 2009. What started out as a personal finance blog by founder Robert Farrington has evolved into a financial media brand reaching millions of readers per month - across their website, podcast, and video channels.

In the podcast, I talk with the very enthusiastic founder Robert Farrington, America’s Millennial Money Expert® and America's Student Loan Debt Expert.™

After talking a little about Robert's early experiences with money, debt, and investing, I dive right into asking him about three benchmark articles for his wide audience, including the up-and-coming Gen Z...

How To Get Started Investing In College
How To Get Started Investing In Your 20s
How To Get Started Investing In Your 30s

What impresses me about Robert's approach to early investing education is that it basically ""flips the script"" for a college grad from ""saddled with debt"" to a mentality of ""proactively crushing debt and building lifetime wealth.""

That headstart at 20 vs 30 is powerful!

And what I also love about getting to high school and college kids is that if you can teach them to budget for saving and investing, you've taught them one of the most powerful skill-habits that will serve them tremendously in their prime earning and spending years.

One question I forgot to ask Robert was this: I've started to see a mini-revolt online (YouTube influencers) toward the 401k as if it is some type of giant scam. If you as a reader or listener have a view here, please share in the comments, or when you share the podcast and article on social media.

The $100 Billion Cult Doubles

In 2018, I talked about ""The $100 Billion Cult: Video Gaming and Youth Culture"" and now that market is going to cross $200 billion this year. Microsoft thinks it's such a big part of what I call the ""ET Squared Economy"" (Exponential Technology X Experience + Transformation) that they were willing to bet $68.7 billion to swallow up Activision Blizzard.

Millennials and Gen Z are working, earning, creating, and spending in this new ET Squared Economy that allows them to individually build wealth as they partake in massive global wealth generation.

Last week, my guest was Zechariah Schaefer of the Advice-Only firm Ascent Personal Finance where he focuses on helping Gen Z and Millennial investors with financial planning. Catch that episode for more insight on what drives the youth fascination for games, tech, crypto, and the new rules of a new economy.

And if I had to recommend five stocks for those 45 and under right now, I'd go with NVIDIA NVDA, Apple, Shopify SHOP, Block, and CrowdStrike CRWD. Maybe I'd throw in MongoDB too as a robust and innovative database technology platform that offers a new ecosystem outside Google and AWS for developers.

Why NVIDIA? The #1 provider of advanced technology for machine learning/AI, gaming/creating, medical diagnostics, and automation/robotics capabilities.

Why Apple AAPL? The juggernaut will continue to dominate in devices and software, even for what comes next in augmented reality (AR) after the iPhone.

Why Shopify? As Robert Farrington recommends, all young investors should be building multiple streams of income, and Shopify will be a magnet for learning the ropes of e-commerce.

Why Block SQ? The premier ecosystem for small business is dedicated to serving all kinds of independent creators and staying in tune with the Blockchain economy.

Why CrowdStrike? A top cybersecurity platform specializing in endpoint threats at the edge of the cloud. This is vital in a world of IoT, 100 billiion connected devices, and remote work.

College Investor Audio Show

Finally, I want to highlight the genius of Robert Farrington with his alternative podcast mode. Instead of long, rambling interviews (I feel seen), he publishes short episodes of the College Investor Audio Show every week that highlight new research, reviews, or recap an existing article.

Sounds like I could learn a few things from Robert and his team.

Be sure to listen to our ""shorter"" chat and get the goods from a mission-driven investor who's been working over a decade to help Millennials (and now their kids) sketch their roadmap and get the vehicles for a life of wealth building.

2022-07-01 00:00:00+00:00,Is First Trust NASDAQ100Technology Sector ETF (QTEC) a Strong ETF Right Now?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-first-trust-nasdaq100technology-sector-etf-qtec-a-strong-etf-right-now-1,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Technology ETFs category of the market, the First Trust NASDAQ100Technology Sector ETF (QTEC) is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 04/19/2006.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.
Market cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.
The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.
Fund Sponsor & Index
The fund is managed by First Trust Advisors, and has been able to amass over $1.61 billion, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Technology ETFs. QTEC, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector Index.
The NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector Index is an equal-weighted index based on the securities of the NASDAQ-100 Index that are classified as technology.
Cost & Other Expenses
When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.
With on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.56%.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.04%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 91.60% of the portfolio.
When you look at individual holdings, Splunk Inc. (SPLK) accounts for about 2.57% of the fund's total assets, followed by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA).
Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 24.85% of QTEC's total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
So far this year, QTEC has lost about -34.63%, and is down about -28.03% in the last one year (as of 07/01/2022). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $110.94 and $180.39.
The fund has a beta of 1.14 and standard deviation of 33.33% for the trailing three-year period, which makes QTEC a high risk choice in this particular space. With about 43 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.
Alternatives
First Trust NASDAQ100Technology Sector ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Technology ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.
Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) tracks Technology Select Sector Index and the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) tracks MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index. Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF has $37.90 billion in assets, Vanguard Information Technology ETF has $40.03 billion. XLK has an expense ratio of 0.10% and VGT charges 0.10%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Technology ETFs.
Bottom Line

2022-07-05 00:00:00+00:00,1 Big Reason to Buy Nvidia Stock on the Dip,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-big-reason-to-buy-nvidia-stock-on-the-dip,"The stock market sell-off has been brutal and indiscriminate this year, with almost no industry spared the pain. But the technology sector is being particularly hard hit after being one of the best places to invest throughout the pandemic.
That means, in some cases, there are high-quality opportunities available at a discount. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is one of the top semiconductor companies in the world, and it's rapidly evolving into a leading platform computing powerhouse thanks to its investments in advanced software tools.
Its stock price has fallen 58% from its all-time high, and while there are several reasons to own it, here's one that is sometimes overlooked.
Driving autonomous vehicles
Nvidia is best known for its world-leading graphics chips, which are used most commonly in gaming and data center applications. These two segments accounted for 88% of the company's revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended May 1).
But Nvidia's smallest segment -- automotive and robotics -- is arguably the most exciting. It's a tiny piece of the company's overall business, making up just 1.8% of its total revenue over the last 12 months, but that has real potential to change.
The segment is led by the Nvidia DRIVE platform, which is an end-to-end solution for car manufacturers who want to build autonomous (self-driving) vehicles. Not only does Nvidia provide the hardware, but it also delivers the software, which includes highly advanced technologies like artificial intelligence to help train autonomous models.
Nvidia DRIVE Sim leverages the company's Omniverse platform, a 3D rendering tool that allows developers to create accurate real-life scenarios in a virtual environment to produce physically accurate simulations. Omniverse is used by some of the world's largest companies to create digital twins of their physical assets with accuracy to the millimeter, so it's the perfect platform with which to map roads for self-driving applications.
It's an explosive financial opportunity
While Nvidia's automotive and robotics segment has generated only $550 million in revenue over the last 12 months, it has a sales pipeline of $11 billion. This is expected to convert to revenue over the next six years, but the ramp-up could be swift once manufacturers begin rolling out the technology.
Mercedes-Benz (OTC: DMLR.Y) will be among the first automakers to sell autonomous vehicles built using Nvidia DRIVE. It expects to begin deliveries in 2024, and it's one of 35 brands adopting the platform. Others include electric vehicle companies Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) and Nio (NYSE: NIO) in addition to Tata Motors' (NYSE: TTM) Jaguar and Land Rover.
Between now and 2030, the market for autonomous vehicles is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 40%, which takes Nvidia's opportunity to over $2.1 trillion annually by that time. Therefore, despite the automotive segment being Nvidia's smallest right now, that could change very quickly in the next few years.
But investors don't have to wait to buy Nvidia stock, because analysts expect the company will deliver $33.7 billion in total revenue during fiscal 2023 on the back of its leading gaming and data center segments. Nvidia is a fast-growing, highly profitable opportunity, and once its automotive segment ramps up further, it could deliver significant rewards to patient investors who stuck with it.

2022-07-06 00:00:00+00:00,Should You Invest in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT)?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-invest-in-the-vanguard-information-technology-etf-vgt-1,"Launched on 01/26/2004, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Technology - Broad segment of the equity market.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Sector ETFs also provide investors access to a broad group of companies in particular sectors that offer low risk and diversified exposure. Technology - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 12, placing it in bottom 25%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $40.76 billion, making it the largest ETF attempting to match the performance of the Technology - Broad segment of the equity market. VGT seeks to match the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index before fees and expenses.
The MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index is designed to transition in and out of securities affected by pending updates to the information technology sector.
Costs
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.10%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.90%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector--about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc. (AAPL) accounts for about 22.98% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA).
Performance and Risk
The ETF has lost about -27.75% so far this year and is down about -16.89% in the last one year (as of 07/06/2022). In that past 52-week period, it has traded between $315.97 and $466.10.

2022-07-07 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia and AMD Jumped Today,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-and-amd-jumped-today,"What happened
Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) popped on Thursday after Samsung Electronics provided earnings guidance that was better than many investors expected.
As of 3:10 p.m. ET, the chipmakers' stock prices were up 4.9% and 5.6%, respectively.
So what
The prices of many chip stocks are down sharply in 2022. Supply chain shortages have slowed chip production schedules, while rising costs have dented chipmakers' profit margins.
Nvidia's and AMD's stock prices haven't been spared from the carnage. The semiconductor leaders' shares are both down more than 40% so far this year.
NVDA data by YCharts
Yet Samsung's guidance gave tech investors hope that some of the industry's challenges might be abating. The South Korean chip titan said it expects its revenue to grow by roughly 21% year over year to 77 trillion Korean won ($59 billion) in the second quarter. The company also projected that its operating profits would increase by about 11% to 14 trillion Korean won ($11 billion). Those figures were better than several analysts predicted.
Now what
The news also suggests that demand for chips may be stronger than many investors thought. After rising sharply during the early stages of the pandemic, sales of laptops and smartphones are widely expected to slow. But sales of chips used in data centers are projected to remain robust as more companies shift their operations to the cloud. These cloud-related sales should help to support Nvidia's and AMD's growth.
Additionally, Samsung's upbeat guidance could indicate that supply chain constraints are easing. That would allow chipmakers to produce more of their products that remain in high demand.

Among the most beat-up semiconductor stocks, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is the most disliked one. INTC stock trades at a price-to-earnings and a price-to-sales multiple that value investors will think are too good. By comparison, Intel’s peers, which include Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), are relatively more expensive.
Intel trades at a multi-year discount for a good reason. Since AMD rebuilt its desktop processor architecture, Intel lost its way. After each successive release from AMD, Intel failed to catch up. Late last year, Intel launched the Alder Lake CPU. This platform supports DDR5, a faster memory architecture. It also supports faster PCIe lanes, giving consumers better performance.
Nasdaq’s steep correction scared Intel investors. At these valuations, Intel could rise sharply from here.
Ticker Company Price
INTC Intel Corporation $38.14
Huge Positive Catalyst
Originally set for an early 2021 release, Intel delayed the launch of Arc. The company needed a custom graphics card architecture to widen its addressable market. This schedule miss sparked aggressive stock selling.
7 Best Bargain Stocks to Buy in July 2022
On Jun. 19, Intel officially listed Arc A380 in China for $595, or 3,999 RMB. Intel Arc will have to overclock at speeds of up to 2,450 MHz. The TDP, or energy needed to run the GPU, is only 92 watts.
Intel is playing it safe with this soft launch. China is not a big GPU market for Intel. Instead of taking a risk with a North American launch, it will fine-tune its marketing and pricing in China. More importantly, the chip giant will get feedback from critical customers. It will work out bugs, if any, in the device driver software.
Intel could quickly grow its market share in the U.S. in the coming year. With positive reviews, highly satisfied customers will market Intel Arc on the company’s behalf.
Production Capacity Growth Delay
To hedge against the risk of China invading Taiwan, Intel is smartly widening its manufacturing geography. It planned to build a large chip factory outside of Columbus, Ohio.
Intel said that delays in passing the CHIPS Act would also delay Intel’s factory building plans. In January, Intel said it would spend up to $100 billion to build the plant. It committed to a starting investment of $20 billion.
Intel must get funding approved by Congress. It cannot move forward with its project plan without taking more risks. For example, supply chain disruptions are directly increasing inflation rates. Consumers have lower disposable income, hurting computer chip demand. The Central Bank raised rates to fight inflation, which could lead to a recession. This hurts the sales of PCs. Intel cannot increase demand risks without government support that lowers its costs.
Why INTC Stock Is a Buy
Intel has a superior PC chip architecture. For now, Intel may leverage its advancements by selling as many units of Alder Lake as possible before the downturn.
To broaden its product portfolio, Intel Arc opens up a new market. Intel has the budget to advertise and promote an alternative to Nvidia and AMD graphics cards.
The GPU market still enjoys strong pricing power. Intel needs to capture the market while gamers continue to spend on their upgrades.

2022-07-11 00:00:00+00:00,New Metaverse Angle Should Spur Investor Interest in Nvidia,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/new-metaverse-angle-should-spur-investor-interest-in-nvidia,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
There’s been a lot going on with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) lately. First, the company is collaborating with Siemens (OTCMKTS:SIEGY) to develop real-world uses for the metaverse. Second, Nvidia’s components are helping to enable artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled voice and vision applications. On top of all that, a Wall Street expert recently issued an ambitious price target for NVDA stock.
Nvidia never ceases to push the envelope when it comes to next-generation hardware development. You probably know the company as a graphics-card pioneer, yet Nvidia isn’t afraid to branch out into other areas.
Indeed, you just never know whom Nvidia might collaborate with next in the pursuit of tech-market domination. In this context, as Nvidia’s competitive moat gets wider, the bull case for the company’s investors only gets stronger.
NVDA Nvidia $151.52
What’s Happening with NVDA Stock?
NVDA stock is down in 2022 so far, but that could be said about many technology stocks. When the tide is sinking, most boats will go down and that’s just how it is on Wall Street. It’s not necessarily Nvidia’s fault, and any current share-price weakness can be viewed as a prime buying opportunity.
7 Best Biotech Stocks to Buy in July 2022
Even with the Nvidia share price under pressure, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh seems undeterred from his optimistic outlook. Observing steady cloud-market growth in May driven by computing processors, Vinh maintained his “overweight” rating on Nvidia (which is similar to a “buy” rating).
Along with that, the KeyBanc analyst issued an ambitious $250 price target on NVDA stock. It wasn’t long ago that the stock traded near $160. Could there really be that much upside potential? The answer depends on Nvidia’s drive to stay ahead of its competitors in advancing new concepts and products — and we can definitely count on Nvidia in that regard.
A New Frontier in the Metaverse
Just recently, two examples of Nvidia’s drive to innovate came to the fore. The first is a blog post describing Sensory’s use of hybrid computing, which uses both cloud-based and on-premises computing resources. Hybrid computing helps Sensory bring interactivity to many types of voice-enabled electronics, from wearables to refrigerators and microwave ovens.
Of course, this couldn’t be accomplished without the right hardware, and Nvidia is glad to provide it. To that end, some of Sensory’s recently introduced AI-embedded voice and vision applications “rely on NVIDIA NeMo — a toolkit to build state-of-the-art conversational AI models — and Triton Inference Server for its Sensory Cloud hybrid computing unit.”
Meanwhile, Nvidia has a powerful partner in Siemens as the two companies seek to build out a particular, real-life area of the metaverse. We can call it the industrial metaverse, where physics-based digital twins can help engineering teams tackle tough manufacturing-industry problems.
According to the press release, the two companies “plan to connect Siemens Xcelerator, the open digital business platform, and NVIDIA Omniverse… a platform for 3D design and collaboration.” This way, Nvidia can combine its real-time AI with Siemens’ physics-based digital models, and thereby combine the best of both worlds – physical and digital.
What You Can Do Now
Clearly, the industrial metaverse is still in the early stages. It’s exciting to consider how Nvidia and Siemens will develop this AI-enhanced tech frontier.
Nvidia is also providing its components to help advance voice and vision applications with multiple potential uses in business and at home. As you can see, Nvidia is relentless in its quest to push the boundaries of what’s possible with technology.
With this in mind, it’s not hard to justify a $250 price target – and a long position, if you’d like to take one — with NVDA stock.

2022-07-12 00:00:00+00:00,7 Cheap Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-cheap-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-now-0,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It is hard to believe that there would enough cheap semiconductor stocks to buy to build a list like this. But today that is what we will be doing, in an effort to start building a position for the future.
The semiconductor sector has had better years than 2022 so far. But in all fairness, the whole stock market has struggled since middle of last year. In spite of still-high pessimism levels, I expect improvement in the second half. The bulls have a legitimate shot at taking some control this coming quarter.
And if that assumption is right, these are cheap semiconductor stocks to buy now to capitalize on that recovery.
If the stock market stabilizes, the upside potential in semis will be near the top. Consider this a thoughtful but not exclusive list of options. Also, it is better to leg into full positions in small pieces, since the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is still about 40% above average.
These cheap semiconductor stocks slid fast and hard from their 2021 heydays. This was a direct byproduct of over-exuberance on the way up. Wall Street often overcommits in either direction, thereby creating these extreme situations. But as long as markets are not ready to take another significant leg lower, there should be opportunities among great cheap semiconductor stocks.
Investors need to be moderate with their approach this year. And none of the major semiconductor companies have problems specific to them. They are all suffering from similar extrinsic ailments — mainly the global shortages. But this summer, the shrinkage in demand that central banks are attempting could help.
5 Best Stocks to Buy if You Have $100 to Spend
Now, let’s look at the top cheap semiconductor stocks.
SMH VanEck Semiconductor ETF $203.64
NVDA Nvidia $151.52
AMD Advanced Micro Devices $76.95
INTC Intel $37.20
TSM Taiwan Semiconductor $79.11
AVGO Broadcom $482.86
LRCX Lam Research $402.41
VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)

I am opening the list with VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), which is a trade on the whole semiconductor sector. This is a liquid ETF that represents a blend of all the cheap semiconductor stocks. The SMH ETF is down 34% on the year.
Since its top holdings are a who’s-who in high-tech semiconductors, few can argue against its fundamental qualities. If the equity markets are higher in the future, then the SMH stock is also a winner. I could have even picked a few more companies from its portfolio today, like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) for example.
Short term, there are technical challenges from resistance zones above. On the way down, the selling was heavy near $221 and $237 per share. There’s a bit a room before we get there, but there are likely to be sellers lurking there. Such battles are opportunities for the bulls to exhaust the bears. They might stall at first, but with rise above after subsequent pushes.
That’s a necessary process to build a better, more moderate base below. These comments are also true for almost the rest of all cheap semiconductor stocks on our list today.
Nvidia (NVDA)

The next two cheap semiconductor stocks to buy can be interchangeable. They are both momentum stocks and down heavily this year.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has suffered some of the blows that Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has taken this year. As the crypto has corrected 70%, so has interest in Bitcoin mining. NVDA stock benefits on the way up from from that mining theme, but it suffers from its drop too.
Therefore it is important to recognize that there is still extra downside potential from that. While Bitcoin showed strength last week, it’s not out of the woods yet. There is a technical scenario that could suggest another 30% to 40% lower from here. I don’t think that’s likely, but be cautious.
But even then, I don’t believe NVDA stock would follow it down that much.
7 Best Biotech Stocks to Buy in July 2022
The company has done a great job growing, so its fans will defend when it is already this lean. Year-to-date, NVDA is down almost 50% already. The easy damage has already happened, and the bears will need to work much harder to inflict more pain. Without an extraneous headwind, Nvidia stock will stabilize.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Source: Joseph GTK / Shutterstock.com
As mentioned, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock is almost interchangeable with NVDA for today’s purpose. They both catch a heavy influence from the trade in Bitcoin. Also, they like to hog the headlines. That is why both stocks are down about the same, nearly 50%, so far this year.
AMD also has excellent fundamentals under its leadership team. CEO Lisa Su focused the efforts, and now they sport a strong set of financials. The metrics are as impressive on growth, yet lean on the value side. For that reason I prefer AMD to NVDA, because it has less potential bloat.
Under calmer conditions, the positive narrative should win out. Cheap semiconductor stocks will rise if the markets are not struggling.
Technically, AMD stock could struggle near and going into $88 per share. The sellers will try to stifle the progress these. So the general markets will need to stabilize to help AMD’s cause.
Intel (INTC)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is likely my best example of erroneous extremism. It is the cheapest of the cheap semiconductor stocks to buy, and the way Wall Street treats it is the picture-perfect example of disrespect.
It currently has a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 6.3. That’s practically an insult. But for now, the market is not giving it nearly as much respect as it deserves.
This stock suits investors with patience and an appreciation for solid businesses. It has earned better respect than this, but that attention will eventually return. Also INTC stock is not as sensitive to the price of Bitcoin.
7 Best Bear Market Stocks to Buy in July 2022
The only muscle Intel stock really needs to flex is its financial report card. In 2021, it generated almost $80 billion in sales and flowed roughly $20 billion to the net income line. What it lacks in pizazz it makes it up in consistent success. The investment community will fall back in love with it sooner or later, so accumulating some while it’s this cheap make good sense.
Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is an old company that has survived many decades of adverse situations. What is going on now is not likely to kill it. So as long as the indices continue to base, TSM stock will be just fine.
But management will report earnings soon. These events tend to offer a potential of short-term drama from human emotions. The expectations build up so high that they can lead to exaggerated rallies and drops in knee-jerk reactions to earnings headlines. These are temporary, so I’d caution against chasing the initial pop or drop.
Management’s scorecards are as solid as they come. They generate more than $60 billion in revenues and $22 billion in net income. It is hard to argue against this, especially when they have continuously grown the metrics. If the global economies are not going into a long depression, there is legitimate opportunity from here.
In the meantime, I would just be careful around earnings.
Broadcom (AVGO)
Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock bounced well off its 2021 base. This is encouraging, showing that its fans are not too eager to dip into the 2020 ranges. The bad news is that this fact leaves it a bit vulnerable from a low-odds scenario. If the markets suffer another significant drop from here, AVGO stock would have a lot further to fall than normal. The base near $420 per share is strong, but would flip to be a bearish catalyst under heavy selling.
The AVGO technical advantage could extend another 9% before hitting a serious resistance zone.
Then there is the help that its dividend brings. Even though rates are rising, it’s nice to have a stock this strong that can also reward its owners with a 3.4% bonus dividend payout.
7 Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in July 2022
The trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 24.7 is not screaming cheap, but it is not a detriment either. As long as they continue to execute on plans, the buyers will come to it.
Lam Research (LRCX)
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock
The last of my cheap semiconductor stocks to buy is Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX). This one doesn’t make too many headlines, but its financials tell the right story. Lam management grew sales 70% in three years. That’s a thriving business riding a fast wave. The digitization trend is also ongoing and it’s not likely to easy up soon.
The sign of a strong team is growth without bloat. So far, they are doing the first part while delivering $4 billion in cash from operations. There aren’t many problems to threaten LRCX investors’ long term perspective.
But for now, it will face selling resistance this month. This will change in a few weeks, when the buyers have the opportunity to build a positive trend. Then the short-term dips become reasons to buy LRCX stock.

July 13 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Cloud unit on Wednesday said it will start adopting computing chips based on technology from Arm Ltd, making it the latest company to join a transition that will take market share from Intel Corp INTC.O and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O.
Arm, the British chip firm that has said it plans to go public after a megadeal to be acquired by Nvidia Corp NVDA.O fell through earlier this year, has long supplied designs and other intellectual property that power chips for smart phones and tablets. In 2018, Arm started offering technology for chips used in data centers, a market dominated by Intel and AMD.
In the four years since, Arm's technology, which it licenses to other companies to weave into complete chips, has showed up in data centers around the world, including those at Amazon.com AMZN.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Oracle Corp ORCL.N in the United States and Alibaba 9988.HK, Baidu 9888.HK and Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700.HK in China.
Those firms buy huge volumes of computing chips and then rent out the computing power to software developers via their paid cloud computing services. They all still offer services based on chips from Intel and AMD. But with Google joining the ranks of cloud providers offering Arm-based chips, nearly every major provider now has at least a few offerings based on Arm.
Some of the cloud computing firms such as Amazon and Alibaba are designing their own Arm-based chips and having them manufactured by chip factories. Several others - including Google - are turning to Ampere Computing, a chip firm founded by former Intel executives that has filed confidential paperwork with U.S. securities regulators for an initial public offering.
Google said on Wednesday its new offering will be based on Ampere's ""Altra"" chips. Ampere is also selling chips to Microsoft and Oracle, among others.

The CHIPS for America Act, meant to bring the semiconductor industry back to America, has become lost in partisan politics. Republican leaders who claim to support it are using it to seek concessions on other issues. Anyone interested in semiconductor stocks should pay close attention to these developments.
Stock in companies that support the funding are hitting the ground and aren’t being picked up. Reports that the present chip shortage is easing has increased opposition. Many oppose subsidizing an industry that appears, on the surface, to be highly profitable.
While I have many friends who question the need for the act, making semiconductors is a dirty business done by highly-paid people. Low-wage countries with lax environmental protections captured it decades before the origin of chips became a national security concern.
If we want to allay the national security concern, or avoid the industry moving to Europe, taxpayers must make an investment that will pay off in jobs, taxes and repaired supply chains.
There’s less urgency among voters for the semiconductor industry. The pressure to pass the bill is all coming from the industry, which is delaying construction of new facilities until the funding is secure.

If you think the CHIPS Act is necessary and likely to pass eventually, now would be a good time to buy the companies that most benefit from it.

Intel (INTC)

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) isn’t exactly broke right now, but the economics of the industry mean its cash would be better deployed in Vietnam or Abu Dhabi if the U.S. government doesn’t help.
CEO Pat Gelsinger, a longtime Intel executive who returned from VMWare (NYSE:VMW) last year, saw Intel move offshore and wants to bring it back. But he has threatened to move production to Europe if he doesn’t get government cash.
Intel is desperate because it needs to make decisions now on where it will produce chips in 2025. By then it hopes to be making chips with circuit lines just 18 Angstroms, less than two nanometers apart.
While Moore’s Law gets the headlines, Intel is acting as it is thanks to Moore’s Second Law. That is, as circuit lines get closer the equipment to make them becomes proportionally more expensive. There’s also what I call Moore’s Third Law, the idea that as chips grow more complex their environmental footprint also grows.
In the past, Intel offset these costs by putting factories where labor cost less, or environmental regulations were ignored. For Intel, the CHIPS for America Act is necessary to offset those costs. Without it, Gelsinger argues, Intel is either overseas or uncompetitive.
Nvidia (NVDA)

No company better represents the recent past of the semiconductor industry, and its future, than Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Nvidia makes graphics processors. These were once thought of as “helper” chips that offloaded complex graphics calculations from the microprocessor, for things like rendering video games. They’re now at the heart of artificial intelligence and metaverse applications, the future of the industry.
Nvidia doesn’t manufacture chips. It designs them, then hires a fabrication plant or foundry to make them. In recent years that has been Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), first to master the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology needed to render designs at 10 nm and less.
Nvidia’s co-founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, was also born in Taiwan, in the historical capital of Tainan, six years before Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO Lisa Su was born in the same city.

This brings up the industry’s problem. China claims Taiwan as its territory, and regularly threatens to take it by force. The semiconductor industry is now completely dependent on Taiwan for leadership as well as for manufacturing. If Taiwan were invaded today, the entire world economy would be threatened.

An hour’s drive outside Taipei is Hsinchu Technology Park, the most important manufacturing center in the world.
This is where Taiwan Semiconductor has most of its fabrication plants, or “fabs.” This is where it mastered EUV process needed for making today’s most powerful microprocessors.
Taiwan Semi has mastered this technology. Samsung has, too. Intel says it has. Chinese semiconductor manufacturers have not. China finds making even 14 nm chips difficult without imported technology, which the U.S. is now trying to deny it.
Taiwan Semiconductor is now building plants in Arizona and promises to build more once the CHIPS for America Act passes. This would protect the global industry from China’s threats against Taiwan Semiconductor’s home, a possible landing point for Chinese troops in an invasion. If war came, analysts at the U.S. Army War College have suggested, the Taiwanese plants should be destroyed. This would take the global economy with it.
Meanwhile, two thirds of the world’s semiconductor foundry revenue goes to Taiwan.
Micron (MU)

Micron (NASDAQ:MU) makes something the rest of the U.S. industry, including Intel, have given up on.
Micron makes memory and storage chips. Two Korean companies dominate the memory market, but Micron still has a 23% share.
Micron is known for making chips at its hometown of Boise, Idaho, but it is a global supplier, with plants in Malaysia, Taiwan and even China. Micron plans to invest $150 billion over the next decade. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra says that, depending on the fate of the act, more or less of that money will go to the U.S.
7 Best Biotech Stocks to Buy in July 2022
Because memory chips are commodities, unlike microprocessors, their price and Micron’s profitability are very sensitive to supply and demand. This has made the stock highly volatile over many years. It traded for just $10 as recently as 2016, and for $97 as recently as January. It’s down 37% on the year as prices for memory have eased for the first time in years.
Apple (AAPL)
Source: Moab Republic / Shutterstock
The biggest beneficiary of the CHIPS for America Act is America’s most valuable company, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Apple has been seeking to control its supply chain for years. At the center of this are semiconductors, which it designs based on ARM Holdings designs. But Apple has no chip foundries of its own. Instead, it depends heavily on Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor.
As Taiwan Semiconductor expands in the U.S., in other words, Apple secures its own supply chain. Apple chips are among those expected to be produced at Taiwan Semiconductor’s new Arizona plant.
Apple CEO Tim Cook has said supply constraints could cost Apple as much as $8 billion this quarter. That is one reason why Apple stock is down 18% so far in 2022. Apple’s new designs change the entire industry landscape and will let it unify its iPad, iPhone and Mac product lines.
But without new manufacturing capacity in the U.S., it may all be just vaporware.

2022-07-15 00:00:00+00:00,Should You Buy GOOG on Monday After Its Big Split?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-goog-on-monday-after-its-big-split,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
We’ve talked about how some great stocks are on sale right now.
Here’s one for you: What if a stock went from $2,260 per share to $113… in one day… and nothing about this dominant business changed?
You will see that Monday morning with shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).
But don’t get too excited. In this case, $113 = $2,260.
That’s impossible, of course. So what’s going on?
GOOG shares are splitting 20:1. After Friday’s close, every single GOOG share gets divided into 20 shares. There will now be 20X more shares on the market, but the price per share be 1/20th of what it used to be.
This is not some once-in-a-lifetime bargain to jump on.
However, interesting things can and do happen around stock splits. So in today’s Market360, let’s look at whether this particular split is a buying opportunity.
Why Would GOOG Split?
This is the second time in six weeks that a $2,000 stock has split 20-to-1.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) closed at $2,447 on Friday, June 3. On Monday, June 6, it opened $125.25 after the split. Perhaps not coincidentally, the stock hit its highest price that day since the end of April. As of this writing, it is down about 10% since then.
If it feels like you’ve been hearing a lot about stock splits, that’s not because the number of splits has gone up. It’s because big and well-known stocks are doing the splitting.
In the last two years, Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have all split. Tesla has another one in the works — a proposed 3-for-1 split shareholders will vote on at the company’s annual meeting Aug. 4. And one of the crazy meme stocks, GameStop (NYSE:GME), will split 4-for-1 next Friday, July 22.
The main reason companies split is to make their shares cheaper. In Alphabet’s case, the 20-to-1 split is an instant 95% price cut. That makes the stock more affordable, especially to individual investors.
Honestly, now that investors can buy fractional shares, splitting changes things less than it used to. Still, the companies want to make their stock as accessible as possible to retail investors, and a lower price is the best way to do that.
Is the Split an Opportunity?
Stock splits do tend to attract investors. I closely monitor buying pressure in stocks as it is a sizable chunk of my quantitative analysis, so I do follow splits closely.
Stocks also usually get at least a minor bump. Over the last five years, stocks that split are up one year later 61% of the time, according to the folks at Bespoke. But the bottom line is less encouraging. Stocks that split outperformed the market less than half the time.
A split by itself is not an automatic buy signal. It is a minor factor when compared to a company’s fundamentals.
I have followed Alphabet for a long time. I still think of it as Google, even though it has been almost seven years since the name changed. As you may have seen, MarketWatch has called me “the advisor who recommended Google before anyone else.”
I still like it all of these years later. It is one of the biggest business success stories of our time.
But that doesn’t mean I view the stock as a buy all of the time. In fact, right now I would consider it more of a hold.
While I think the split could bring in new investors — in fact, I think it could pop 8% on Monday — the biggest problem right now is earnings momentum. Earnings are expected to shrink nearly 3% in the current quarter and about 1% for the fiscal year. Alphabet fell short of expectations last quarter by 3.6%, which isn’t a huge miss, but any miss for the company has been rare in recent years.
So, should you run out and snap up shares of GOOG after the split?
Well, according to my Portfolio Grader, the answer is no — though that doesn’t mean it’s a sell either.
As you can see in the Report Card above, GOOG has been a “Hold” in my Portfolio Grader for about three months now. It holds a C-rating for its Fundamental Grade, which is not bad but reflective of the current earnings situation. Its Quantitative Rating is a bit higher at B, and that may hold up after the split if buying pressure builds.
My recommendation is to hang on to GOOG if you own it, but I would be hesitant to buy it now if you don’t. Alphabet is a great company in the midst of an earnings lull, not unlike a lot of other companies. When that tide starts to run, I would expect it to again be a buy at its post-split share price.
P.S. If you are looking for a stock to buy right now, I encourage you to check out my latest presentation with the investor known as “The Prophet” — Whitney Tilson.

2022-07-20 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Rallied Another 3% Today,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-rallied-another-3-today,"What happened
Shares of top semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were rallying 3.4% today as of 2 p.m. ET. There was no specific financial news causing this, but Nvidia is making a comeback along with other growth stocks after being hit hard during the first half of 2022. Nvidia is up over 16% in the last five trading days alone, though it remains off 54% from all-time highs.
So what
There was some non-financial news impacting Nvidia in the last week. The U.S. Senate is getting ready to vote on the Chips Act, some $52 billion in subsidies aimed at bolstering the American semiconductor industry. To be clear, this funding -- if passed -- won't directly help Nvidia. The Chips Act is geared toward chip manufacturing, providing money to build and upgrade chip fabs in the U.S. to increase domestic production. Nvidia designs chips, it doesn't manufacture them.
However, given the global chip shortage the last two years, fabless chip companies like Nvidia that tap chipmaker partners to fulfill customer orders could still benefit indirectly from the Chips Act. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has talked about the need to build more redundancy into the business to mitigate future supply chain disruptions. He even said Nvidia could partner with Intel's new foundry services business -- a business that most definitely would get a boost if the Chips Act is passed.
In addition to lawmaker activity, Nvidia also announced the dates and opened registration for its autumn GPU Technology Conference (GTC). Nvidia's annual event will take place Sept. 19 to Sept. 22, 2022. Registration is free and can be found here.
Now what
Nvidia's GTC in September is likely to be a big deal. The next generation of high-end video game GPUs are expected to be announced, and loads of other developments and free education will be doled out for consumers, developers, and businesses alike.
In mid-August, shareholders can also expect an update on second-quarter financial results. Nvidia provided an outlook for revenue to grow 24% year over year at the midpoint of guidance during its Q1 earnings report in May.

2022-07-22 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Was Up This Week,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-was-up-this-week,"What happened
Week to date, shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were up 9.5% as of 12:59 p.m. ET on Friday, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Nvidia got a boost this week after the Senate voted to pass the Chips for America Act that would provide subsidies for semiconductor companies.
Investors are digesting this positive development along with a weak outlook for Nvidia in the near term, as prices collapse for graphics chips.
So what
The Senate bill would provide over $50 billion in subsidies and tax credits for U.S. chip companies, which is intended to strengthen America's chip supply chain.
In other news, analysts are slashing their estimates for Nvidia's gaming segment, which comprised nearly half of total revenue last quarter. Graphics cards from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have fallen by double-digit percentages in recent weeks, as demand weakens across the PC market. The International Data Corporation's latest report showed a 15% decline in PC shipments in the second quarter, which could impact Nvidia's earnings results.
Now what
Nvidia will report fiscal second-quarter earnings on Aug. 24. Management already expects a deceleration in revenue growth. Investors will be looking for insight from management on the outlook for the rest of the year, especially as it relates to Nvidia's data center segment and release schedule for Nvidia's GeForce RTX 40 series gaming chips.
Data center has benefited from robust spending on hardware to power advanced computing workloads. Nvidia reported growth of 83% year over year in data center in the most recent quarter. But near-term weakness in consumer spending has taken over the narrative for now. The consensus analyst estimate has Nvidia growing full-year revenue by 24%.

2022-07-25 00:00:00+00:00,"2 Growth Stocks That Could Turn $100,000 Into $1 Million by 2030",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-growth-stocks-that-could-turn-%24100000-into-%241-million-by-2030,"The S&P 500 has delivered impressive annual average returns over the past decade and investors should consider using this year's sharp stock market decline as an opportunity to add some great companies to their portfolios at attractive valuations. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) are two such companies that are worth buying now.
Both tech stocks have generated healthy returns for investors over the past several years. A $100,000 investment in Applied Materials at the beginning of 2014 was worth roughly $1 million at the end of 2021, assuming the dividends were reinvested. Nvidia, on the other hand, generated much bigger returns, turning $100,000 into roughly $7.8 million over the same period.
The growth drivers that these companies are sitting on could help them deliver such eye-popping returns over the next eight years as well. Let's see why Nvidia and Applied Materials have the potential to make more investors into millionaires by 2030.
1. Nvidia
Nvidia stock is up 20% so far this month, but shares of the graphics card specialist are still down 40% for the year. Investors who have been waiting to buy this tech stock may want to act while Nvidia's valuation is still at a relatively attractive level.
The chipmaker is trading at 47 times trailing earnings and 33 times forward earnings estimates. Those multiples represent a discount to its five-year average price-to-earnings ratio of 58. The stock is tempting because the company is sitting on bigger catalysts as compared to 2014.
The company reported $4.1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2014, which ended on Jan. 26, 2014, when it was mainly known for selling graphics cards for powering personal computers (PCs). Nvidia had started making moves in the data center market at that time, and that has paid off handsomely over the years.
In the year ended Jan. 30, 2022, the company reported revenue of $26.9 billion, with the data center business producing $10.6 billion of the total
The good part is that the data center business isn't done growing yet. Sales of data center accelerators such as CPUs (central processing units), GPUs (graphics processing units), and DPUs (data processing units) are expected to grow at 40% a year through 2030, generating nearly $156 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period.
Nvidia is well placed to take advantage of this massive opportunity thanks to its solid market share in data center GPUs. More importantly, the company is all set to expand its addressable market in data centers when it enters the server processor market with its Grace CPUs next year, which have already been selected by several customers for deployment from the first half of 2023.
The data center market alone could turn out to be a massive tailwind for Nvidia through 2030 and give its top and bottom lines a big boost. Analysts are expecting the company's earnings to grow at an annual pace of 23% for the next five years, but it won't be surprising to see it clock faster growth for a longer time, thanks to opportunities in the data center and other emerging areas. The stock could rocket over the next eight years.
2. Applied Materials
Semiconductor stocks have taken a beating in 2022, with the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index down 27% so far this year. However, the demand for chips remains healthy thanks to the growing usage of chips in several applications ranging from smartphones to data centers to gaming consoles to cars and even factories.
Market research firm IDC forecasts a 13.7% increase in semiconductor sales this year to $661 billion. That's significantly higher than the industry's 2013 revenue of $305 billion. The semiconductor industry is expected to generate $1 trillion in annual revenue by 2030, according to McKinsey. Other third-party estimates peg the size of the semiconductor market at $1.2 trillion by 2030.
As such, the demand for the semiconductor manufacturing equipment that Applied Materials sells should remain strong in the long run. The company is already benefiting from a spike in capital spending by chipmakers, as evident from the 16% year-over-year increase in its revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2022, which started in November.
Analysts are upbeat about the company's prospects and expect its earnings to increase at a compound annual rate of nearly 14% for the next five years. Even better, Applied Materials sports a dividend yield of 1.1%. While that may not look like much, it is worth noting that the company has increased its dividend for the past five years and has a payout ratio of just 12%. This suggests that Applied Materials could keep increasing its dividend. And the healthy prospects of the market it operates in make it look like the stock is capable of replicating its past gains.
Throw in the company's valuation, and it is easy to see why buying Applied Materials stock looks like a no-brainer right now. The stock trades at just 13.7 times trailing earnings -- a nice discount to the S&P 500's multiple of 20.

3 Highly-Ranked Stocks With Stellar Projected Growth
It’s undoubtedly been a rough year to be an investor so far. A challenging macroeconomic backdrop has caused widespread margin compression, leaving stocks to tumble.
However, the general market’s performance over the last month is a major positive, signaling that bears could be tiring out.
The chart below illustrates the S&P 500’s performance over the last month.
Now that we’re finally seeing some buyers return, it’s beneficial for investors to carry strong stocks with robust growth projections.
Three highly-ranked stocks with promising bottom and top-line growth forecasts include Quanex Building Products, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and Kronos Worldwide.
The chart below illustrates the share performance of all three companies over the last year while blending in the S&P 500 as a benchmark.
Let’s get into why these companies would be solid bets moving forward.
Quanex Building Products
Quanex Building Products Corporation is an industry-leading manufacturer of components sold to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in the building products industry.
Analysts have been raising their earnings outlook across nearly all timeframes, helping push the company into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
The company’s projected top and bottom-line growth rates are stellar.
For the current fiscal year (FY22), the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate resides at $2.35, penciling in a sizable double-digit 35% expansion in the bottom-line year-over-year.
Projected top-line growth is also rock-solid; Quanex Building Products is projected to generate $1.2 billion in sales in FY22, good enough for an 11% uptick in annual revenue from FY21.
The chart below illustrates the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.
In addition, NX sports enticing valuation metrics, bolstered by its Style Score of an A for Value. Its 10.3X forward earnings multiple is well below its five-year median of 18.6X and represents an attractive 42% discount relative to the S&P 500.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world’s largest circuit foundry responsible for supplying microchips to an elite list of companies, including Apple, Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices.
Analysts have been bullish across all timeframes over the last 60 days, landing the company into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
Top and bottom-line forecasts allude to serious growth.
For the current fiscal year (FY22), the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate resides at $6.30, notching a stellar 53% expansion of the bottom-line year-over-year.
The growth doesn’t stop there – TSM is forecasted to generate a mighty $77.8 billion in revenue in FY22, good enough for a 37% double-digit uptick from FY21 sales of $56.8 billion.
Additionally, TSM sports an enticing 13.4X forward earnings multiple, nowhere near its five-year median of 19.9X and representing a substantial 24% discount relative to the general market.
Kronos Worldwide
Kronos Worldwide is a leading producer and marketer of TiO2, a white pigment for providing whiteness, brightness, and opacity. The company is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
Kronos has been on a nice earnings streak, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by an average of 24% over the last four quarters and recording an impressive 78% bottom-line beat in its latest earnings release.
In addition, KRO is forecasted to grow at a breakneck pace.
For the current fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate resides at $2.06, displaying a jaw-dropping triple-digit growth in earnings year-over-year of more than 110%.
Top-line growth is also remarkable; Kronos is projected to generate $2.3 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year (FY22), penciling in a rock-solid 16% increase in annual sales year-over-year.
KRO’s Style Score of an A for Value indicates that shares could be undervalued.
The company’s forward earnings multiple sits enticingly at 8.4X, a fraction of its five-year median value of 14.2X. In addition, shares trade at a steep 52% discount relative to the general market.
Bottom Line
The rebound is long overdue, with buyers returning and pushing bears back into hibernation. As we continue to navigate the rough economic waters we’ve found ourselves in, market participants are hopeful this recent strength can continue.

2022-08-01 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Nvidia Are Rising Today",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-meta-platforms-amazon-and-nvidia-are-rising-today,"What happened
Shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were all making gains this morning as investors continued their cautious optimism in tech stocks that began last month.
As a result, Meta stock gained 2.3%, Amazon climbed 1.2%, and Nvidia rose 2% as of 12:45 p.m. ET.
So what
Investors dipped their toes back into tech stocks last month following a months-long exodus from the sector. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down 20% year to date as investors have processed the news of skyrocketing inflation, Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, and fears that the economy could end up in a recession.
Image source: Getty Images.
But last month some investors started regaining at least a little confidence in tech stocks again as they likely thought that most of the economic concerns and inflation woes are already baked into companies' stock price drops.
As a result, the Nasdaq Composite popped 12% last month. Amazon and Nvidia benefited from the tech stock surge last month, as they gained 27% and 19%, respectively. And it appears that investors are continuing that sentiment for tech stocks today, helping to drive Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia higher today.
Now what
What's interesting about some of these stocks' share price gains today is that, in some cases, recent company news hasn't been all that great.
For example, Meta reported its second-quarter results last week in which revenue fell on a year-over-year basis for the first time ever. The company's sales and earnings also missed analysts' consensus estimates.
But investors may be focusing on the positives right now and instead looking at Amazon's second-quarter revenue growth that beat Wall Street's average estimate and even factoring in Apple's better-than-expected second-quarter results that were reported last week.
Additionally, Nvidia investors pushed the stock higher last week after the U.S. Senate passed the CHIPS for America Act, which will provide subsidies and tax credits for some semiconductor companies.
While it's still unclear how much Nvidia will directly benefit from it, the bill could be a boon to the broader chip industry -- with about $50 billion set aside for chip companies. Nvidia investors seized on the fact that the U.S. chip industry as a whole could benefit and pushed the company's share price up more than 9% last week.
While Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia investors are no doubt pleased with the recent share price gains of these stocks, they should also understand that there's likely some more volatility ahead for the tech sector.
With more Federal Reserve interest rate hikes potentially on the way and inflation still at a 40-year high, these stocks could reverse some of the gains they've made recently.
Additionally, Nvidia will report its second-quarter financial results on Aug. 24 and investors will want to keep a close eye on any changes in consumer spending that might affect the company's gaming graphics processing unit sales, as well as any potential decline in the company's important data center sales segment.

2022-08-02 00:00:00+00:00,3 Humbled Nasdaq Stocks Ready to Bounce Back,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-humbled-nasdaq-stocks-ready-to-bounce-back-3,"Some tech stocks are getting too cheap to ignore, but not all of them are good buys right now. Growth stocks took a beating over the past year or so, as rising interest rates and recession fears eliminated investor risk tolerance. These three stocks took a beating in recent months, but they still have great long-term prospects.
1. Nvidia
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was one of the darlings of the pandemic bull market. The semiconductor stock rode a wave of strong results and investor momentum to become one of the largest companies in the world. Its price-to-sales ratio peaked close to 35, and its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio swelled to 75. Those sorts of valuations weren't sustainable when investors moved away from growth stocks about nine months ago.
Nvidia is much more reasonably priced now. Its forward P/E ratio is around 34, and its price-to-sales is down to 15. Last quarter, the company reported record sales after growing 45%. Nvidia semiconductors are state-of-the-art market leaders in several major growth categories, including data centers, gaming, automation, and robotics. Nvidia has set itself up to be one of the greatest beneficiaries of the emerging tech trends that should define the near future. It's also shrewdly investing in next-generation quantum computing so that it can stay afloat when its current product portfolio becomes obsolete.

Ongoing rate hikes and a potential recession could hurt Nvidia's growth rate, which probably result in the stock dropping further. That shouldn't dissuade investors who love the company. Its valuation is reasonable enough for long-term investors to enjoy gains as the company's cash flows expand.
2. Datadog
Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) provides application monitoring and security for cloud software. Its product helps customers to maximize the performance of their digital operations. and capability of their cloud while protecting against threats. That's relevant for almost every company in the modern economy, and it's a major point of emphasis as software influences every aspect of operations. Those are fantastic growth catalysts.
Gartner gives high marks to Datadog, naming it a leader in the application performance monitoring industry. Datadog's customers seem to agree -- its net retention rate is over 130%, indicating that customers are sticking around and expanding their relationship. That's strong evidence of quality and satisfaction.
DDOG PS Ratio data by YCharts
Datadog rode these catalysts to 83% revenue growth last quarter. The company reported net profits and $130 million in free cash flow. That's exciting for investors who are looking for a rare combination of huge growth along with profitability. Datadog stock isn't cheap at price-to-sales ratio above 25 and forward P/E above 140, but it's much cheaper on the basis of fundamentals than it was in December.
3. ZScaler
Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS) is a cybersecurity stock that specializes in edge protection. Cyberattacks are commonplace in the headlines these days, and criminals often access sensitive corporate data through employees and customers. That's exactly what Zscaler aims to stop, and it's considered an industry leader by Gartner.
Zscaler is growing faster than 60%, which is an incredible feat for a company that's on pace to surpass $1 billion in annual revenue. It's not profitable yet, but it produces positive free cash flow, so it's not burning through cash to achieve such impressive growth. In this regard, Zscaler is a lot like Datadog -- it even has very similar valuation ratios. It's hard to call this stock cheap, but Zscaler's value has plenty of room to grow if it stays on this trajectory.

2022-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia Stock Can Thrive Despite CHIPS Act Pressure,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-can-thrive-despite-chips-act-pressure,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Although Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has moved higher in the past month, inflation, higher interest rates and recession worries are certainly continuing to put pressure it.
But that’s not all. Industry-specific developments are also hurting its near-term performance. Namely, the CHIPS Act, which recently made its way through Congress.
This bill, which will provide subsidies to the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing industry, is seen as good news for chip makers who produce their own chips, but bad news for “fabless” chip companies like Nvidia, which outsource production.
However, even if rivals stand to benefit from billions in government largesse, that doesn’t mean this purveyor of GPUs and CPUs stands to see zero benefit. Let’s dive in, and see why the CHIPS Act doesn’t change my view on Nvidia’s long-term prospects.
NVDA Stock and the CHIPS Act
Before exploring the possible impact of the CHIPS Act on Nvidia, we’ll first take a look at this legislation itself. U.S. politicians (both Democrats and Republicans) are looking to bring more chip production back to the United States.
Largely, this is due to national security worries. With the U.S. dependent on chips manufactured in Asia, there’s concern that this leaves America in a vulnerable position. To promote reshoring of chip production, the CHIPS Act provides $52.7 billion in subsidies for new U.S. chip fabrication facilities. It also provides around $24 billion in related tax incentives.
On July 27, the U.S. Senate approved the bill, which is officially known as the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. Then, the House of Representatives passed it and President Joe Biden is ready to sign it into law. Again, this bill is seen as bad news for NVDA stock, as it disproportionately benefits its rivals, like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
Even so, taking a closer look suggests that the opposite instead may be true. That is, instead of being a major negative, this legislation ends up being a modest positive for the company.
Why This Bill Doesn’t Change the Story With Nvidia
To some, the CHIPS Act may seem like a case of the U.S. government picking winners and losers. Yet while Nvidia isn’t directly “winning” from this bill, it’s not exactly “losing” either. Why? Two reasons.
First, federal support of the U.S. chip manufacturing industry could be a small positive for the company. It may reduce its dependence on Asian production facilities. This could limit future supply disruptions.
Second, although the CHIPS Act gives an edge to Intel in production, it does little to give Intel a leg up in chip design and innovation. That continues to be one of Nvidia’s key areas of strength. That’s why it continues to dominate the discrete GPU market, with 78% market share.
It’s also why it continues to see robust demand for its GPUs among end-user areas like cloud computing and gaming. Not to mention, it’s the reason why the company is well-positioned to dominate in emerging areas like self-driving vehicles and the metaverse. Doing little to affect its main strength, this bill will not change the story with NVDA stock.
The Verdict
My view on shares remains unchanged. Nvidia stock continues to earn a B rating in my Portfolio Grader. That’s not to say concerns about this bill will no longer have an impact on its stock price. We could see more volatility due to this bill. The uncertainties that have affected Nvidia’s price performance this year could also continue to put pressure on it.
Even so, that’s not a reason to skip on it. In the months ahead, it could become clear that demand in areas like cloud computing could outweigh a drop in demand due to a recession, such as with gaming chips. Put simply, the market is overly pessimistic about how it will fare under more challenging economic conditions.
The same may apply here, with the market’s view on the CHIPS Act. If you’ve been looking to buy NVDA stock, take advantage of a possible overreaction to this development.

2022-08-05 00:00:00+00:00,Is Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (PSI) a Strong ETF Right Now?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-invesco-dynamic-semiconductors-etf-psi-a-strong-etf-right-now-3,"The Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (PSI) was launched on 06/23/2005, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Technology ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.
Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
The fund is managed by Invesco, and has been able to amass over $615.26 million, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Technology ETFs. Before fees and expenses, PSI seeks to match the performance of the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index.
The Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index is comprised of stocks of semiconductor companies. The Index is designed to provide capital appreciation by thoroughly evaluating companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including fundamental growth, stock valuation, investment timeliness and risk factors.
Cost & Other Expenses
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.56%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
PSI's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 0.31%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
ETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
Representing 97% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector.
Taking into account individual holdings, Nvidia Corp (NVDA) accounts for about 5.47% of the fund's total assets, followed by Qualcomm Inc (QCOM) and Broadcom Inc (AVGO).
The top 10 holdings account for about 45.4% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF has lost about -24.83% and is down about -10.19% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 08/05/2022), respectively. PSI has traded between $92.29 and $155.95 during this last 52-week period.
The ETF has a beta of 1.34 and standard deviation of 40.38% for the trailing three-year period, making it a high risk choice in the space. With about 31 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.
Alternatives
Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Technology ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.
VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) tracks MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) tracks PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index. VanEck Semiconductor ETF has $7.29 billion in assets, iShares Semiconductor ETF has $7.52 billion. SMH has an expense ratio of 0.35% and SOXX charges 0.43%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Technology ETFs.

2022-08-08 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Partners With ECARX to Launch In-Vehicle Computing Platform,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-partners-with-ecarx-to-launch-in-vehicle-computing-platform,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD recently announced that it has formed a strategic collaboration with ECARX, a global mobility tech company, to develop an in-vehicle computing platform for next-generation electric vehicles (EVs).
The ECARX digital cockpit is the very first in-vehicle platform to be integrated with AMD Ryzen Embedded V2000 processors and AMD Radeon RX 6000 Series GPUs along with ECARX hardware and software. The digital cockpit will feature high-end features including driver information mode, heads-up display and rear seat entertainment, multiple-displays, multi-zone voice recognition, high-end gaming and a full 3D user experience.
The ECARX digital cockpit is expected to be in mass production for global rollout in late 2023, which will mark AMD’s entry into the high growth EV industry.
Per International Data Corporation (“IDC”), PC sales were down 15.3% year over year to 71.3 million units during the June quarter, which was higher than the first-quarter's decline rate of 5.1% and is the worst drop in many years.
In the second quarter, AMD’s Client segment which includes desktop and notebook PC processors surged 24.5% year over year to $2.15 billion and accounted for 32.9% of total revenues. While the company experienced rising revenues, the company is expecting slowing growth in the coming third and fourth quarters due to falling demand for PCs.
To counter this issue, AMD has been diversifying its product portfolio to cater to trending high growth markets like cloud, gaming, data center and EV.
The company has constantly been improving the performance of its Ryzen processors to help address the increasing proliferation of AI and Machine Learning (ML) in industries like cloud, gaming and data center.
This has impacted AMD's second-quarter 2022 gross margin positively, which expanded 600 basis points (bps) year over year to 54%.

AMD Forays Into High Growth Markets to Boost Share Prices
AMD's shares which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have slumped 28.9% compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector's decline of 22.3% in the year-to-date period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
The fall in AMD’s share price was due to the rising geo-political tensions between the United States and China, the global supply chain challenges that have adversely impacted the semiconductor industry, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, rising inflation and interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has led to the recent fall in PC demand as the market slips into recession.
Stiff competition from peers like NVIDIA NVDA also remains a concern as AMD is looking to gain market share in one of its most beneficial markets, AI.
NVIDIA has been benefiting from the rapid proliferation of AI. The company has been expanding its base in untapped markets like climate science, energy research, space exploration and digital biology.
Nvidia recently teamed up with Hewlett Packard Enterprise to bring AI software services to the cloud. NVIDIA AI enterprise is now available in Hewlett Packard Greenlake in select countries.
However, AMD has been gaining from its plans to form strategic partnerships with different companies to address new-high growth markets, accelerate data center growth, and enter the AI and AR spaces with its launch of various new products.
AMD recently collaborated with Dell Technologies DELL to launch the most powerful 17” AMD Advantage laptop — Alienware m17 r5 Gaming Laptop.
The recent collaboration with Dell will help AMD benefit from the rising gaming industry that will attain $545.98 billion by 2028, witnessing a CAGR of 13.20% between 2021 and 2028, according to Fortune Business Insights.
AMD has also collaborated with Meta Platforms META to enter the Metaverse.
AMD has become Meta’s ecosystem partner, and AMD’s radio chip, Xilinx Zynq UltraScale RFSoC, will be utilized to develop a metaverse-ready radio access unit.
AMD’s recent partnership with ECARX will help the company address the growing EV demand. Per AMD, which quoted Strategy Analytics, EV adoption is an important factor for growth in the automotive semiconductor market and the associated semiconductor demand is expected to see a CAAGR of 31% over 2021-2026.

How to Profit from the Hot Electric Vehicle Industry
Global electric car sales in 2021 more than doubled their 2020 numbers. And today, the electric vehicle (EV) technology and very nature of the business is changing quickly. The next push for future technologies is happening now and investors who get in early could see exceptional profits.

2022-08-09 00:00:00+00:00,US STOCKS-Nasdaq slides 1% as chipmaker Micron's warning renews tech rout,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-nasdaq-slides-1-as-chipmaker-microns-warning-renews-tech-rout,"By Herbert Lash and Bansari Mayur Kamdar
Aug 9 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq fell on Tuesday after a dismal forecast from Micron Technology pulled chip and technology stocks lower as markets await U.S. inflation data that could lead the Federal Reserve to further tighten its aggressive plans to curb inflation.
High inflation numbers on Wednesday, following last week's blowout jobs report, would likely stop the Fed from easing interest rates hikes and halt a nascent recovery in stocks.
Traders see a 68.5% chance of the Fed raising rates by 75 basis points in September, in what would be its third big hike in a row.
Adding to concerns of a tight labor market and runaway inflation, data on Tuesday showed an acceleration of unit labor costs in the second quarter, which suggested strong wage pressures will help keep inflation elevated.
Unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - rose at a 10.8% rate, following a 12.7% rate of growth in the first quarter, the Labor Department said.
""We're still seeing wage pressure building, using last Friday's job data as a gauge,"" said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office.
While Change remains cautious about the market's outlook, he said ""I don't think it's going to be a set of numbers that will change the Fed’s policy course.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJIfell 65.41 points, or 0.2%, to 32,767.13, while the S&P 500 .SPXlost 19.78 points, or 0.48%, to 4,120.28 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXICdropped 154.45 points, or 1.22%, to 12,490.01.
Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors fell, with consumer discretionary .SPLRCD, information technology .SPLRCT and communication services .SPLRCL down between 0.8% and 1.6%.
Micron Technology MU.O slid 3.7% after the memory-chipmaker cut its fourth-quarter revenue forecast and warned of negative free cash flow the following quarter as demand ebbs for chips used in personal computers and smartphones.
Micron's warning, a day after Nvidia Corp NVDA.O forecast weakness in its gaming business, knocked the Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX 4.39% lower, with all 30 components down. The index has fallen almost 8% the past three days.
""It does add to a general growing realization that the move the market experienced in July was probably more of a counter-trend rally in a deteriorating economic situation for both companies (Micron and Nvidia),"" said Robert Stimpson, chief investment officer at Oak Associates Funds.
President Joe Biden signed a sweeping bill to provide $52.7 billion in subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production and research, a measure that gained bipartisan support to combat China's investment in technology.
""It's utterly discounted,"" said Michael Shaoul, chief executive officer at Marketfield, on why chip stocks were unfazed by the bill.
Rate-sensitive growth and technology stocks slipped as U.S. Treasury yields climbed, with megacaps such as Amazon.com AMZN.O and Tesla TSLA.O down more than 1% each. US/
Despite a choppy recovery since mid-June, the benchmark index .SPX is down 13.5% this year after hitting a record high in early January as surging consumer prices, hawkish central banks and geopolitical tensions weigh.
Stronger-than-expected earnings from corporate America have been a positive, with 77.5% of S&P 500 companies beating earnings estimates, according to Refinitiv data as of Friday.
Occidental Petroleum OXY.Nrose 3.5% to $62.14 after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway BRKa.N increased its stake to 20.2% of outstanding shares. Occidental's shares have more than doubled in price this year.
U.S. vaccine maker Novavax NVAX.O slumped 30.3% after it halved its annual revenue forecast as it does not expect further sales of its COVID-19 shot this year in the United States amid a global supply glut and soft demand.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.64-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted four new 52-week highs and 30 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 41 new highs and 62 new lows.

2022-08-10 00:00:00+00:00,The Curious Reason Nvidia Stock Popped Today,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-curious-reason-nvidia-stock-popped-today,"What happened
After going through a rough patch, shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) finally turned higher on Wednesday, gaining as much as 6%. When the market closed, shares were still up 5.9%.
There's little doubt that the overall bullish market trend helped fuel its rise, but a curious catalyst appears to have helped boost shares: The semiconductor giant assured employees that it wasn't making any sweeping cuts in the wake of its difficult quarter.
So what
The economic uncertainty that has gripped corporations everywhere has resulted in a rash of slowed hiring, job cuts, and layoffs. Reports of slashed head counts have generally been followed by a declining stock price for the companies in question, as they're viewed as harbingers of pain to come. Not so for Nvidia.
CEO Jensen Huang has sought to address the concerns of Nvidia workers. In what is purported to be a leaked company email, its chief executive assured employees that even though its second-quarter results were ""significantly lower than anticipated,"" the company has no plans to discharge staff, according to Business Insider.
""So what does this mean for us? Do we have a layoff? No. Instead, we have given raises to take care of your families as all of you are facing sky-high inflation,"" Huang wrote. ""We will find and eliminate all wasted time, process, and material."" He encouraged employees: ""Take this opportunity to make Nvidia even faster, leaner, and agile.""
Now what
This report comes on the heels of disappointing preliminary financial results released by the semiconductor specialist earlier this week.
Nvidia said its second-quarter revenue of roughly $6.7 billion, while up 3%, would fall far short of the $8.1 billion it guided for just three months ago. Management noted that the shortfall was primarily the result of weaker-than-expected revenue in its gaming segment, which is now expected to generate $2.04 billion, down 33% year over year.
The company said weak channel partner sales were likely the result of ""macroeconomic headwinds."" The issue was further exacerbated by discounts meant to clear excess inventory.
Consumers have faced record-high inflation in recent months, so it isn't particularly surprising that chip sales might suffer. However, given the transitory nature of the issue, I think Nvidia stock is still a buy.

2022-08-11 00:00:00+00:00,See Which Of The Latest 13F Filers Holds NVIDIA,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/see-which-of-the-latest-13f-filers-holds-nvidia-1,"At Holdings Channel, we have reviewed the latest batch of the 83 most recent 13F filings for the 06/30/2022 reporting period, and noticed that NVIDIA Corp (Symbol: NVDA) was held by 34 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.
Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.
Having given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in NVDA positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:

In terms of shares owned, we count 12 of the above funds having increased existing NVDA positions from 03/31/2022 to 06/30/2022, with 17 having decreased their positions and 3 new positions. Worth noting is that Alliance Wealth Management Group, Cypress Capital Management LLC, Pine Haven Investment Counsel Inc, and Stegent Equity Advisors Inc., included in this recent batch of 13F filers, exited NVDA common stock as of 06/30/2022.
Looking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the NVDA share count in the aggregate among all of the funds which held NVDA at the 06/30/2022 reporting period (out of the 3,616 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of NVDA shares those same funds held back at the 03/31/2022 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for NVDA. We found that between these two periods, funds reduced their holdings by 13,969,332 shares in the aggregate, from 260,832,220 down to 246,862,888 for a share count decline of approximately -5.36%.

2022-08-12 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia Stock Is Down 48% -- Is It Time to Buy?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-is-down-48-is-it-time-to-buy,"Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) share prices are down by over 48% since hitting their peak in November 2021. In 2021, this full-stack technology company's stock benefited dramatically from increasing digitization in the enterprise and consumer segments.
The year 2022 has proved challenging for this semiconductor company. Nvidia is suffering from weakness in the gaming and crypto business as consumers prefer to delay discretionary spending in the current recessionary environment. The company's preliminary financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended July 31, 2022) have missed both the company's guidance as well as the analyst consensus estimates. Despite being mainly due to tougher prior-year comps, the slowing top-line growth has negatively affected investor sentiment.
However, demand in the data center and automobile segments has remained strong. Considering that the stock has corrected significantly from its highs, investors may want to assess this stock now.
The data center is a rapidly growing market
As per preliminary financial results, in the second quarter, Nvidia's data center revenue was up 61% year over year to $3.81 billion. The data center business now accounts for nearly 56% of the company's total revenue. The company offers a broad suite of data center-focused hardware such as GPUs, CPUs, and DPUs (data processing units). Additionally, Nvidia also offers a CUDA toolkit, which is an environment for developers to easily build GPU-accelerated applications as well as GPU-optimized software libraries, targeting the needs of the data center industry.
Nvidia's data center offerings are being used in supercomputing centers, enterprise computing data centers, hyperscalers, and cloud computing. Thanks to its broad catalog of product and software offerings catering to all the needs of the data center, every major cloud provider such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet is now using the company's chips.
The use of the company's technologically superior and cost-efficient data center chips is expected to become even more relevant in the current recessionary environment. Hence, being a leader in accelerated computing, Nvidia is well poised to benefit from the rapid expansion in the global data center accelerator market (expected to be worth $75.2 billion by 2027).
Autonomous driving could be a major growth driver
Nvidia has introduced a range of hardware, software, and infrastructure solutions to target the autonomous driving opportunity. Nvidia DRIVE Orin system-on-a-chip (SoC) is a very powerful and intelligent chip capable of processing huge amounts of data (feeds from interior and exterior cameras, RADARS, ultrasonic sensors, and LiDAR or light detection and ranging sonar) in a very short time. It acts like the brain of the computer -- a must for autonomous driving. More than 25 vehicle manufacturers have opted for this SoC, which is currently in production. The company also offers the Nvidia DRIVE Hyperion integrated hardware and software platform for automakers to develop, test, and validate customized autonomous driving solutions. Nvidia estimates its design wins in the automotive industry to be worth $11 billion for the next six years.
Is Nvidia a buy now?
Nvidia's recently published second-quarter results are quite disappointing. While this has affected the analyst and investor sentiment for the stock, the company's fundamental story remains strong. Nvidia is a company with a significant technological advantage and a robust balance sheet (cash balance of $20.34 billion and total debt of $11.85 billion at the end of the first quarter). The company plans to repurchase shares worth $15 billion by the end of December 2023, thereby returning significant value to shareholders.
Nvidia is currently valued at 177 times forward earnings. While this valuation seems lofty, it is significantly lower than the levels the company traded at in 2021.
There is no question that Nvidia is a risky stock -- especially with the slowdown in the gaming industry and crypto price crash, which may result in a prolonged reduction in GPU demand as well as GPU prices.
However, despite the risks, Nvidia remains an amazing business. With prices somewhat corrected, a small investment in this stock may prove to be a good decision for retail investors.

2022-08-15 00:00:00+00:00,3 High-Growth Stocks That Could Be Worth $1 Trillion in 10 Years -- Or Sooner,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-high-growth-stocks-that-could-be-worth-%241-trillion-in-10-years-or-sooner-1,"Looking for future $1 trillion stocks using a decade time span may seem like picking your own starting point when running a marathon, but it is an interesting exercise nonetheless. That's especially true when you consider the three high-growth stocks we will look at today: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), ASML (NASDAQ: ASML), and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI).
While Nvidia and ASML ""only"" need share price growth of 9% and 17% annually over the next decade to reach this mark, MercadoLibre would need a stunning 35% yearly return.
Despite this wide range of required returns, there is plenty of reason to argue that these businesses could become $1 trillion stocks over the next decade -- or perhaps even sooner.
1. Nvidia: Current market cap is $469.5 billion
Intent to pick up where it believes Moore's Law is beginning to tail off, Nvidia and its accelerated computing platform has produced some incredible earnings results over the past decade. That has led to the stock's gain of nearly 5,000% over those 10 years.
Led primarily by its gaming and data center operations -- which combined to account for 86% of Nvidia's 2022 sales -- the company grew to a market capitalization of $800 billion by late November 2021 before dropping nearly 44% from its 52-week high.
At the core of this drop was an intense technology-based sell-off that saw the Nasdaq-100 index briefly down a whopping 48% from its 52-week high. Making matters worse for Nvidia, it recently announced preliminary earnings where management stated that fiscal 2023 second-quarter revenue would be closer to $6.7 billion instead of the $8.1 billion guided for initially. Particularly troublesome is the slowdown in its gaming division, which expects a sales decline of 33% year over year for Q2 amid softening consumer spending.
So why is Nvidia an excellent pick to reach a $1 trillion market cap?
Look no further than the company's other-worldly artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions and data center operations. Recording triple-digit year-over-year sales growth from its hyperscale cloud customers in Q1 of 2023, Nvidia is deeply ingrained in a market that projects to grow by 29% annually through 2026.
Nvidia boasts over 3 million developers and its products are in use by every major cloud provider. The company looks to not only bring high-performance computing to its massive customers but AI software that runs the gamut on use cases. Currently trading with a market capitalization of nearly $470 billion, Nvidia is a good bet to reach $1 trillion by 2032 -- especially with its price-to-earnings ratio being cut in half to 50 over the last two years.
2. ASML: Current market cap is $226.5 billion
While Nvidia looks to build off a decline from Moore's Law, ASML plans to extend the law's life as far as possible with its one-of-a-kind deep ultraviolet (DUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems. Lithography is the process of using light to ""print"" increasingly small patterns onto silicon wafers used in semiconductor chips.
However, ASML is interesting because it has a leadership position in the more mature DUV market and a near monopoly with its bleeding edge EUV systems. This domination and importance to its customers have led to incredible pricing power, which has helped the company's stock produce total returns of around 700% since 2012.
Just how strong is this pricing power and the subsequently wide moat it creates? Consider the following chart.
ASML Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.
Thanks to this absurd 49% free cash flow margin, ASML has more than quadrupled its dividend payments over the last five years while its payout ratio has remained consistently below 50%.
ASML Dividends Paid (TTM) data by YCharts.
While this growing dividend (currently yielding 1.4%) should theoretically slow ASML's growth trajectory, the company has grown sales by 16%, 21%, and 20% annually over the last year, three years, and five years.
Requiring a 17% annual return to reach our goal, ASML's combination of steady revenue growth, incredible free cash flow creation, and a reasonable price-to-free cash flow ratio of 22 should help power the stock to $1 trillion.
3. MercadoLibre: Current market cap is $54.2 billion
Right out of the gates, I'll admit this one may be a stretch to reach $1 trillion by 2032 -- especially considering MercadoLibre's market capitalization of only $50 billion. However, the Latin American e-commerce and fintech juggernaut has two massive tailwinds working in its favor.
First, as of January of 2020, the World Bank estimated that only 55% of adults in Latin America had a financial account with a banking institution. While this figure has improved in the following two years, it is still jarring to see -- especially compared to the fact that only 5% of United States households do not have a bank account. Furthermore, many of these adults with some form of a bank account are still severely ""underbanked,"" as they have historically not had access to nearly the variety of financial products as U.S. citizens.
Second, e-commerce only accounted for roughly 5% of Latin American retail sales as of 2021. Contrast this mark with the U.S.'s figure of 20% and it is clear to see that online sales are just beginning to hit their long-term growth trajectory in the region.
Thanks to this underbanked population and nascent e-commerce industry, MercadoLibre is still in the early chapters of its growth story -- despite rising over 1,000% in the last decade.
Now with 41 million unique buyers shopping on MercadoLibre and 38 million active customers using its fintech products, the company has amassed a massive user base.
For Q2 of 2022, its commerce segment grew by only 23% year over year, lapping incredible Q2 2021 growth of 101%, while the fintech unit grew by a stunning 107% for the quarter. Now accounting for 46% of MercadoLibre's sales, these rapidly growing fintech sales have the company poised to transform into a finance-first, retail-second enterprise.
Trading at six times sales, the company's valuation is lower than it has been in the last 10 years.
MELI PS Ratio data by YCharts.
This lower valuation, paired with the company's 53% annualized revenue growth rate over the last five years and burgeoning fintech unit, has me optimistic that MercadoLibre may just provide the needed returns to reach $1 trillion by 2032.

2022-08-16 00:00:00+00:00,These 3 Semiconductor Stocks Could Be Great Buys Right Now,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-3-semiconductor-stocks-could-be-great-buys-right-now,"Investors in the stock market love a good acronym. After all, ""FAANG,"" coined by business news personality Jim Cramer, has been used for years to describe some of the greatest technology stocks in the U.S.
I'm going to introduce you to the ""MAN"" stocks: Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).
They're three of the largest producers of advanced computer chips (semiconductors) in the world. Their industry is constantly growing in importance, as more products and services rely on digital capabilities to serve consumers and businesses. Here's why investors should consider buying these MAN stocks now and holding them for the long run.
1. Micron Technology: A leader in memory and storage chips
The memory (DRAM) and data storage (NAND) chip businesses aren't nearly as flashy or exciting as graphics or processing, but they play an important role in some of consumers' most prized electronics. Micron is a global leader in the space, and there are some emerging opportunities that could supercharge the company's growth.
At the moment, use cases like personal computing and the data center make up the majority of Micron's revenue, and the company continues to drive innovation. In fact, it just released the world's fastest graphics memory solution in partnership with Nvidia, which will be used in that company's next-generation GeForce RTX graphics chips.
But Micron's smaller segments might hold the most promise in the long run. In the fiscal third quarter of 2022 (ended June 2), the company's automotive revenue hit an all-time high, and it anticipates a further surge in demand thanks to 100 new electric vehicle (EV) models being launched worldwide in 2022. Micron describes EVs as data centers on wheels, and that means they will require more memory and storage capacity than ever before.
The company is also benefiting from the transition to the 5G network, with 5G-enabled mobile devices expected to hit 50% penetration of the total addressable market this year. Compared to their 4G-enabled predecessors, these devices require 50% more memory and double the storage.
By the close of fiscal 2022 (Sept. 2), Micron expects it will have generated $31.3 billion in sales and $7.90 in earnings per share. Analysts predict a drop in both metrics during fiscal 2023 under tighter economic conditions. But for the best returns, investors should certainly view Micron through a 10-year lens.
2. Advanced Micro Devices: Powering the most popular products and services
If there were rock stars in the semiconductor industry, Advanced Micro Devices would be one of them. It makes some of the most sought-after chips for personal computing, gaming, and the data center, and the list of use cases is only growing longer -- thanks in part to the company's recent $49 billion acquisition of Xilinx, the world leader in adaptive computing.
AMD's chips are responsible for powering products and services for consumers and businesses alike, giving the company diverse exposure to the broader economy. It serves the world's largest providers of cloud services in its data center segment, including the industry's top two giants Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). At Microsoft, AMD chips can also be found in the Surface line of notebook computers and tablet devices, plus the Xbox gaming console.
AMD thinks that the next frontier over the coming decade (and beyond) is adaptive computing, a technology that allows chips to adjust to the user's requirements in real time, without having to swap out hardware. It will be critical for complex computing applications that involve artificial intelligence (AI). And Xilinx has previously indicated that it can deliver performance that's four times faster than the best graphics processors on the market.
Xilinx could supercharge AMD's already red-hot business. The combined companies are expecting to deliver $26.3 billion in revenue for the whole of 2022, a jump of nearly 60% compared to AMD's 2021 result. Plus, analysts expect the company will grow both sales and profitability in 2023. But looked at over the long run, AMD might just be getting warmed up.
3. Nvidia: From hardware to platform computing
The third and last chipmaker in the MAN acronym is Nvidia, a company that is often regarded as a pioneer in artificial intelligence, and is still leading the way today. It's bridging the gap between innovative hardware products and its aspirations to become a platform computing company, if it's not there already.
The company applies AI and machine learning in multiple ways. One of its smaller segments is automotive and robotics, which hosts Nvidia Drive, an end-to-end solution for car manufacturers that want to implement autonomous self-driving technology. Nvidia has already built a sales pipeline of $11 billion from 35 top carmakers, and in 2024, Mercedes-Benz Group will roll out its first Nvidia-driven cars under this program. By 2030, the opportunity in autonomous vehicles could exceed $2.1 trillion annually.
Nvidia has also built a revolutionary 3D rendering platform called Omniverse, which companies like Amazon are using to create lifelike digital replicas of important assets with to-the-millimeter accuracy. As an example, Omniverse allows Amazon to make changes to its fulfillment centers in the virtual sphere before committing time and money to adjusting the real-life versions.
Still, those are segments of the future, and right now gaming and the data center make up 88% of Nvidia's sales. The company will report its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 on Aug. 24; it expects short-term weakness, but for the full year, analysts still anticipate 15% sales growth to $31 billion.
In the long run, demand for technologies driven by AI will only grow, which could result in Nvidia's smaller segments overtaking its larger ones in sales. By one estimate, AI could add $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, offering a hint at Nvidia's long-term potential.

2022-08-17 00:00:00+00:00,7 Stocks That Are Still Hedge Fund Favorites,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-that-are-still-hedge-fund-favorites,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Many of the hedge fund favorites are technology companies, my analysis of the most popular stocks among the 40 largest hedge funds shows. Additionally,  the top five hedge funds in 2022 hold widely followed names like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).
The media tends to  closely cover the stocks that are most widely owned by hedge funds, making those equities popular among retail investors. And after the market rebounded for four straight weeks this summer, investors may want to copy the trades of top hedge funds in order to avoid missing out on the market’s rebound .
The stocks whose grade is in green have the best prospects.
In the quantitative table above, six of the seven firms receive high ratings on quality and growth. Although Uber (NYSE:UBER) has poor grades, the stock still bottomed in the low $20s.
In the smartphone market, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) have strong growth prospects, so hedge funds cannot risk leaving those stocks out of their portfolios.
Although inflation is causing some consumers to reduce their spending on certain items, they are unlikely to avoid upgrading their smartphones. Still, consumers may delay buying the latest Apple iPhone.
But such behavior will only prevent  Apple’s profit from increasing for one or two quarters. In the interim, the vast majority of iPhone users will likely continue to buy apps, listen to Apple Music, and subscribe to Apple TV.
BABA Alibaba $90.57
AAPL Apple $175.67

Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is still a hedge fund favorite despite its growth slowdown and its potential delisting from the NYSE \.
Alibaba, however, has alternatives. For example, the company may list its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, enabling the  current holders of BABA stock  to convert their  holdings to shares listed in Hong Kong.
Softbank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) is planning to sell its shares of Alibaba. Softbank will use contracts to exit its position over time. As a result, the risk of it unloading the stock too quickly will be minimized, reducing the chances of the share price dropping when Softbank sells its BABA stock.
Softbank needs to raise cash because it invested in many illiquid start-up companies.
Apple (AAPL)

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock bottomed at around $130 in early summer.   Apple reportedly told its suppliers to make 90 million of its newest iPhone, the iPhone 14.
Apple enjoys strong brand recognition and customer loyalty. After the  prices of its supplies rose due to inflation, Apple will probably raise iPhone prices. For example, it could keep iPhone 13 prices at their  current levels even after it launches the iPhone 14. After launching new iPhones in the past, Apple has cut the prices of its older models.
This year, investors should expect the company to raise the  prices of its new iPhone by up to 15% versus last year’s new models. Apple’s stores are always packed, suggesting that there is strong demand for the company’s Macbooks, iPads, and smartphones.
In its fiscal third quarter, Apple’s revenue climbed 2% year-over-year to $83 billion,, and it generated earnings per share of $1.20.
Coca-Cola (KO)

Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) reported that its net revenue climbed 12% YOY in Q2. Its global unit case volume grew by 8% YOY. For the full year, the company expects revenue growth of 12%-13%.
CEO James Quincey said that Coca-Cola has accelerated its growth by dominating the industry, while the firm is growing its market share.
While inflation is squeezing consumers’ purchasing power in some parts of the world, in countries like China and Southeast Asia, inflation is only running at around 3% annually. Still, as consumers reprioritize their spending habits, they are not reducing their purchases of Coca-Cola’s products, its CEO reported.
Coca-Cola has a favorable sales mix and, to cope with inflation, it has increased its prices. The company will pass its increased costs onto its customers. Coke’s price hikes will, however, be minimal because it has hedged its exposure to the commodities that it uses.
Coca-Cola will also sustain its profitability by focusing on its productivity. For example, it may seek to develop closer relationships with its key suppliers.
Netflix (NFLX)

Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported that it had lost 970,000 net subscribers in Q2. That was better than its previous guidance of a loss of 2 million net subscribers.
CEO Reed Hastings said that the company had developed strong content. Its successful shows included Ozark and Stranger Things. In addition, the company used marketing to slow the decline of its customer base while improving its service.
The owners of NFLX stock are accepting the fact that the linear growth of the demand for streaming has  ended. In the next few years, Netflix needs to optimize its price changes in order to minimize the turnover of its customers .
It also must create better content to deter customers from canceling their subscriptions.  In the second half of the year, the company expects to generate stronger growth, in-line with its usual seasonal trends.
NVIDIA (NVDA)

NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) preannounced weak Q2 sales. The semiconductor firm reported preliminary Q2 revenue of $6.7 billion, compared to its previous guidance of $8.1 billion. The shortfall was primarily a result of lower-than-expected gaming revenue.
NVDA stock fell, only to snap back subsequently. Hedge funds are betting that the company’s price cuts will re-kindle the demand for its products.
During the pandemic and the cryptocurrency boom, retailers sold Nvidia graphics cards for more than double the suggested retail price. When the pandemic lockdown ended and crypto prices fell, their  prices also slumped.
Hedge funds are betting that Nvidia’s sales will rebound after Q2. Chances are better that the sales will grow after Q1 of 2023, but investors cannot predict how soon the excess supply of Nvidia’s products will be cleared.
Qualcomm (QCOM)

Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) provided Q4 revenue guidance of between $11.0 billion and $11.8 billion. The lower guidance overshadowed its strong Q3 revenue which jumped 37% YOY to $10.9 billion.
On the company’s earnings conference call, CFO Akash Palkhiwala said that elevated uncertainty in the global economy and the impact of anti- Covid measures in China would slow the company’s orders in the second half of 2022. Conversely, the gross margins of Qualcomm’s CDMA technology will increase in the second half. In addition, many handsets will have more of Qualcomm’s processors.
Qualcomm has growth drivers in the 5G market. Although the firm lowered its  5G unit sale guidance, it will increase the average selling price of its 5G products.
Another growth driver for Qualcomm is the radio frequency front-end market. The RF segment is expanding because automotive Internet of Things and Wi-Fi systems need Qualcomm’s RF offerings. Qualcomm has over $900 million of RF front-end design wins with automotive companies.
Patient investors should hold QCOM stock for the long- term.
Uber Technologies (UBER)
Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) posted all-time high gross bookings. of $29.1 billion in Q2, as its gross bookings surged 33% YOY. The ridesharing company’s revenue soared 105% YOY to $8.07 billion.
But Uber lost a massive $2.6 billion in Q2, including a $1.7 billion loss generated by its investments in other firms. However, its Monthly Active Platform Consumers (“MAPCs”) increased a robust 21% YOY to 122 million.
For Q3, Uber expects gross bookings of $29 billion to $30 billion and EBITDA, excluding certain items, of $440 million to $470 million. To meet the guidance, Uber’s investments will have to pay off.
For example, it relaunched its shared ride concept, UberX Share. Past aggressive investments pushed Uber ahead of the competition. Now, however,  its end market is weaker, so Uber must curtail its investments. It will need to leverage its platform advantages to stay ahead of its peers.

2022-08-18 00:00:00+00:00,Wall Street Continues to be Optimistic on Nvidia Stock; Here’s Why,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-street-continues-to-be-optimistic-on-nvidia-stock-heres-why,"Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) pre-announced its Q2 financials that were significantly lower than its previous guidance. Despite the noteworthy reduction in sales and margins, the NVDA stock forecast on TipRanks shows that Wall Street continues to be optimistic about its prospects, given its AI and data center leadership and attractive valuation. 
NVDA Stock: The Worst Is Over!
NVDA announced preliminary Q2 revenue of $6.70 billion compared to its guidance of $8.10 billion. The significant cut reflects lower sell-in of gaming products due to macro headwinds. NVDA’s CEO, Jensen Huang, said, “Our gaming product sell-through projections declined significantly as the quarter progressed.”
While data center revenue improved sequentially and year-over-year, it came somewhat lower than NVDA’s projection due to the supply chain disruptions.
Along with sales, NVDA announced a preliminary adjusted gross margin of 46.1%, drastically lower than its outlook of 67.1%. 
While the shortfall in revenue and margins from the previous outlook is worrying, analysts believe that bad news is already out. Further, the momentum in the data center and NVDA’s AI (Artificial intelligence) capabilities could continue to support its growth. 
In response to NVDA’s weak preliminary Q2 announcement, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill stated that “the street may be buying into the “kitchen sink” narrative,” which implies revealing all the bad news in one go. Gill lowered his near-term estimates but kept his FY24 estimates unchanged. Also, he retained his Buy recommendation on NVDA stock. 
NVDA’s strong balance sheet, attractive valuation, and AI and data center leadership support Gill’s bullish outlook.    
What is the Prediction for Nvidia Stock?
Wall Street analysts are bullish about NVDA stock. It has received 25 Buy and seven Hold recommendations for a Strong Buy rating consensus. Moreover, analysts’ average price target of $235.39 implies 28.4% upside potential. 
While analysts are bullish, hedge funds and insiders have been selling NVDA stock. Hedge funds sold 575.9K NVDA stock in the last quarter. Meanwhile, insiders sold NVDA stock worth $87.9M. Overall, it has a Neutral Smart Score of 4 out of 10 on TipRanks. 
Bottom Line: Near-term headwinds to Play Spoilsport 
NVDA’s long-term fundamentals remain intact. However, near-term weakness in gaming revenues, lower average selling prices, and uncertainty over margins could continue to pose challenges for NVDA stock.

2022-08-23 00:00:00+00:00,Why Things Are Looking Up for Nvidia Before Earnings,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-things-are-looking-up-for-nvidia-before-earnings,"What happened
It's Tuesday afternoon -- still roughly 28 hours to go before semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) reports fiscal second-quarter 2023 earnings. But even before the news has arrived, Nvidia stock is heading higher today.
After rising as much as 2.5% earlier in the day, Nvidia shares are still hanging onto half their gains as of 12:45 p.m. ET -- up 1.3%.
So what
That's actually a bit surprising, seeing as Nvidia already said the earnings news isn't going to be great. If you recall, about two weeks ago Nvidia released a preliminary report on Q2 earnings.
In that report, management warned that its Q2 revenue, which it had previously predicted would amount to $8.1 billion or so, will actually come in closer to $6.7 billion, largely because of a sequential decline in chips sold for video gaming purposes, and slower-than-expected sales of server chips for data centers. Gross profit margin on revenue will also be significantly weaker than investors had been led to expect, coming in closer to 43.7% than to the 65.1% that Nvidia had previously hoped to achieve.
Although Nvidia has taken steps to mitigate the losses, and its operating costs will be slightly smaller than anticipated, the net result of all the above is still probably going to come as a disappointment to investors.
Now what
So why is Nvidia stock up today? That's a great question, but I suspect the answer may be as simple as: bottom-fishing.
Take a look at that chart above again. Since 2022 began, Nvidia stock has been 43% on sale. For that matter, the stock is down nearly 10% over just the past week. Nvidia's sales and earnings tomorrow may not be all that investors had hoped to see -- analysts are forecasting per-share earnings of as little as $0.20 per share, down 79% year over year. But one look at the stock chart is all it takes to tell you that a lot of bad news has already been baked into Nvidia stock's price.
Granted, it's possible not enough bad news has been baked in. But I have to say that, at a P/E ratio of 45 today, and with analysts still forecasting long-term earnings growth rates of 22.5% for Nvidia -- so a 2.0 PEG ratio -- the stock is finally starting to approach a reasonable valuation. If Nvidia reports anything resembling an earnings ""beat"" tomorrow -- and follows that up with something other than abysmal guidance for the rest of the year, there's even a possibility Nvidia stock could pop after earnings.

Now what So why is Nvidia stock up today?",2022,2022-08-23,17.156253814697266,0.2,0.7,0.8,0.9,0.3
2022-08-24 00:00:00+00:00,Durable Goods Orders Remain Unchanged,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/durable-goods-orders-remain-unchanged,"Preliminary Durable Goods Orders for July was weaker than expected on headline — 0.0% (unched) month over month, down from the +1.0% expected — but bring some reassurances upon deeper examination. This follows an upwardly revised +2.2% for June. However, stripping out volatile Transportation costs, this figure blossoms to +0.3%, 10 basis points (bps) higher than the +0.2% expected.
Core Capital Equipment Orders — non-Defense, ex-aircraft: a proxy for “normal” business investment — reached +0.4%, another strong month-over-month number. This follows another upward revision for June: +0.9% from +0.7% originally reported. Shipments came in +0.7%, down 10 bps from the upwardly revised +0.8% the previous month.
While there’s nothing sexy about a 0.0% economic read, it’s actually fairly Goldilocks: the Fed is looking for signs the economy is cooling without crashing too hard, and a zero-balance fits that suit quite well. And coming down from higher revisions to June’s tallies demonstrates stronger pullbacks than expected. That said, these are preliminary figures, subject to change on the final.
After today’s market opens, Pending Home Sales from July are expected to register a negative headline again, but -3% — not nearly the disastrous -8.6% we saw in June. However, let’s be mindful that New Home Sales, reported last week, came in well lower than expectations, -12.6% month over month. Higher mortgage rates and a spike in cancellations, which we saw in Toll Brothers’ TOL earnings report yesterday, are taking a big bite out of the overall housing market.
Brinker International EAT, the parent company of Chili’s and Maggiano’s Little Italy, posted fiscal Q4 earnings results which came in slightly mixed: earnings of $1.15 per share missed the Zacks consensus by a penny, whereas revenues of $1.02 billion beat expectations by +0.42%. But the shares are tumbling -7.7% in today’s pre-market on lowered guidance.
We also have a big afternoon of earnings results after the closing bell today, including semiconductor powerhouse NVIDIA NVDA, cloud software majors salesforce.com CRM and Snowflake SNOW, and upscale specialty retailer Williams-Sonoma WSM, among others.

Aug 25 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq rallied on Thursday, lifted by gains in Nvidia and other technology-related stocks as investors focused on the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole conference for clues about the central bank's policy outlook.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to give a speech on Friday that investors will dissect for indications of how aggressively the Fed may move to raise interest rates as it battles decades-high inflation.
""We're in a period of time between the end of the second-quarter earnings season and meaningful additional data from the Federal Reserve. Markets are churning a bit with a reasonably low level of volatility,"" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.
The yield on the closely watched 10-year Treasury note US10YT=RR faded after recently hitting a two-month high. Declining interest rates tend to benefit technology stocks trading at high valuations.
""Lower interest rates have certainly put some support underneath some of the more growth-oriented sectors,"" Northey said.

Data earlier in the day showed the U.S. economy contracted less than initially thought in the second quarter, dispelling some fears that a recession was underway.

By David French
Aug 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended Friday with all three benchmarks more than 3% lower, as Federal Reserve Chief Jerome Powell's signal that the central bank would keep hiking rates to tame inflation nixed nascent hopes for a more modest path among some investors.
The Nasdaq led declines among the three U.S. benchmarks, registering its worst daily performance since June 16, weighed by high-growth technology stocks which tumbled after rallying the previous day in anticipation of Powell's scheduled speech to the Jackson Hole central banking conference in Wyoming.
The U.S. economy will need tight monetary policy ""for some time"" before inflation is under control, Powell said at the event. That means slower growth, a weaker job market and ""some pain"" for households and businesses, he added.
Investors knew further rate rises were coming, and they have been divided between whether a 75-basis-point and a 50-basis-point hike by the Fed was coming next month.
However, recent data highlighting continued strength in the labor market, to offset two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, had led to some speculating a more tempered pace of hikes could be forthcoming.
""The pushback is coming from the idea that it's not about the pace of hikes going forward and how they tighten financial conditions, it's about the duration of remaining at that restrictive policy stance,"" said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers.
""That's the nuance they are trying to push forward and Powell was, maybe, a bit more explicit in that today. But if you've listened to other Fed speakers in the last couple of weeks, it's the same message.""
With investors repositioning after absorbing the speech, the Cboe Volatility Index .VIX jumped 3.78 points to 25.56, its highest close in six weeks.
All the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, led by declines of between 3.9% and 4.3% in the information technology .SPLRCT, communication services .SPLRCL and consumer discretionary .SPLRCD indexes.
The S&P 500 .SPX lost 141.46 points, or 3.37%, to end at 4,057.66 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC lost 497.56 points, or 3.94%, to 12,141.71. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 1,008.38 points, or 3.03%, to 32,283.40.
High-growth and technology stocks dropped. Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O fell 9.2% and 4.8%, respectively, having led gainers in the previous session. Meanwhile, Google-parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Meta Platforms Inc META.O, and Block Inc SQ.N also dipped between 4.1% and 7.7%.
U.S. stock indexes have retreated since the turn of the year as investors priced in the expectation of aggressive interest rate hikes and a slowing economy.
But they have recovered strongly since June, with the S&P 500 recouping nearly half its losses for the year on stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and hopes decades-high inflation has peaked.
However, Friday's falls wiped out the modest August gains which all three benchmarks had previously carved out, and sent the trio to their second straight week of declines.
For the week, the Nasdaq slid 4.4%, the Dow lost 4.2%, and the S&P 500 fell 4%.
Data earlier showed consumer spending barely rose in July, but inflation eased considerably, which could give the Fed room to trim its aggressive interest rate increases.
Dell Technologies Inc DELL.N fell 13.5% as it joined rivals in predicting a slowdown as inflation and the darkening economic outlook prompt consumers and businesses to tighten their purse strings.
Affirm Holdings Inc AFRM.O tumbled 21.3% after the buy-now-pay-later lender forecast full-year revenue below Wall Street estimates, underscoring the broader downturn in the fortunes of the once high-flying fintech sector.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.37 billion shares, compared with the 10.64 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

2022-08-29 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Didn't Really Have a Bad Quarter,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-didnt-really-have-a-bad-quarter,"For the second quarter of its 2023 fiscal year, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) released a report that appears lackluster on the surface. The company reported revenue growth in the low single digits year over year and showed a dramatic sequential revenue decline.
However, from a more macro point of view, the results may appear different. Given the behavior of the overall industry, Nvidia may have had a good quarter, and investors should consider a more positive perspective.
The nature of the semiconductor market
Semiconductor stocks have one key commonality with the economy -- both operate in cycles. In the case of the chip industry, it bounces between times of surplus and times of shortage.
Rising chip prices lead to foundries investing more heavily in capacity. As supplies rise, prices come down. If producers make too many chips (which usually happens), prices fall, and production slows. This leads to a surplus until demand rises and the cycle begins again.
The pandemic did not make these cycles disappear. Nonetheless, it changed them. For a time, the pandemic led to rising demand as production fell, leading to a severe shortage in some industry sectors.
Sector cycles and Nvidia
Consequently, some sectors have escaped the down effects, and Nvidia's results seem to show this bifurcating chip market. Overall, fiscal second-quarter revenue came in at $6.7 billion. That increased by 3% year over year but fell 19% versus the prior quarter.
Gaming took the most brutal hit on the revenue front amid a return to more offline activities. It brought in $2 billion, dropping 33% versus one year ago and 44% from the first quarter. Likewise, the $496 million in revenue reported in the professional visualization segment fell by 4% from 12 months before and 20% compared with the first quarter.
Nonetheless, the news was very positive in Nvidia's other two segments. Data center, its largest segment with $3.8 billion in revenue, surged 61% quarter over quarter and managed a 1% gain compared with the prior quarter. And despite automotive's modest $220 million in revenue, its registered 45% growth year over year and 59% versus Q1.
Still, the net income picture was bleaker. In Q2 2023, Nvidia earned $656 million, down 51% versus 12 months ago and off 62% from the prior quarter. This occurred as the cost of revenue surged 65%, and operating expenses rose by 36%. So high were the increases that the $181 million tax benefit failed to offset rising costs and expenses.
Also, the third-quarter outlook turned more negative as the company forecast approximately $5.9 billion in revenue. This is 12% less than the previous quarter and would be a 9% yearly decline. Also, as in the current quarter, Nvidia expects the automotive and data center to escape the effects of the down cycle.
Investor reactions
Still, the negative results give some latitude for investors to consider this a good quarter. The market has probably experienced a natural downward movement in the chip cycle, and smart investors seemed to have graded Nvidia's report on a curve. Despite lackluster short-term numbers, the stock rose 4% in Wednesday trading following the report.
Moreover, Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 48 is well above AMD's multiple of 41 and its primary fab, Taiwan Semiconductor, at 17 times earnings. Yet investors may not perceive the stock as expensive since lower profits placed upward pressure on the P/E ratio. Finally, considering that Nvidia stock sells for about half its peak price in late 2021, it may look like a bargain at current levels.

2022-08-31 00:00:00+00:00,U.S. officials order Nvidia to halt sales of top AI chips to China,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-officials-order-nvidia-to-halt-sales-of-top-ai-chips-to-china,"By Stephen Nellis and Jane Lanhee Lee
Aug 31 (Reuters) - Chip designer Nvidia Corp NVDA.O on Wednesday said that U.S. officials told it to stop exporting two top computing chips for artificial intelligence work to China, a move that could cripple Chinese firms' ability to carry out advanced work like image recognition and hamper a business Nvidia expects to generate $400 million in sales this quarter.
Nvidia shares fell 4% after hours. The company said the ban, which affects its A100 and H100 chips designed to speed up machine learning tasks, could interfere with completion of developing the H100, the flagship chip Nvidia announced this year.
Shares of Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices AMD.Owere down 2% after hours. An AMD spokesman told Reuters it had received new license requirements that will stopits MI250 artificial intelligence chips from being exported to China but it believes its MI100 chips will not be affected. AMD said it does not believe the new rules will have a material impact on its business.
Nvidia said U.S. officials told it the new rule ""will address the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a ""military end use"" or ""military end user"" in China.""
The announcement signals a major escalation of the U.S. crackdown on China's technological capabilities as tensions bubble over the fate of Taiwan, where chips for Nvidia and almost every other major chip firm are manufactured.
Without American chips from companies like Nvidia and its rival Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O, Chinese organizations will be unable to cost-effectively carry out the kind of advanced computing used for image and speech recognition, among many other tasks.
Image recognition and natural language processing are common in consumer applications like smartphones that can answer queries and tag photos. They also have military uses such as scouring satellite imagery for weapons or bases and filtering digital communications for intelligence gathering purposes.
AMD did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Nvidia said it had booked $400 million in sales of the affected chips this quarter to China that could be lost if Chinese firms decide not to buy alternative Nvidia products. It said it plans to apply for exemptions to the rule but has ""no assurances"" that U.S. officials will grant them.
Stacy Rasgon, a financial analyst with Bernstein, said the disclosure signaled that about 10% of Nvidia's data center sales, which investors have closely monitored in recent years, were coming from China and that the hit to sales was likely ""manageable"" for Nvidia.
“It’s not (investment) thesis changing, but it’s not a good look,” Rasgon said. “What happens on both sides now is the question,” he said about possible escalations going forward.

2022-09-01 00:00:00+00:00,What's Going On With NVIDIA?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/whats-going-on-with-nvidia,"Semiconductor stocks have lost serious power in 2022 after providing supercharged returns over the last several years.
To put things into perspective, SOXX, the iShares Semiconductor ETF, is down more than 30% year-to-date, vastly underperforming the S&P 500.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
As we can see, it’s been anything but fun for chip stocks in 2022 amid a hawkish Fed and supply-chain disruptions.
An investor favorite, NVIDIA NVDA, has been no exception to the adverse price action, with shares losing more than half of their value YTD and coming nowhere near the general market’s performance.
In fact, the share performance even widely lags a few of its peers, including Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Intel INTC. This is shown in the chart below.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
It raises a valid question, what’s going on with NVIDIA shares to make them perform so poorly relative to other chip stocks? Let’s take a closer look.
Near-Term Outlook Appears Grim
Flipping the pages back a little, NVIDIA shocked the market in early August, providing disheartening guidance that they were forecasting Q2 sales of $6.7 billion vs. the previous $8.1 billion outlook.
This was when the tide started to shift, and the market didn’t react well to the guidance, to say the least – NVDA shares lost nearly 7% the day of.
NVDA reported quarterly sales of $6.7 billion, right at their guidance. The value reflected year-over-year growth of 3% but a sequential decrease of 19%. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Still, why did they initially guide lower? One primary reason included their gaming revenue, which was negatively impacted by macroeconomic headwinds that heavily affected demand.
Fast-forward to today, and the semiconductor titan is back in the headlines following news that the U.S. government will impose a new license requirement for future exports to China. 
It’s a significant development, with NVIDIA stating that it could lose up to $400 million in quarterly revenue as a result, which is obviously not a positive sign.
Is It Time To Buy?
As expected, analysts have substantially pulled back their earnings estimates over the last 60 days, pushing the stock into a Zack Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Investors should target Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks, as they provide much higher odds of investors reaping considerable gains. With NVDA carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), it tells us that its near-term earnings outlook is a bit cloudy and under pressure. 
The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate for the company’s current fiscal year (FY23) resides at $3.48, suggesting a Y/Y decrease of a steep 21%. NVDA’s bottom-line is projected to see some relief in FY24, with the $4.57 per share estimate reflecting year-over-year growth of 31%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
However, the company’s valuation levels have fallen extensively, suggesting that long-term investors could start becoming interested.
NVDA’s forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio has fallen to 12.3X, right at its median of 12.4X over the last five years. Further, the value is 55% off its high of a steep 27.5X in 2021.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Bottom Line
Once seemingly unstoppable investments, chip stocks have fallen from glory in 2022, leaving dents in many portfolios.
A poster-child for the industry, NVIDIA, has recently fallen on tough times, with its earnings outlook shifting negative for the near term amid new licensing requirements and a massive growth slowdown within its gaming segment.
Following the deep sell off, the company’s valuation levels have come down substantially, perhaps intriguing investors with a long-term horizon.
However, it’s vital to recognize that its unfavorable Zacks Rank indicates that more pain could be ahead.
A great strategy would be to wait until NVIDIA’s NVDA earnings outlook strengthens, especially amid the currently cloudy outlook.

2022-09-02 00:00:00+00:00,Bull of the Day: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM),NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bull-of-the-day%3A-taiwan-semiconductor-tsm,"Taiwan Semiconductor TSM is a central player in the manufacture of chips for companies like Apple, NVIDIA, and Marvell.

My colleague Derek Lewis profiled TSM last month and highlighted the company's stunning doubling of revenue in less than 3 years.

This year's topline will ramp a projected 37% to nearly $78 billion, while profits are expected to top $6.30 for 53% growth.

In 2021, Apple AAPL was the largest customer of the Taiwanese semiconductor foundry, aka TSMC, contributing a quarter of the company's revenues.

Why TSM Services Are In High Demand

TSM is known as a ""fab"" or ""foundry"" for chip making. They take the designs of major semiconductor companies and execute their precise -- and top-secret proprietary -- manufacturing parameters.

And this precision and protected privacy has accelerated to new levels in the past few years.

Or maybe I should say it has ""shrunk"" to new levels.

Because Moore's Law about chips doubling in power as they shrink in half every 18 months or so has been reaccelerated after leveling off in the past decade.

This means that chips have entered what I call The Nanosphere.

A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter. And chip micro-circuitry has gone under 10 nanometers in the past few years.

That's why smartphones can do more even as they shrink.

And why NVIDIA NVDA can cram 50 billion transistors into the space of a shoebox for their advanced GPU (graphics processiing unit) cards that stack together for artificial intelligence engines in the DGX system.

This year, Taiwan Semi is helping major chip designers go to 5 nanometers (nm) and even 3nms!

To illustrate the microscopic scale of going sub-10nm, imagine how big the coronavirus might be.

Fact: the coronavirus is around 50 nanometers!

And TSM is the premier foundry for going sub-10nm.

Their only real competition is Samsung.

What if NVDA Stumbles?

Since NVIDIA might be TSM's third or second biggest customer, investors might be concerned about this recent news...

NVDA shares plunged 6.6% in Wednesday’s extended trading session after it revealed that the U.S. government told it to stop exporting top artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China and Russia.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, NVIDIA disclosed that the U.S. government informed it on Aug 26 about imposing a new licensing requirement, effective immediately, for its A100, A100X and forthcoming H100 integrated circuit sales in China and Russia.

The government has also banned NVIDIA from exporting DGX or any other systems that incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.

The new licensing requirements will also be implied on any future chip designs developed by NVIDIA that have a threshold greater than or equivalent to A100. Additionally, any systems developed in the future incorporating the aforementioned types and thresholds will also fall under export restrictions.

With the new licensing requirements, the U.S. government intends to ""address the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a 'military end use' or 'military end user' in China and Russia,"" per NVDA in the SEC filing.

Export Restrictions to Hurt NVIDIA Sales

NVIDIA's A100 and H100 are its highest-performance chips used in data centers for AI, data analytics and computing applications. Though the company does not sell products to customers in Russia, the new licensing requirements are going to significantly hurt its data center chip sales in China.

The newly imposed restrictions are likely to impact the company’s ability to support the existing customers of A100 as well as complete the development of H100 timely. This could also require NVIDIA to transition some of its operations outside China.

The restrictions are expected to hamper NVIDIA’s business in China from where the company is expecting to generate $400 million in revenues from the sale of the aforementioned chips in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The company warned that it may lose revenues if Chinese firms decide not to buy alternative NVIDIA products.

The latest restriction is a new blow to NVIDIA, which is already being hurt by the weakening demand for its chips used in gaming products. Last week, the company reported revenues of $6.7 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, way lower than its May 2022 forecast of $8.10 billion (+/-2%), due to weaker sales across its Gaming and Data Center business segments.

NVIDIA's Gaming segment revenues plunged 33% year over year due to a lower sell-in of Gaming products, reflecting reduced channel partner sales due to macroeconomic headwinds. Although Data Center revenues jumped 61% year over year, the company stated that sales were below expectations due to ongoing supply-chain disruptions and lower sales to China’s hyperscale customers, who are affected by economic conditions.

Considering the current business environment, the company issued dim revenue guidance for the third quarter, wherein it expects to generate $5.9 billion (+/- 2%) in sales, approximately 17% lower than the year-ago quarter’s revenues. Looking at the latest U.S. government’s restriction on chip sales to China, the company is highly probable to report third-quarter revenues way lower than its August 2022 guidance.

Bottom line on TSM: Despite NVDA's downfall, with the SOX index down 35% since its highs and TSM down 43%, it seems the best value in chips right now trading near 13X EPS. Buy some TSM.

2022-09-07 00:00:00+00:00,Which “Strong Buy” Semiconductor Stock Does Wall Street Love Most?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/which-strong-buy-semiconductor-stock-does-wall-street-love-most,"Semiconductor stocks have been dragged lower amid the broader market sell-off. In this piece, we used TipRanks' Comparison Tool to look closely at three discounted semiconductor stocks — AVGO, NVDA, and AAPL — that Wall Street still believes in despite recent negativity.
Semiconductor shortages have been a major cause of concern for most of the pandemic. Such shortages worked their way through most parts of the economy, affecting everything from cars to next-generation video-game consoles.
After the semi shortage could be a glut, as supply gets back up to full speed (or higher than full speed) and demand looks to fade in the early innings of a recession. However, such a semiconductor glut could lead to markdowns and margin erosion in some of the top semiconductor stocks that have been weighed down by seemingly endless headwinds in recent years.
In any case, 2020 and 2021 showed us just how vital the semis are to a proper-functioning world economy. If firms can't get their chips, the supply of many consumer goods falls, adding fuel to price increases.
As the semi boom (and shortage) turns into a bust (and glut), there's no telling how much lower the ""chip dip"" will go on for. Numerous semiconductor makers see weakness. Indeed, economic recessions tend to be quite unforgiving to the cyclical semi plays.
Looking further out, many secular trends in the tech world are still in play. These trends will outlast the coming recession and associated chip bust. From a longer-term perspective, the chip dip seems more than worth buying. Many Wall Street analysts agree.
Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO)
Broadcom is a $202 billion semiconductor behemoth engaged in designing and manufacturing various semiconductor components. The company has been pushing into high-margin software in recent years, thanks in part to strategic acquisitions. Recently, Broadcom bought virtualization software firm VMWare in a deal worth $61 billion.
Many analysts viewed the acquisition favorably, given the modest multiple paid (VMWare stock lost around 53% of its value before Broadcom stepped in). Further, Broadcom has had great success in integrating past software deals, including CA Technologies.
Unlike many tech companies with the urge to merge, Broadcom has been very disciplined in its approach, opting to wait for valuations to come down to reasonable levels before pulling the trigger.
With a growing software presence, Broadcom can become far less cyclical than the semiconductor market. The semiconductor market can be quite cyclical, but software can help hold up the fort. Further, Broadcom's propensity to buy on dips minimizes risks relative to other tech heavyweights that may have been found guilty of chasing.
Recently, Broadcom clocked in a solid third quarter, with per-share earnings of $9.73, above the consensus estimate of $9.56. Revenue also rose 25% year over year to $8.5 billion. Helping fuel the bottom-line beat was strength in Cloud and Data Centers. Though semis face a tough road ahead, Broadcom remains confident for its coming fourth quarter.
At 25.1x trailing earnings, Broadcom stock trades at a slight discount to its peer group. With less-cyclical software offerings to steady the ship, I think AVGO ought to be worth more of a premium in the face of a downturn.
What is AVGO Stock's Price Target?
Wall Street can't get enough of Broadcom, with a ""Strong Buy"" rating and 12 unanimous Buy ratings. The implied year-ahead upside is also quite high, at 33.3%, with the average Broadcom price forecast coming in at $676.36 per share.
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)
Nvidia is a graphics-processing unit (GPU) kingpin that's grown to become one of the most exciting semiconductor plays in the tech scene today. Nvidia's total addressable market (TAM) is huge, and it's growing, with a foot in the door of various nascent tech markets, including AI, connected cars, video gaming, and the metaverse.
Though Nvidia is leaving its rivals behind with every product iteration, the stock has become incredibly frothy in recent years. As semiconductor demand goes from boom to bust, Nvidia stock could see its lofty valuation multiple contract further. Despite shedding more than 59% of its value from its peak, Nvidia stock is still up significantly from its pre-pandemic high.
It's not just a slowing market or a recession that could hit Nvidia stock; new rules surrounding exports of leading AI GPUs to China and Russia could weigh on demand. Nvidia stock got pummelled, as government-mandated export limits will surely take a bite out of sales.
Despite the macro challenges, Nvidia continues to be one of the most innovative forces in Silicon Valley. In due time, its abilities will shine through again. In the meantime, the hefty 12.7x sales multiple, the recent quarterly flop (Q2 2023), and recession woes could be an overhang on the former high-flyer.
What is NVDA Stock's Price Target?
Wall Street thinks the dip in NVDA stock is worth buying, with 23 Buys and eight Holds assigned in the past three months. The average NVDA stock price target of $209.60 suggests 51.8% upside potential over the coming year.
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)
Apple may not be a semiconductor pure-play, but it's made quite a splash in chips over the past few years with its M-series Silicon. Further, Apple is reportedly looking to in-house many other semiconductor components used in its iPhones. According to Bloomberg, one of Apple's new offices may look to create wireless radios and semiconductors used for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity.
Cutting firms like Broadcom out of the equation could do wonders for Apple's margins while giving it more control during times when they are significant constraints on the global semiconductor market. Indeed, semi shortages have weighed on Apple's past quarters. As the company looks to lower its dependence on other chip makers, Apple may be the hardware maker its rivals strive to be.
At the end of the day, Apple is all about finding the perfect balance of hardware, software, and services. The company has done a fantastic job of turning the M-series chip into something special. The product is leaving competing chips for dead. As Apple looks to become the maker of its own components, I'd look for similar performance and power-efficiency improvements across the board.
What is AAPL Stock's Price Target?
Wall Street loves Apple, with 22 Buys, four Holds, and just one Sell. The average AAPL stock price target of $183.12 implies 17.1% year-ahead upside potential.
Conclusion: Analysts are Most Bullish on NVDA Stock
Broadcom, Nvidia, and Apple are chip makers that Wall Street continues to pound the table on. Of the three names on the list, analysts expect the most from Nvidia.

2022-09-08 00:00:00+00:00,Better Semiconductor Stock: AMD vs. Nvidia,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-semiconductor-stock%3A-amd-vs.-nvidia,"Last November, I compared Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and declared that the latter's stronger gaming and data center GPU sales made it a more promising investment than the former. However, Nvidia's stock has declined almost 60% since I wrote that article. AMD stock fared slightly better but was still nearly cut in half.
Both semiconductor stocks were crushed by the post-pandemic slowdown in PC sales and rising interest rates, which drove investors away from higher-growth tech stocks. Plunging cryptocurrency prices exacerbated the pain as frustrated miners gave up and flooded the market with second-hand GPUs.

I clearly underestimated those headwinds last year, but could either of these battered stocks bounce back over the next few quarters? Let's take a fresh look at both chipmakers and see if either stock is worth buying today.
What happened to AMD?
AMD generates most of its revenue from x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs, but it remains the underdog in both markets. It controls 35% of the x86 CPU market, according to PassMark, while Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) holds the remaining 65%. AMD holds a 20% share in the discrete GPU market, according to JPR, while Nvidia still dominates 79% of the market.
Throughout most of AMD's history, it relied on selling cheaper CPUs and GPUs to keep pace with Intel and Nvidia. But under CEO Lisa Su, who took the helm in 2014, AMD started to pull ahead of Intel with smaller, denser, and more power-efficient CPUs. It accomplished this by outsourcing its manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the world's most advanced contract chipmaker, instead of producing them with capital-intensive internal foundries like Intel.
AMD has roughly doubled its market share in CPUs against Intel over the past six years, but it hasn't made meaningful progress in the GPU market against Nvidia, which has repeatedly launched cheaper GeForce cards to keep pace with AMD's Radeon cards in the lower-end gaming market. AMD also carved out a niche by selling custom APUs, which merge together a CPU and GPU, for Microsoft's Xboxes and Sony's PlayStations.
In 2021, AMD's revenue soared 68% to $16.4 billion, its adjusted gross margin expanded 370 basis points to 48.3%, and its adjusted earnings more than doubled. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to grow another 60% and 57%, respectively, this year. But in 2023, they expect AMD's revenue and adjusted earnings to only rise 13% and 12%, respectively, as the PC market cools off. A resurgent Intel, which has been aggressively upgrading its plants to produce more advanced CPUs, could also stir up more competitive headwinds over the next few years.
What happened to Nvidia?
Nvidia generates most of its revenue from gaming and data center GPUs. Both markets fired on all cylinders throughout the pandemic. Its sales of gaming GPUs surged as people stayed at home, played more PC games, and mined more cryptocurrencies. The elevated usage of cloud-based services also boosted sales of its data center GPUs, which are mainly used to process advanced machine learning and AI tasks.
Like AMD, Nvidia outsources the production of its GPUs to leading foundries like TSMC and Samsung. Under its founder and longtime CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia repeatedly held AMD at bay with its more power-efficient chips. AMD's top-tier cards come close to matching Nvidia's in terms of graphical performance, but they generally consume a lot more power.
Nvidia's revenue soared 61% to $26.9 billion in fiscal 2022, which ended this January, as its adjusted gross margin expanded from 65.6% to 66.8%. It usually operates at higher margins than AMD because it sells pricier GPUs and isn't encumbered by AMD's lower-margin CPU and APU sales. Its adjusted earnings jumped 78% for the full year.
But just like AMD, Nvidia faces a near-term slowdown as the PC market cools off. Analysts expect its revenue to rise just 3% this year as its adjusted earnings tumble 24%. Nvidia faces a much rougher landing than AMD because it's much more dependent on the cyclical gaming market, which generated 38% of its revenue in the first half of fiscal 2023. Some of those gaming GPUs are also tethered to the sluggish crypto mining market.
To make matters worse, U.S. regulators recently ordered Nvidia to stop selling its most advanced data center GPUs to China. That ban could reduce Nvidia's revenue by up to $400 million in the current quarter. AMD, which doesn't generate much revenue from high-end data center GPUs, doesn't expect that ban to have a material impact on its business.
The valuations and verdict
AMD's forward price-to-earnings ratio has cooled off to 16, but Nvidia still trades at 40 times forward earnings. AMD also trades at just five times this year's sales, while Nvidia still trades at 12 times this year's sales.
AMD's lower valuations, broader diversification, and softer post-pandemic landing all make it a more compelling buy than Nvidia right now. Nvidia is a solid stock, but it won't be a bargain until its valuations cool off to more sustainable levels.

2022-09-09 00:00:00+00:00,4 Phenomenal Growth Stocks Billionaires Are Buying Hand Over Fist,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-phenomenal-growth-stocks-billionaires-are-buying-hand-over-fist,"This has been an incredibly challenging year for professional and everyday investors alike. It's been 52 years since the benchmark S&P 500 delivered a first-half return as poor as 2022.
However, a bear market for the S&P 500 and tech-centric Nasdaq Composite hasn't kept billionaire fund managers from putting their money to work. Based on 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, billionaires have been piling into innovative growth stocks -- many of which have been some of the hardest-hit names during the bear market downturn.
What follows are four phenomenal growth stocks billionaires have been buying hand over fist as the market plunges.
Image source: Getty Images.
Nvidia
The first supercharged growth stock that at least two billionaire investors can't get enough of is graphics card manufacturer and semiconductor solutions provider Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Form 13F filings show that John Overdeck and David Siegel's Two Sigma Investments purchased nearly 1.27 million shares of Nvidia during the second quarter, ultimately increasing the fund's stake to almost 1.57 million shares.
Overdeck and Siegel's fascination with Nvidia likely has to do with its growing opportunity in data centers and the potential of its ancillary operating segments.
Although Nvidia is probably best known for its graphics cards used in gaming and cryptocurrency mining, the company's data center segment is likely to be its long-term cash cow. Businesses have been shifting data online and into the cloud at an accelerated pace since the COVID-19 pandemic took shape. This has dramatically increased demand for data centers and storage. Nvidia's high-performance data center solutions should enjoy steady growth as the world continues to become more digitally driven.
What's more, Nvidia's solutions are expected to play a key role in the development of the metaverse -- the next iteration of the internet that allows connected users to interact with each other and their environments in 3D virtual worlds. With the exception of the most recent quarter, the company's professional visualization segment has delivered jaw-dropping sales growth as the multitrillion-dollar metaverse takes shape.
Although the next couple of quarters could be a bumpy ride for Nvidia as weaker global growth causes businesses to curtail spending, Overdeck and Siegel appear confident that Nvidia can, once again, outperform.
Vertex Pharmaceuticals
The second phenomenal growth stock billionaires are buying hand over fist is specialty biotech stock Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX). Billionaire Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates gobbled up 187,000 shares of Vertex during the second quarter, which represents about a sixfold increase from Bridgewater's stake at the end of March.
Dalio's affinity for Vertex may have to do with its unique positioning in the cystic fibrosis (CF) space. CF is a genetic disease characterized by thick mucus production that can obstruct a patient's lungs and/or pancreas. It currently has no cure.
Vertex has developed four generations of mutation-specific CF therapies focused on improving patients' lung function. Trikafta, the newest of these treatments, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration five months ahead of its scheduled review date and is pacing nearly $7.6 billion in annual run-rate sales. Thanks to ongoing innovation, Vertex's CF franchise revenue is well protected.
However, the company's pipeline is no slouch either, with more than a half-dozen novel therapies in clinical trials. Having ended June with $9.25 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, Vertex has more than enough capital to fuel internal innovation and encourage collaborative drug development.
In an uncertain environment where Wall Street is desperate for value and innovation, Vertex perfectly fits the mold.

DexCom
A third fast-paced company that billionaires have been piling into is medical-device manufacturer DexCom (NASDAQ: DXCM). The maker of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) was aggressively bought by billionaire Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors during the second quarter. Griffin's fund scooped up almost 1.82 million shares, pushing its stake to roughly 3.07 million shares.
If you're wondering ""Why DexCom?"" given its premium valuation, the answer can be found by looking at the bigger picture. For instance, healthcare stocks are defensive plays. No matter how poorly the U.S. economy and stock market perform, people don't stop requiring prescription drugs, medical devices, and healthcare services. This provides consistent demand and cash flow that healthcare stocks like DexCom can count on.
What's more, DexCom's potential pool of patients continues to grow over time. The latest statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that 37.3 million Americans have diabetes. Another 96 million adults have pre-diabetes, which can turn into diabetes if left untreated. In other words, nearly half the adult population in the U.S. is a potential future client of DexCom.
On a more company-specific level, DexCom also benefits from its razor-and-blades-styled operating model. After selling its generally low-margin CGM device to diabetics (the ""razor""), the company has the opportunity to generate high-margin recurring revenue from selling these users sensors and/or subscriptions (the ""blades"").
DexCom may be pricey on a fundamental basis, but its premium appears well warranted given its competitive advantages and exceptionally long growth runway.
Pinterest
The fourth and final phenomenal growth stock billionaires have been buying hand over fist is social media site Pinterest (NYSE: PINS). Activist investing billionaire Paul Singer of Elliott Management disclosed last month that his fund had become the largest individual shareholder of Pinterest.
Although Wall Street has been critical of Pinterest's declining monthly active user (MAU) count in recent quarters, a wide-lens examination of the company's user count, sans the COVID-19-related pop and drop, shows steady growth over a five-year stretch.
What's far more important for Pinterest has been the company's ability to monetize its existing MAUs, no matter how many there are. Despite a 21-million-MAU decline from the prior-year quarter, the company produced global average revenue per user (ARPU) growth of 17% in the June-ended quarter. International ARPU was even higher. This demonstrates that advertisers are willing to pay a premium to reach Pinterest's 433 million monthly active users.
Something else to note about Pinterest's advertising-driven operating model is that it's not being held hostage by data-tracking software. Since the entire premise of Pinterest's platform is to have users freely and willingly share their interests, the company can deliver this critical data to merchants on a silver platter. This makes it incredibly easy for businesses to target customers on Pinterest's platform and should help the company transition into an e-commerce juggernaut throughout the decade.
If you need one more reason to be confident about Pinterest's future, consider that it's sitting on $2.65 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This is a company that can continue to innovate aggressively without worrying about near-term economic weakness.

2022-09-12 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-Biden to hit China with broader curbs on U.S. chip and tool exports -sources,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-biden-to-hit-china-with-broader-curbs-on-u.s.-chip-and-tool-exports-sources-0,"By Karen Freifeld and Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON, Sept 11(Reuters) - The Biden administration plans next month to broaden curbs on U.S shipments to China of semiconductors used for artificial intelligence and chipmaking tools, several people familiar with the matter said.
The Commerce Department intends to publish new regulations based on restrictions communicated in letters earlier this year to three U.S. companies -- KLA Corp KLAC.O, Lam Research Corp LRCX.O and Applied Materials Inc AMAT.O, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The plan for new rules has not been previously reported.
The letters, which the companies publicly acknowledged, forbade them from exporting chipmaking equipment to Chinese factories that produce advanced semiconductors with sub-14 nanometer processes unless the sellers obtain Commerce Department licenses.
The rules would also codify restrictions in Commerce Department letters sent to Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O last month instructing them to halt shipments of several artificial intelligence computing chips to China unless they obtain licenses.
Some of the sources said the regulations would likely include additional actions against China. The restrictions could also be changed and the rules published later than expected.
So-called ""is informed"" letters allow the Commerce Department to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to put controls in place quickly, but the letters only apply to the companies that receive them.
Turning the letters into rules would broaden their reach and could subject other U.S. companies producing similar technology to the restrictions. The regulations could potentially apply to companies trying to challenge Nvidia and AMD's dominance in artificial intelligence chips.
Intel Corp INTC.O and startups like Cerebras Systems are targeting the same advanced computing markets. Intel said it is closely monitoring the situation, while Cerebras declined to comment.
One source said the rules could also impose license requirements on shipments to China of products that contain the targeted chips. Dell Technologies DELL.N, Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE.N and Super Micro Computer SMCI.O make data center servers that contain Nvidia's A100 chip.
Dell and HPE said they were monitoring the situation, while Super Micro Computer did not respond to a request for comment.
A senior Commerce official declined to comment on the upcoming action, but said: ""As a general rule, we look to codify any restrictions that are in is-informed letters with a regulatory change.""
A spokesperson for the Commerce Department on Friday declined to comment on specific regulations but reiterated that it is ""taking a comprehensive approach to implement additional actions...to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,"" including to keep China from acquiring U.S. technology applicable to military modernization.
KLA, Applied Materials and Nvidia declined to comment while Lam did not respond to requests for comment. AMD did not comment on the specific policy move but reaffirmed it does not foresee a ""material impact"" from its new licensing requirement.
'CHOKE POINT'
The planned action comes as the President Joe Biden's administration has sought to thwart China's advances by targeting technologies where the United States still maintains dominance.
""The strategy is to choke off China and they have discovered that chips are a choke point. They can't make this stuff, they can't make the manufacturing equipment,"" said Jim Lewis a technology expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""That will change.""
In an update on China-related measures last week, the Chamber of Commerce, a U.S. business lobbying group, warned members of imminent restrictions on AI chips and chipmaking tools.
""We are now hearing that members should expect a series of rules or perhaps an overarching rule prior to the mid-term election to codify the guidance in recently issued (Commerce Department) 'is-informed' letters to chip equipment and chip design companies,"" the Chamber said.
The Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The group also said the agency plans to add additional Chinese supercomputing entities to a trade blacklist.
Reuters was first to report in July that the Biden administration was actively discussing banning exports of chipmaking tools to Chinese factories that make advanced semiconductors at the 14 nanometer node and smaller.
U.S. officials have reached out to allies to lobby them to enact similar policies so that foreign companies would not be able to sell technology to China that American firms would be barred from shipping, two of the sources said.
“Coordination with allies is key to maximizing effectiveness and minimizing unintended consequences,"" Clete Willems, a former Trump administration trade official said. ""This should favor broader regulations that others can replicate instead of one-off 'is informed' letters.""

2022-09-13 00:00:00+00:00,3 Best Metaverse Stocks to Buy Now,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-best-metaverse-stocks-to-buy-now,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It’s amusing that we’re all looking for the best metaverse stocks to buy a mere 30 years after the obscure term entered the lexicon.
In 1992, author Neal Stephenson coined the term “metaverse,” which envisioned an immersive digital world that would one day leave its fiction-based origins. Few would’ve predicted that the sci-fi concept would blow up and get massive attention from businesses.
The metaverse is a rapidly evolving industry projected to be worth over $800 billion in the future. Moreover, the best metaverse stocks have distinguished themselves as primary among the hottest financial trends and one of the most talked about investment options on Wall Street.
If you’re curious about this investment option, these picks present the cream of the crop.
The metaverse is a rapidly growing industry projected to be worth nearly $800 billion by 2020. Recently, Citi released an updated report on this topic and projects that it could reach between 8 trillion dollars or more in 2030 if it continues at its current rate. These are the three best metaverse stocks out there today.
NVDA Nvidia  $133.08
U Unity Software $37.04
FB Meta Platforms $154.97
Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is arguably the pick of the metaverse facilitators that should profit from the success of whichever business makes strides in the nascent industry.
Nvidia designs and manufactures cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) that are likely to play a critical role in metaverse development.
Late last year, it rolled out a virtual content creation platform called the Omniverse that facilitates real-time collaboration. It enables designers, creators and engineers to share their material in a digital space effectively. The platform is already gaining healthy traction among users and is set to grow at an incredible pace in the future.
Furthermore, Nvidia operates a fundamentally solid business that continues to prove naysayers wrong. Its revenues and EBITDA have grown by 34.5% and 51.35%, respectively, over the past five years on average.
The success of its legacy business allows the tech giant to continue investing in new growth verticals such as the metaverse. Another encouraging element for investors is that NVDA stock trades well below its five-year averages.
Unity Software (U)

Unity Software (NYSE:U) is a top video game software development business focusing on creating real-time 3D content. It commands over a 60% share in the video game engine market, establishing itself as a clear leader. Unity operates a fundamentally robust business, with double-digit growth across its top and bottom lines.
Long-term forecasts are remarkably positive on the back of the growing adoption of AR and VR technologies, the growth of the video gaming market and its expansion into non-gaming markets. The company has also been investing in its cloud capabilities to transition towards a recurring revenue model.
Its stock price has taken a substantial hit since the beginning of the year due to the broad-based tech sell-off we’ve seen in response to growing inflation and interest rates. However, its results continue to hold firm despite market headwinds.
In its second quarter, over 1,085 customers generated over $100,000 of its sales in the trailing 12 months compared to 888 in the same quarter last year. Also, its dollar-based net expansion rate stayed at an impressive 121%. There are plenty of positives with Unity stock at this time, and the pull-back has created an enticing opening to pick up one of the best metaverse stocks at a great bargain.
Meta Platforms (FB)

The first time most people would’ve heard about the metaverse concept was when Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) to focus its efforts on commercializing the metaverse.
Since the announcement, META stock has shed more than 50% of its value and now trades at multi-year lows. Its core businesses haven’t been firing as well as they would’ve hoped for, which has weighed down its stock further.
Meta still remains committed to the metaverse project, and its top brass is willing to go all-in on what could potentially be a multi-billion dollar industry.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently talked about how the metaverse will likely be a major part of the social media giant’s business in the decade’s second half. He plans to invest a fortune in advancing its metaverse ambitions, which will entail losing a truckload of money over the next several years.
Meta spent a whopping $10 billion in advancing its Reality Labs segment in 2021, which involves developing VR glasses, smart glasses and other pre-release products. Though the business might have to pull back on spending in the interim, it seems clear that this is one of the best metaverse stocks that will become a juggernaut in the metaverse business.

Growth stocks have been having a painful 2022. And with another big Federal Reserve rate hike on the way, the market volatility is likely to continue. However, longer-term investors can seize the opportunity by investing at discounted prices in broader technological trends. One such opportunity is in quantum computing stocks.
Quantum computing aims to reimagine the future of advanced calculations. Historically, computing power has grown at a predictable rate largely constrained by Moore’s Law. This is the observation that as the number of transistors on a semiconductor chip tends to double every two years, the cost of computing drops by half. This has long governed the pace of innovation in the computing industry.
However, we’re hitting physical limits regarding the size of fabrication technologies. To deliver further exponential gains, a new computing technique will be needed. Enter quantum computing. According to Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) fact sheet, “Quantum computers harness the unique behavior of quantum physics — such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference — and apply it to computing.”
If successfully applied at a commercial scale, this new technique could offer breakthroughs in fields as diverse as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, computation chemistry and autonomous driving. Here are seven quantum computing stocks that should stand to benefit.
GOOG, GOOGL Alphabet $105.90, $105.02
NVDA Nvidia $131.67
IBM International Business Machines $128.04
MSFT Microsoft $252.32
RGTI Rigetti $2.43
QBTS D-Wave Quantum $7.86
IONQ IonQ $5.88
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)

Many discussions of quantum computing start with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock. In 2019, Google announced that it had achieved quantum supremacy when its quantum computer Sycamore rapidly calculated a problem that would take existing supercomputers thousands of years to achieve.
This claim has since come under fire. In 2022, Chinese scientists responded, saying they had built a classical computer that could achieve the calculation in a similar period of time and outperform Sycamore. As happens on the cutting edge of science, a great deal of rivalry and competition remains.
In any case, Google’s announcement set off a land rush in the quantum computing space. Google has a unique position in that, if its Sycamore project has increasing success, it can leverage that across a wide variety of other futuristic ventures such as artificial intelligence, healthcare and autonomous driving. It may take a long time for any quantum computing venture to add much to Google’s revenue given how massive the core search and advertising business is by comparison.
However, GOOGL stock is clearly part of the quantum computing conversation.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has its sights on a number of next-generation technology applications. One of these is quantum computing. Nvidia appears to be marketing itself as a picks-and-shovels sort of way to get exposure to the industry.
It can do this via creating quantum simulations. Here’s the company’s explanation: “NVIDIA cuQuantum is an SDK of optimized libraries and tools for accelerating quantum computing workflows. Using NVIDIA GPU Tensor Core GPUs, developers can use cuQuantum to speed up quantum circuit simulations based on state vector and tensor network methods by orders of magnitude.”
NVDA stock has had a rough 2022 so far, with shares losing half their value year to date. Prices for graphics cards are dropping as the backlog from gaming clears up and demand from the cryptocurrency community diminishes. Nvidia could face a rough time into 2023 given the current macroeconomic headwinds. However, its innovations in emerging fields such as quantum computing demonstrate that the company has a lot to look forward to in spite of its present challenges.
International Business Machines (IBM)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been working on developing its own quantum computing systems for quite awhile. And it’s had a significant amount of success to date. Its Hummingbird computing system hits 65 qubits of operating capability in 2020. IBM is aiming to top 1,000 qubits within the next couple of years. The capacity of qubits is a key consideration for when this technology may reach commercial viability.
Investors might be skeptical of IBM’s abilities here. After all, the company has long touted Watson, its artificial intelligence-powered computer system which answers questions posed to it in natural language. Watson has proven adept in winning at games such as chess and Jeopardy, but has not achieved the levels of commercial prominence that IBM stock bulls might have previously hoped.
Will IBM’s quantum computing venture follow a similar path? Only time will tell.
However, IBM retains a highly profitable core business while having one of the most powerful research and development teams in the world. Items such as IBM’s quantum computing arm serve as upside options that could suddenly cause IBM stock to move to higher.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) used to be known for missing several key technological trends, such as smartphones. However, it has gotten much better about leading new movements. The firm’s early and decisive entrance into cloud services with Azure has been exceptionally successful. And now Azure is giving Microsoft a beachhead into quantum computing.
Microsoft is building a quantum ecosystem within Azure. Both through Microsoft’s own internal products and with its partners, Microsoft offers quantum computing solutions to its customers.
This is easier for customers, since they can get access to quantum computing solutions through their existing cloud hosting instead of having to get a physical quantum computer. It also creates immense lock-in for Azure in an increasingly competitive cloud computing industry. Quantum computing is still in its infancy and it remains to be seen exactly how customers will end up using and paying for this technology.
However, Microsoft’s leading position across both office software and cloud computing should naturally transfer to leadership in quantum as well.
Rigetti Computing (RGTI)

The final three quantum computing stocks to buy are pure plays. It should be noted from the top that these are far riskier than the others on the list. These companies have failed to generate meaningful revenues or fully proven their business models yet.
Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI), in particular is one of the main SPACs that recently went to market related to quantum computing. Rigetti claims to have some of the most powerful quantum computing technology out there. And it has impressive research partnerships with organizations such as the U.S. Air Force and the Department of Energy.
Rigetti only generated $8.2 million in revenues in 2021, and is expected to bring in around $12 million this year. The company is likely still years away from generating substantial commercial demand. However, for pureplay quantum computing stocks, Rigetti is one to watch, and shares are certainly discounted after a 75% decline from their initial price.
D-Wave Quantum (QBTS)
Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock
D-Wave Quantum (NYSE:QBTS) is the newest of the quantum computing stocks to come to market. It recently completed its SPAC merger with DPCM Capital. QBTS stock has dipped from $10 to $8 in its first month of trading, giving new investors a discount today.
D-Wave is based in Vancouver and has been in business since 1999. D-Wave Quantum is still in the early stages of monetization, with just $8 million of projected revenues for this year.
However, the company has some strong metrics in other regards. It has more than 200 U.S. patents, 100 scientific published papers, and a top-five overall patent portfolio within the quantum computing space. D-Wave claims to have more than 100 customers and offers the first real-time quantum computing platform. It remains to be seen how successful D-Wave will be. However, as a recent SPAC with a limited trading float, shares could pop on any sort of positive developments.
IonQ (IONQ)

This is by far the most controversial pick on this list. IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) claims to have “the world’s most powerful quantum computer.” Short seller firm Scorpion Capital, however, called the company a “brazen scam” in an exhaustive, 183-page report. For investors that aren’t quantum physicists, it can be hard to evaluate the merits of the company’s technology and the ensuing short-seller claims.
What we do know is that IonQ has generated scant revenues so far. Even by its own admission, there’s a long path ahead before it develops enough qubits to generate substantial commercial demand and finally reach profitability. It’s also been easy for short sellers to go after SPACs with unproven business models. Many of Scorpion’s points about the company’s current financials could be correct without invalidating its entire technology platform.
In any case, IONQ stock remains the single largest holding in the Defiance Quantum ETF (NYSEARCA:QTUM) as of Sept. 12. For investors willing to speculate on a high-risk, high-reward quantum computing stock, IONQ stock is certainly cheaper now than it was a year ago.

2022-09-15 00:00:00+00:00,Tech Sell-Off: 1 Nasdaq Stock Down 61% to Buy Before It Starts Soaring,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tech-sell-off%3A-1-nasdaq-stock-down-61-to-buy-before-it-starts-soaring,"Technology stocks have taken it on the chin this year as investors dumped high-growth companies with equally high valuations. This phenomenon was further compounded by rising interest rates, 40-year-high inflation, and ongoing economic uncertainty. These factors have pushed the Nasdaq Composite into bear market territory, with the widely followed index down roughly 23% from last year's November high.
As much as investors dislike the unending volatility and paper losses such markets bring, the tech sell-off has created some compelling opportunities for investors. Perhaps one of the best examples of that is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company, which supplies graphics processing units (GPUs) used in gaming, cloud computing, data centers, and more, has seen its stock crash more than 61% as of this writing, despite its history of resilient growth.
Can Nvidia overcome the headwinds that have dogged its stock so far this year? Let's look at the big picture for clues.
Shall we play a game?
Like many technology stocks, Nvidia was already reeling, as some investors ""threw out the baby with the bath water,"" so to speak. Things got worse last month when the semiconductor specialist released the results for its fiscal second quarter (ended Jul. 31), which were far worse than expected. Revenue of $6.7 billion grew 3% year over year, dragged down by weakness in its flagship gaming segment, which delivered revenue that tumbled 33% year over year, as consumers reined in spending on Nvidia's high-end processors.
It's important to take a step back, or risk missing the forest for the trees. Nvidia still dominates the discrete desktop GPU market with an 80% share in the second quarter, even stealing additional market share from its rivals. This suggests that once the economy regains its footing, Nvidia's gaming segment will rebound.
Head in the clouds?
Even as Nvidia's gaming segment suffered, its data center segment, which includes processors used in cloud computing, data centers, and artificial intelligence (AI), continued its robust growth. Revenue for the segment grew to $3.81 billion, up 61% year over year and 1% sequentially -- even in the face of macroeconomic headwinds.
Nvidia is the leading provider of processors used in cloud computing, partnering with all the major cloud providers. This includes Amazon Web Services (AWS), Alphabet's Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, as well as Alibaba Cloud, Baidu Cloud, and Tencent Cloud, among many others.
That isn't to say that Nvidia is immune to the challenges facing the broader economy. However, the digital transformation is ongoing and cloud computing has become a necessity for many businesses, rather than a luxury. Storing data in the cloud is cost-effective, improves developer operations, is more secure, and helps businesses to scale and innovate, making it table stakes for companies wanting to compete. Furthermore, it's estimated that the cloud computing market will top $480 billion in 2022, up 18% year over year, growing to more than $1.7 trillion by 2029, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.9%. As one of the most critical components in cloud computing, Nvidia is well-positioned to benefit from this ongoing secular trend.
There are wildcards...
While gaming and cloud computing represent the lion's share of Nvidia's revenue, the company has additional opportunities that are largely untapped. Cloud gaming, which allows players to compete in popular games without buying expensive hardware, is just getting started. Nvidia also has developed dedicated processors for the professional visualization market, which helps designers, creators, engineers, data scientists, and architects develop new 3D tools and content.
Additionally, while some of the initial hype has died down, self-driving cars and trucks still have the potential to change the world. Nvidia has partnered with a veritable who's-who in the autonomous driving space, collaborating with more than 120 car and truck makers, robotaxi services, and tier 1 automotive suppliers, as well as simulation, mapping, sensor, and software companies. This puts Nvidia squarely at the cross roads of this revolutionary technology, once it reaches critical mass.
Finally, there's the company's large and growing opportunity. In fiscal 2022, (ended Jan. 30), Nvidia generated full-year revenue of $26.9 billion, but that pales in comparison to its total addressable market, which management estimates at more than $1 trillion.
What the future holds
A review of the available evidence suggests that the weakness hitting Nvidia's business -- and its stock -- is the result of the prevailing economic headwinds. That means that once the economy is on better footing, it's likely Nvidia will come roaring back.
That's not to say that the stock couldn't fall further -- it certainly could. It's also worth noting that Nvidia isn't cheap in terms of traditional valuation metrics. Even after its recent shellacking, the stock is still trading for 43 times earnings. While that's near its lowest level in years, its still far higher than the Nasdaq's price-to-earnings ratio of 24. However, given the company's history of innovation, industry-leading position, and massive opportunity, I'd argue that the stock is a steal at the current price.
Given what we know, investors should buy Nvidia stock now before it soars.

2022-09-16 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Shares Rose on a Down Day,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-shares-rose-on-a-down-day,"What happened
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have taken it on the chin lately, down 32% in just the past month. But the stock is bucking the trend today, with shares up 1.4% when the technology-filled Nasdaq Composite index was down about 1% as of 3:45 p.m. ET.
So what
Nvidia pre-announced for a disappointing quarter, and it was worse than some investors even thought when it announced results in late August. Shares had dropped on the pre-announcement, but continued to plunge to 52-week lows after its fiscal 2023 second-quarter results were shared for the period ended July 31, 2022. Revenue from the company's gaming segment plunged 33% year over year.
Image source: Getty Images.
Sequentially, sales were down even more from the previous quarter. Overall revenue was down 19% versus the prior quarter, too. But there was more positive news as well, and Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh highlighted more of that side of the business yesterday, helping shares move higher on a generally down day for tech stocks.
Now what
Rakesh lowered his price target on Nvidia yesterday from $225 to $205 per share. Even at the lowered price, Nvidia shares would give investors a 58.5% return from Thursday's closing price. The analyst, not surprisingly, kept the stock at a buy rating based on that potential return, reports The Fly.
Rakesh pointed out that sales to major data center customers in the U.S. look to remain strong through the end of this year. Overall data center sales soared 61% year over year in the most recent quarterly period. At $3.81 billion, those sales represented 57% of Nvidia's business.
Rakesh doesn't think everything is rosy from here, however. He knows macro conditions are not ideal and could get worse. But he believes orders won't be canceled, but rather pushed back instead. Long-term investors won't fret too much if orders are simply delayed and Nvidia's growth path is extended. That seems to be why investors have ticked the stock up on a down market day today.

2022-09-20 00:00:00+00:00,"Nvidia unveils new gaming chip with AI features, taps TSMC for manufacturing",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-unveils-new-gaming-chip-with-ai-features-taps-tsmc-for-manufacturing,"By Stephen Nellis
Sept 20 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp NVDA.O on Tuesday announced new flagship chips for video gamers that use artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance graphics, saying it has tapped Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW to make the processors.
Nvidia has gained attention in recent years with its booming data center business, which sells chips used in artificial intelligence work such as natural language processing. But the company's roots are in graphics chips, which still provided 59% of its $26.9 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year.
In a streamed online keynote address, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang on Tuesday introduced the company's newest ""Ada Lovelace"" series of graphics chips, named for the 19th-century British mathematician regarded as an early pioneer in computer science.
The flagship GeForce RTX 4090 model of the chip will sell for $1,599 and go on sale on Oct. 12. Two less costly RTX 4080 models will start at $899 and $1,199, respectively, and go on sale in November.
Nvidia designs its chips but has them manufactured by partners. Huang said the chips will be made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufaturing (TSMC) with its ""4N"" chip manufacturing technology, a change from Nvidia's previous generation of flagship gaming chips, which were made by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS.
The new Lovelace chips use AI to improve video game graphics. Computing what each pixel on the screen should look like is hard, so Nvidia chips use AI to predict how some pixels should look without doing the entire set of computations. The Lovelace chips have extended that technique to generate entire frames of a game using AI.
In a media briefing, Matt Wuebbling, vice president of global GeForce marketing at Nvidia, said the Lovelace chips will be available for sale globally and are not affected by a recently imposed U.S. ban on selling Nvidia's top data center AI chips to China.
Wuebbling also said the chips will not contain a so-called hash-rate limiter, a technology Nvidia put in its previous generation of chips to limit their use in mining the cryptocurrency Ethereum, because of recent changes in how that currency is tracked.

By David French
Sept 22 (Reuters) - Major Wall Street indexes ended lower on Thursday, falling for a third straight session as investors reacted to the Federal Reserve's latest aggressive move to rein in inflation by selling growth stocks, including technology companies.
The Fed lifted rates by an expected 75 basis points on Wednesday and signaled a longer trajectory for policy rates than markets had priced in, fuelling fears of further volatility in stock and bond trading in a year that has already seen bear markets in both asset classes.
The U.S. central bank's projections for economic growth released on Wednesday were also eye-catching, with growth of just 0.2% this year, rising to 1.2% for 2023.
Jitters were already present in the market after a number of companies - most recently FedEx Corp FDX.N and Ford Motor Co F.N - issued dire outlooks for earnings.
As of Friday, the S&P 500's estimated earnings growth for the third quarter is at 5%, according to Refinitiv data. Excluding the energy sector, the growth rate is at -1.7%.
The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio, a common metric for valuing stocks, is at 16.8 times earnings - far below the nearly 22 times forward P/E that stocks commanded at the start of the year.
Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors fell, led by declines of 2.2% and 1.7%, respectively, in consumer discretionary .SPLRCD and financial .SPSY stocks.
Shares of megacap technology and growth companies such as Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O fell between 1% and 5.3% as benchmark U.S. Treasury yields hit an 11-year high. US/
Rising yields weigh particularly on valuations of companies in the technology sector, which have high expected future earnings and form a significant part of the market-cap weighted indexes such as the S&P 500.
The S&P 500 tech sector .SPLRCT has slumped 28% so far this year, compared with a 21.2% decline in the benchmark index.
""If we continue to have sticky inflation, and if (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell sticks to his guns as he indicates, I think we enter recession and we see significant drawdown on earnings expectations,"" said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets at Boston Partners.
""If this happens, I have high conviction under those conditions that we break 3,636,"" he added, referring to the S&P 500's mid-June low, its weakest point of the year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 107.1 points, or 0.35%, to 30,076.68, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 31.94 points, or 0.84%, to 3,757.99 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 153.39 points, or 1.37%, to 11,066.81.
Major U.S. airlines - which have enjoyed a rebound amid increased travel as pandemic restrictions end - were also down, with United Airlines UAL.O and American Airlines AAL.O falling 4.6% and 3.9% respectively. This took losses in the last three days to 11% for United and 10.6% for American.
JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O, off 7.1% and also recording a third straight loss, closed at its lowest level since March 2020.
Darden Restaurants Inc DRI.N slid 4.4% after the Olive Garden parent reported downbeat first-quarter sales.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.39 billion shares, compared with the 10.91 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 123 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 18 new highs and 699 new lows.

2022-09-23 00:00:00+00:00,My Take: 4 Strong Growth Stocks to Buy This Week,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/my-take%3A-4-strong-growth-stocks-to-buy-this-week-3,"The broad market itself might still be undecided regarding its current direction. A handful of solid stocks, however, just look too beaten-down or too hot to pass up at this point. Here's a closer look at four of these top names to consider soon -- as in this week.
1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
Yes, the semiconductor shortage is still with us. It's not necessarily a problem for every name in the sector, though. For some chip companies, it's been a boon. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) is one of those beneficiaries.
In simplest terms, Taiwan Semiconductor (or TSMC) is a contract chip manufacturer. It makes semiconductors for outfits that design their own but don't want to take on the expense of building their own production foundries. Apple, Qualcomm, and Nvidia are just some of its customers.
And with the chip industry struggling to find enough crucial components, a bunch of key names in the business are increasingly turning to Taiwan Semiconductor for help. That's why this year's top line is projected to grow 30%, driving similar growth in per-share earnings.
It's what's likely to be coming next year, however, that makes this stock such a must-own now. Despite a weakening economy expected to sap chip sales, analysts expect TSMC to keep growing all the same. Needham and Bernstein both see growth for the company in the year ahead, and recently Needham analyst Charles Shi said, ""We believe TSMC's near-monopoly position in 5-nanometer [chips] and 3-nanometer, both of which are expected to ramp meaningfully in 2023, will help the company defy the industry downcycle.""
2. Merck
Merck (NYSE: MRK) wasn't one of the pharmaceutical names swept up in the mania to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. The company makes molnupiravir, which is proving to be a fairly effective treatment for the disease.
Merck opted to maintain most of its focus on its pre-pandemic developments, like expanding the uses of its cancer-fighting Keytruda and continuing its work on a promising pipeline. As an example, its cardiovascular drugs currently in trials could eventually generate $10 billion worth of annual revenue, the company believes. These stories just didn't excite investors in the middle of the pandemic, though. That's why the stock has basically moved sideways since late 2019.
With the fight against COVID-19 losing urgency, however, the market's focus could readily turn back to longer-lived drug opportunities. And Merck has plenty of them.
Beyond cardiovascular drugs, the company's anticoagulant MK-2060 was recently granted a fast-track designation from the Food and Drug Administration, and Merck is now collaborating with Orna Therapeutics on RNA-based therapies.
These and other efforts haven't stoked the stock's fires yet. If the economy and overall market continue weakening, though, the sort of resiliency Merck can offer (not to mention its current dividend yield of 3.1%) becomes quite compelling.
3. Amazon
It's been a fairly poor year for the overall market, and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been no exception. In fact, given Amazon's massive market cap, this year's marketwide weakness can largely be attributed to the company's 26% year-to-date slide. Sky-high gas prices and soaring employee costs have taken a big bite out of the company's already paper-thin profit margins on its e-commerce operation, and investors are pricing the pain in.
What's largely being overlooked right now is that e-commerce hasn't been Amazon's breadwinner for a long, long time. That honor belongs to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Even in pre-pandemic fiscal 2019, AWS accounted for two-thirds of Amazon's operating income. And the cloud computing arm's bottom line is nearly twice as big now as it was then, with more of the same sort of growth in the cards.
In the meantime, while Amazon is losing money right now by selling physical goods online, it's mattering less and less. The company generated a whopping $31 billion in high-margin ad revenue last year, finding a new way to leverage the massive amount of traffic that its online marketplace draws every day. So this year's top line is expected to grow 11% before accelerating to a growth pace of more than 15% next year.
The company can afford for its e-commerce operation to lose money when it's making so much more in other ways.
4. Genuine Parts Company
Lastly, add auto parts retailer Genuine Parts Company (NYSE: GPC) to your list of growth stocks to buy this week.
It's an interesting industry. Whereas consumers might skip a trip to the mall or postpone a vacation when it feels like money is getting tight or jobs are in jeopardy, car repairs are rarely optional. Not even the pandemic stifled demand for car parts.
Genuine Parts Company (you might know it better as NAPA Auto Parts) managed to do almost as much business in a challenging 2020 as it did in 2019, and then managed to pump up its top line by 14% in 2021. Operating profits remained solid during that trying time as well. Sales are on pace to improve 14% this year, once again pumping up its profits to a similar degree. It's a testament to the fact that for most consumers, car repairs can't wait.
And that's increasingly so. Thanks to a combination of inflation and broken supply chains, Kelley Blue Book reports the average price of a new car in the United States reached a record-breaking $48,300 last month...assuming you can find one you like. Between the cost and sheer scarcity of attractive used cars, a bunch of people are willing to spend good money just to keep their current cars running for as long as possible.
The kicker: Genuine Parts Company currently pays a dividend of 2.3%. It has paid a dividend every quarter for decades, and has raised it every year for the past 66 years.

2022-09-26 00:00:00+00:00,The 3 Most Undervalued Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy Now,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-3-most-undervalued-quantum-computing-stocks-to-buy-now,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Quantum computing is an emerging technology that has great potential to revolutionize businesses in various industries. These advanced machines can solve complex problems faster than traditional computers, making them well-suited for weather forecasting, financial modeling, and material science research tasks. Therefore, undervalued quantum computing stocks are great for investors who want to stay ahead of the curve.
There are many different quantum computing stocks to choose from, so it’s important to do your research before making a purchase. When investing in quantum computing stocks, you should consider the company’s financial stability, plans, and competitive landscape.
In selecting undervalued quantum computing stocks for this list, the focus is on companies with diversified business streams but have not been doing too well this year because of the bearishness of the markets. All three stocks are down more than 30% this year, making them attractively valued for the aggressive investor.
Without waiting any longer, here are three undervalued quantum computing stocks that you should consider investing in:
NVDA Nvidia $122.79
TSM Taiwan Semiconductor $73.24
BABA Alibaba $77.98
Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is best known for its range of graphics cards, which are used in everything from gaming computers to cryptocurrency mining rigs. However, the company is also working in the quantum computing space.
Nvidia offers software tools to make it easier for developers to create applications that run on quantum computers. Nvidia’s cuQuantum SDK provides a collection of libraries, tools, and programming challenges that enable users to develop quantum algorithms and applications on Nvidia GPUs. The company’s experience in hardware and software makes it well-positioned to become a major player in the quantum computing space.
To pursue its quantum computing ambitions, Nvidia has joined hands with International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Google AI, and others on this project who share these ambitions for quantum computing advancements. The partnerships underscore the company’s commitment to delivering powerful quantum computing solutions to help researchers solve some of the world’s most challenging problems.
Nvidia stock was a hot topic during the pandemic. Sales rose rapidly due to people buying computer parts to work from home. This helped contribute to Nvidia’s 61% jump in revenue in its latest fiscal year. However, this year is different. Nvidia has been suffering recently as sales for graphic cards declined due to tough economic times.
The stock has dropped more than 50% this year so far. But as a value investor, Nvidia is one of the best undervalued quantum computing stocks. It has a wide moat and strong prospects, meaning investors need not worry if it pours capital extensively into quantum computing.
Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)

Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s biggest contract chipmaker and one of Taiwan’s most important companies. It is also a few firms that manufacture chips using the most advanced process technologies.
The company is now the largest foundry in the world, with a market share of over 53%. It manufactures chips for some of the biggest names in the industry, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Nvidia. TSMC has been instrumental in Taiwan’s transformation from a poor agricultural country to a major high-tech powerhouse. The company is a symbol of Taiwan’s economic success and global competitiveness.
To help Taiwan remain competitive in the emerging quantum computing market, TSMC has partnered with Taiwan’s science ministry. Together, they hope to create a quantum cloud computing platform that will open to businesses and researchers worldwide. The platform will use TSMC’s advanced chip-making technology and the science ministry’s expertise in quantum information processing.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is doing well financially, with everything going according to plan. In the second quarter of the year, the world’s biggest chipmaker posted a record net profit and a rise of 43.5% year on year. Both figures handily surpassed analyst estimates. TSMC’s third quarter revenue is projected to be between $19.8 billion and $20.6 billion, up from last year’s figure of $14.8 billion.
Such a solid financial platform means the company can pursue its quantum computing issues without upsetting the boat. Shares are down over 40% this year.

Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), the Chinese e-commerce giant, has come under pressure in recent months due to increased regulatory activity. Last year, the company was fined a record $2.8 billion by Chinese regulators for violations of anti-monopoly laws. Alibaba is also being examined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its accounting practices.
Under usual circumstances, investing in BABA shares is an easy decision. However, the e-commerce giant is in trouble because of the regulatory activity in both the U.S. and China, a slowdown in the economy, and Covid lockdowns. This led to a perfect storm, which resulted in Alibaba’s first quarterly revenue drop since 2014.
However, China’s e-commerce behemoth is looking to shake things up by investing in several innovative new business areas. These include quantum computing, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality. Quantum computing, in particular, is not a new area of investment for Alibaba.
Back in 2018, Alibaba’s cloud computing segment launched a superconducting quantum computing service in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The quantum computer offers 11 quantum bits of speed. It can support various use cases and is available to all Alibaba Cloud users.
As quantum computing technology becomes more advanced, it will have a greater impact in the future. Alibaba will use this technology to build its future and drive profitability moving forward.

2022-09-28 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia Stock Has Grown 2.5x In Less Than Five Years- Here's Why,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-has-grown-2.5x-in-less-than-five-years-heres-why,"Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock price rose more than 2.5x from $48 in 2017 end to around $125 currently, primarily due to favorable changes in its sales. During this period, the company witnessed a strong 206% rise in revenues, and despite a 19% drop in its P/S multiple and a 5.4% rise in the outstanding share count, the company’s stock price has rallied. Further, over the same period, the S&P 500 returned around 40%, meaning that NVDA stock has managed to strongly beat the index since 2017-end.
In our interactive dashboard, Why Nvidia Stock Moved: NVDA Stock Has Gained 159% Since 2017, we break down the factors behind this move.
(A) NVDA’s Total Revenue has grown 206% from $9.7 billion in FY 2018 to $29.7 billion on an LTM basis
NVDA’s total revenue hovered between $10 billion to $12 billion from FY ’18 to FY ’20, but demand has picked up since the pandemic and sales have risen strongly to $26.9 billion in FY ’22, and currently stand even higher at $29.7 billion (NVDA’s fiscal year ends in January).
Nvidia is a major player in the GPU market, with its sales being driven by gaming processors and data centers.
Nvidia’s largest segment is the graphics segment, bringing in $15.9 billion as of FY ’22, making up around 59% of the company’s total sales.
For additional details about NVDA’s revenues and comparison to peers, see Nvidia (NVDA) Revenue Comparison
(B) Revenue per share (RPS) increased 191% from $4.06 in FY 2018 to $11.79 currently
NVDA’s revenue rose from $9.7 billion in FY 2018 to $29.7 billion currently, while the outstanding share count rose from 2.4 billion in FY 2018 to around 2.5 billion currently.
Due to this, RPS has jumped almost 3x from $4.06 in FY ’18 to $11.79 currently.
(C) Price-To-Sales (P/S) multiple for NVDA rose strongly from 13.1x in 2017 to 46.4x by 2021 end, but has pulled back to 10.6x currently, lower than its 2017 level
NVDA’s P/S multiple rose strongly to around 46.4x by late 2021, on the back of rising investor expectations surrounding increased demand for its graphic processors, leading to a rise in the company’s sales.
However, due to the current geopolitical tensions and increased economic uncertainty weighing on the broader markets, the P/S multiple has pulled back, currently standing at around 10.6x.

2022-09-29 00:00:00+00:00,Relative Strength Alert For NVIDIA,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/relative-strength-alert-for-nvidia,"Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.
In trading on Thursday, shares of NVIDIA Corp (Symbol: NVDA) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 27.0, after changing hands as low as $120.35 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 27.5. A bullish investor could look at NVDA's 27.0 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of NVDA shares:
Looking at the chart above, NVDA's low point in its 52 week range is $120.35 per share, with $346.47 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $121.35.

2022-09-30 00:00:00+00:00,"Trouble Mounts for Chipmakers, More Pain Ahead",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trouble-mounts-for-chipmakers-more-pain-ahead,"Shares of chipmakers that went through the roof amid the pandemic have erased most of their gains. A moderation in consumer demand took a toll on their financials and stock price. For instance, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are down about 58%, 55%, and 48%, year-to-date.
While shares of these chipmakers have declined quite a lot, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland sees more pain ahead and lowered his price target on these stocks. 
Rolland stated that his channel checks indicate that “PC market weakness may be extending beyond consumer and into enterprise as we now forecast ODM [original design manufacturer] builds to decline -20% YOY and PC shipments to decline -17% YOY (287M units and perhaps lower).”
The analyst added, “Retail GPU [graphics processing unit], pricing has fallen below MSRPs [manufacturer’s suggested retail price], high-end GPU retail prices as much as -30% below MSRP, and eBay sales more than -40% below MSRP.”
The slower demand and lower average selling prices will hurt the revenue and margins of these chipmakers. Further, the U.S. government’s strict license requirement for exports to China remains a drag. Amid challenges, let’s see what’s in store for NVDA, AMD, and INTC.
Is Nvidia a Good Stock to Buy?
Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about Nvidia stock as near-term headwinds act as a dampener. It has received 24 Buy and nine Hold recommendations for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Meanwhile, NVDA’s average price target of $206.81 implies 69.2% upside potential.
NVDA stock has a negative signal from hedge fund managers, who sold 415.8K shares last quarter. Meanwhile, NVDA stock has a Neutral Smart Score of six out of 10. 
What is AMD Stock Prediction?
AMD’s fundamentals remain strong. However, weakening consumer GPU trends and macro challenges keep analysts cautiously optimistic about Advanced Micro Devices stock. It commands a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TipRanks based on 19 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell. 
Further, these analysts’ average price target of $118.13 implies 84.2% upside potential.
AMD stock has a positive signal from hedge fund managers, who bought 1.3M shares last quarter. However, insiders sold AMD stock worth $4.1M. Overall, AMD stock has a Neutral Smart Score of seven out of 10 on TipRanks.
Is Intel a Buy, Sell, or Hold?
The new ARC A770 GPU and 13th-generation desktop processor launch will support Intel stock. However, the weakness across the industry poses challenges. INTC stock has a Hold consensus rating on TipRanks based on four Buy, 16 Hold, and eight Sell recommendations. Meanwhile, INTC’s average price target of $38.05 implies 44.2% upside potential.
INTC stock has a negative indicator from hedge fund managers, who sold 1.3M INTC shares last quarter. However, insiders acquired Intel stock worth $501.1K. Overall, INTC has a Neutral Smart Score of six out of 10.

2022-10-03 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Nvidia, Shopify, and Roku Stocks Popped on Monday",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-shopify-and-roku-stocks-popped-on-monday,"What happened
A broad cross-section of stocks rallied on Monday, recovering from last week's drubbing and buoyed by a manufacturing report that suggests inflation may be slowing.
With that as a backdrop, a number of technology stocks outpaced the broader market indexes. Shares of e-commerce platform provider Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) rose as much as 3.2%, semiconductor specialist Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) jumped as much as 3.7%, and streaming video pioneer Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) surged as much as 4.3%. As of 2:50 p.m. ET, the trio were still trading higher, gaining 1.6%, 2.7%, and 4.1%, respectively. These stocks followed the broader market higher, as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.9% and 1.7%, respectively.
There was no company-specific news driving the gains, but shares of these companies have been punished over the past year, so investors were using any positive news to look for bargains among the rubble. The latest report on manufacturing data provided investors with the excuse they were looking for to buy shares of beaten-down technology stocks.
So what
A report by the not-for-profit Institute for Supply Management revealed that manufacturing activity declined again during September. The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) came in at 50.9%, down from 52.8% in August. It's important to note that any figure above 50% suggests expansion in the overall manufacturing economy, albeit at a slower rate. This came in below economists' consensus estimates of 52.3%, but represents the 28th consecutive month of growth, after the economy contracted during April and May, 2020, according to the report.
Another metric in the report, the prices index -- which measures prices paid -- declined for the sixth straight month. This suggests that inflation may be easing, as manufacturers are paying less for component parts.
Now what
It's worth noting that a check of all the usual sources shows there haven't been any recent regulatory filings, earnings reports, or specific business developments for the trio of companies, so they appear to be following the broader market higher.
So what does the manufacturing report have to do with technology stocks? It isn't so much the report itself, though the fact that manufacturing activity hasn't fallen into contraction territory is a positive development. Wall Street took the suggestion that inflation may be easing as good news.
The Federal Reserve Bank has left no question that it will continue to fight rising inflation with an aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes. The most recent increase came in late September, as the Fed bumped interest rates up by 0.75%, the third such increase since June and the fifth rate hike so far this year. The federal funds rate now stands in a range of between 3% and 3.25%, its highest level since 2008.
Each of these stocks has been negatively affected by runaway inflation. With everything costing more, consumers have been cutting back where they can. Gamers are buying fewer high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia, consumers are cutting back on e-commerce transactions impacting Shopify, and streaming account growth has slowed at Roku. Inflation may finally be easing, which in turn would cause the Fed to stop -- or at least slow -- its campaign of rising interest rates. These would both be positive developments for the economy, which is buoying the market and these technology stocks.
The recent stock market plunge has resulted in a rare opportunity to get these growth stocks at a discount. That isn't to say that they won't fall lower -- they certainly might. However, each of these stocks is currently trading at or near multiyear-low valuations, making them as cheap as they've been in years.
Nvidia, Shopify, and Roku stocks are currently selling at 10 times, five times, and two times next year's sales, when a reasonable price-to-sales ratio is between 1 and 2. For investors looking three to five years into the future, buying shares in these top-notch companies while their valuations are near historic low valuations will seem like a brilliant move.

  Welcome to Episode #331 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.
Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.
This week, Tracey is joined by Zacks Senior Strategist, Kevin Cook, to discuss their favorite topic: what should investors do as stocks sell-off?
Should you sell? Or add further to your positions?
What do you do with growth stocks? Do you sell your FANGMAN stocks, which are down anywhere from 10% to 50% from their highs?
Or do you do…nothing?
Exxon’s Market Cap Overtakes Meta Platforms
This year, for the first time in 5 years, ExxonMobil’s XOM market cap has exceeded Meta Platforms META, one of the FANGMAN stocks.
Meta Platforms shares have fallen 18.5% over the last 5 years as shares have plunged this year.
But ExxonMobil shares are now up 16% over the last 5 years after gaining 56% this year.
ExxonMobil has been a value stock for years. Meta Platforms was a growth stock, often listed among the top stocks as one of the “FANGMANs.”
Is the tide turning in favor of value?
[As we talk about in the podcast, Kevin is reading the May 2022 book called Fossil Future by Alex Epstein. Tracey promised to link to it. You can find it on Amazon here.]
What’s Working and What’s Not
In addition to energy, investors have been fleeing to healthcare stocks for safety. Should you follow?
And they have been selling the big tech names, especially the semiconductors. Are the semi stocks oversold?
1.       UnitedHealth Group UNH
UnitedHealth Group has been holding up during the 2022 sell-off. Shares are up 4.2% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is down 22.8%.
Over the last 5 years, UnitedHealth Group shares are up 164% compared to just 48.7% for the S&P 500.
UnitedHealth Group isn’t cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 23.6.
It also pays a dividend, but it is only yielding 1.3%.
Is it too late to hide out in UnitedHealth Group?
2.       Biogen BIIB
Biogen shares popped 37% recently after it announced its Alzheimer’s drug reduced cognitive decline by 27% compared to the placebo.
Shares of Biogen are up 11.5% year-to-date.
Biogen isn’t that expensive, with a forward P/E of 16.1. It does not, however, pay a dividend.
Should investors be buying Biogen after the big pop?
3.       NVIDIA NVDA
NVIDIA is one of the big winners of the “FANGMAN” stocks. Over the last 5 years, NVIDIA has gained 190%.
But NVIDIA shares have taken a big dive in 2022, falling 55.2%.
Shares of NVIDIA are still expensive at 35x. It now has a Zacks Rank of 5 (Strong Sell).
NVIDIA has been one of Kevin’s favorite stocks. Is he buying it here on weakness?

2022-10-06 00:00:00+00:00,The Curious Reason Why Nvidia Stock Gained Ground Thursday Morning,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-curious-reason-why-nvidia-stock-gained-ground-thursday-morning,"What happened
Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) climbed higher Thursday morning, jumping by as much as 3.4%. As of 1:25 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 0.8% -- even as the three major U.S. indexes lost ground.
The catalyst that sent the semiconductor specialist higher was news that the U.S. will further limit the export of certain types of high-end chips to China.
So what
The Biden administration is expected to announce new restrictions preventing the most cutting-edge semiconductors -- and the technology needed to fabricate such chips -- from being sold to China, according to a Wall Street Journal article citing ""people familiar with the situation.""
This move is intended to curb the flow of U.S. processor technology to China, particularly when it comes to high-end chips used in military systems, artificial intelligence (AI) technology, and data processing. The rules could ultimately place additional limitations on the sale of cutting-edge processors to China and Russia. While the move could limit competition from foreign manufacturers, it could also cut into U.S. companies' semiconductor sales, so it's difficult to calculate the overall impact of the new policies.
Now what
This is the latest chapter in an ongoing saga as the U.S. government and its allies work to keep place stricter controls on sensitive technology.
The recently passed Chips and Science Act of 2022 should provide some relief that will counter the potential negative impact on U.S. companies from these added regulations. The Act provides roughly $53 billion in financial assistance to increase domestic semiconductor manufacturing, as well as $24 billion in tax breaks and other incentives. The Commerce Department is expected to soon begin doling out these funds in the form of factory-building grants, research funding, and tax breaks to help encourage domestic production, according to the article.
Early last month, Nvidia announced in a regulatory filing that the U.S. had imposed new licensing requirements on its high-end A 100 and H100 tensor core graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used in AI applications and data centers -- as well as any integrated systems that use the processors -- restricting their exports to China, Hong Kong, and Russia. At the time, Nvidia said the new limitations were expected to affect roughly $400 million in potential sales.

U.S. adds more-than-expected jobs in September
U.S. unemployment rate falls to 3.5%

Technology leads sectoral declines on S&P 500
Indexes: Dow 1.63%, S&P 2.14%, Nasdaq 2.80%

By Shreyashi Sanyal and Ankika Biswas
Oct 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street slid on Friday as solid job growth and a drop in the unemployment rate last month gave more room for the Federal Reserve to stick to jumbo-sized interest rate hikes, while a revenue warning from Advanced Micro Devices hit chipmakers.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 263,000 jobs last month after rising 315,000 in August.
The report also showed the jobless rate fell to 3.5% in September, lower than expectations of 3.7%. Traders now see a 92% chance of 75 basis-point hike by the Fed, up from 83.4% before data.
Aggressive rise in borrowing costs have stoked fears of slowing economic growth and a hit to corporate profits, but with the labor market remaining tight, the Fed was likely to continue with its monetary tightening plan.
""The markets are worried that the Fed is going to rely on information like this that's really a month old and they're going to overshoot and kill the economy,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.
""Investors don't have confidence in a soft landing because the Fed continues to have to ramp higher and higher to begin to slow the economy down.""
The Philadelphia Semiconductor SE index .SOX shed 4.2%, and was set for its biggest one-day percentage decline in nearly a month as a revenue warning from Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O signaled the chip slump could be worse than expected.
AMD fell 7.97% as its third-quarter revenue estimates were about a billion dollars less than previously forecast.
Peers Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Intel Corp INTC.O, ON Semiconductors ON.O, Lam Research LRCX.O, and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O shed between 2.65% and 4.88%.
""People who had been hoping for some kind of turnaround in the chips are starting to give up that hope,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.
The S&P 500 technology sector .SPLRCT index fell 3.1%, leading declines among the 11 major sector indexes.
At 10:02 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 488.84 points, or 1.63%, at 29,438.10, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 80.05 points, or 2.14%, at 3,664.47, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 309.86 points, or 2.80%, at 10,763.45.
All three main Wall Street indexes are still set to snap a three-week losing streak, heading for their biggest weekly gain in almost a month.
With the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR rising to 3.8875%, most rate-sensitive technology and growth stocks such as Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O fell between 2.25% and 3.92%.US/
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 7.75-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 4.70-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded two new 52-week highs and 49 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 12 new highs and 148 new lows.

Multiple growth stocks have been hit hard in 2022 as many are key players in the tech industry.
Companies such as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) have suffered significant declines in their share prices since January as inflation increases have led to reduced consumer spending and investors slowly backing away from the affected companies.
However, each of these companies continues to be a dominating presence in its respective industry and has seen substantial growth in revenue over the last three years, as can be seen in the table below.

These three top-growing stocks have a history of growth over the years and are likely to provide significant gains for investors willing to wait. Let's have a look.
Netflix
This streaming titan has seen exponential growth since its online-video platform launched in 2007. Its annual revenue grew at an average growth rate of 28%.
However, Netflix has had a rough 2022. Its stock has dipped 62% since January on the back of losing over 1 million subscribers in its first two quarters. However, the company projects a gain of 1 million new members in Q3 2022, which could end its subscriber declines.
Moreover, Netflix will launch its ad-supported tier in November, providing a more budget-friendly subscription option that is likely to boost revenue. On Sept. 15, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney upgraded Netflix's stock to buy. He also projected the ad tier will bring in about $2 billion in incremental revenue by 2024, with another $500 million to $1 million of incremental growth generated from crackdowns on password sharing.
With the addition of advertising revenue, restrictions on password sharing, and Netlfix's recent venture into gaming, the company is likely to continue growing for years to come.
Alphabet
As one of the fastest-growing companies in the world, Alphabet has revolutionized multiple aspects of the tech industry. The company is home to potent brands such as Android, Chrome, YouTube, and Google, which each have a substantial market share in their corresponding industries. Alphabet's dominance in markets such as search engines, smartphone operating systems, online-video sharing, and internet browsers has helped it become a digital-advertising star.
The company has retained a leading position in digital advertising since at least 2016, with a 28% share in 2022. In fact, nearly 93% of the company's $69.6 billion revenue came from ads in the second quarter of 2022, when combining Google and YouTube's advertising earnings.
As a result, investors have grown concerned that if inflation keeps rising, companies might slash their advertising budgets, equally slashing Alphabet's revenue. However, according to market research firm Insider Intelligence, U.S. digital ad spending is expected to rise 31% from $239.89 billion in 2022 to $315.52 billion in 2025.
Additionally, companies like Netflix and Disney are increasingly turning to ads to reduce subscription fees for budget-conscious consumers. Other subscription-based businesses could turn to Alphabet's Google Network to supplement a reduced membership price with ads.
Nvidia
Nvidia has been one of the hardest-hit stocks in 2022, down almost 60% year to date. The company is a leader in graphic processing units (GPUs), responsible for 95% of the market. The company's GPUs power gaming PCs around the world and played a crucial role in the crypto-mining market.
As a result, this year has been a perfect storm for Nvidia as slumps in the PC market and changes to how the cryptocurrency Ethereum is produced decreased demand for GPUs.
Despite a rough year, the company's outlook is positive. Nvidia has made a name for itself in the gaming community, and its expansion into artificial intelligence (AI) is very promising. The company's chips are critical components in the machines responsible for handling more than 90% of all AI workloads in data centers worldwide. Furthermore, according to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to expand at a compound annual rate of 38.1% from 2022 to 2030.
The GPU market may be down this year, but the device remains a crucial component in millions of PCs worldwide. Demand won't be down forever, with Nvidia's data center business likely to continue expanding. Its data center business was responsible for 56% of Nvidia's revenue in the latest quarter, with the segment seeing a 60% increase year over year.
Nvidia is a fast-growing company and an excellent buy for investors in it for the long haul.

Oct 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks crept higher on Wednesday, struggling through fresh concerns over rising inflation and borrowing costs following a surprise rise in September producer prices and ahead of minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting.
The Labor Department's producer prices index rose 8.5% in the 12 months through September, slightly higher than an estimated 8.4% rise. The reading was still lower than an 8.7% increase in August.
After five days of selloff, the S&P 500 .SPX and the Nasdaq .IXIC were trading higher even though there are mounting fears that aggressive rate hikes by the Fed could tip the world's largest economy into a recession.
""It's stubborn and some people are hoping that we had peak inflation and it's going to come down quickly,"" said Joe Saluzzi, partner at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.
""It is not going to be that way. That's what the Fed has been looking at and that's why they're raising rates the way they are. This will take time and this is not going to be a quick thing.""
In the afternoon, investors will scrutinize the Fed's September meeting minutes for more clarity on the central bank's rate hike trajectory. Money markets are pricing in a 92% chance of another 75-basis-point hike in November. FEDWATCH
""The thing we're looking for from the FOMC is some evidence that it is open-minded, that they will consider being a lot more flexible,"" said Hugh Johnson, chief economist of Hugh Johnson Economics at Albany, New York.
""The comments are going to be just as hawkish as they have been.""
Investors also await the highly-anticipated consumer prices report on Thursday, which is expected to have picked up in September.
At 12:35 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 108.35 points, or 0.37%, at 29,347.54, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 4.96 points, or 0.14%, at 3,593.80, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 3.87 points, or 0.04%, at 10,430.06.

The United States is scrambling to tackle unintended consequences of its new export curbs on China's chip industry that could inadvertently harm the semiconductor supply chain.
The Biden administration has allowed at least two non-Chinese chipmakers operating in China to receive restricted goods and services without their suppliers seeking licenses, the report said.
PepsiCo Inc PEP.O gained 4.45% after the soft-drinks maker raised its annual revenue and profit forecasts on firm demand for its sodas and snacks despite multiple price increases.
Boeing Co BA.N slipped 1.84% after Credit Suisse started its coverage on the planemaker with an ""underperform"" rating and Street low price target.
Aluminum producer Alcoa Corp AA.N inched up 2.11% following a media report that the United States is considering a complete ban on Russian aluminum in response to Moscow's military escalation in Ukraine.

2022-10-13 00:00:00+00:00,Is Nvidia Stock a Buy Now?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-nvidia-stock-a-buy-now-6,"Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) took a big beating on the stock market on Friday last week, falling over 8% after rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) released its preliminary revenue for the third quarter of 2022.
AMD's third-quarter revenue estimate missed the company's original forecast of $6.7 billion issued in August by a wide margin. The announcement sent alarm bells ringing in the semiconductor space, and Nvidia stock bore the brunt of it. The stock is down 60% in 2022 after its latest pullback, and trades at the lower end of its 52-week range.
There's no doubt that Nvidia stock could head south as a combination of weak PC (personal computer) demand and restrictions on sales of data center chips to China by the U.S. could wreck its financial performance in the near term. But should savvy investors take advantage of the decline in Nvidia stock and buy it so that they can benefit from the company's long-term growth drivers? Let's find out.
Nvidia stock is cheaper than before, but investors can still wait for a better deal
Nvidia is now trading at 39 times trailing earnings following its latest pullback. While that's lower than the company's five-year average earnings multiple of 58, the valuation is still on the richer side when compared to the Nasdaq 100's price-to-earnings ratio of 24.
Given that Nvidia's earnings are expected to drop in the current fiscal year and investor sentiment is likely to remain negative thanks to the weakness in the PC market and the China ban, the stock could head lower. Analysts are anticipating $3.37 per share in earnings from Nvidia this fiscal year, compared to $4.44 per share in the last one. The top line is expected to remain flat at $27 billion.
So savvy investors can get a better deal on Nvidia and wait for the stock to fall further before jumping in. However, investors shouldn't miss the opportunity to buy Nvidia stock at a cheaper valuation, as the company could bounce back strongly.
It is worth noting that Nvidia was trading at just 18 times trailing earnings in 2018 when the weakness in the graphics card market sent its stock packing. The chipmaker's suffering at that time was caused by the oversupply of graphics cards, which hurt its gaming revenue, and it is in a similar situation now.
The stock rallied tremendously for the next three years after recovering from that slump. It wouldn't be surprising to see something similar unfold over the long run, as Nvidia is now sitting on stronger catalysts than it was back in 2018.
Why the stock could recover in the long run
PC sales could decline 12.8% this year as per IDC's estimates. In 2023, IDC forecasts a 2.6% decline in sales of PCs and tablets. The market is expected to return to growth in 2024, indicating that Nvidia's gaming business could remain under pressure next year.
According to another estimate, the combined sales of gaming PCs and notebooks could increase to 49.4 million units by 2025, compared to last year's sales of 45.4 million units. As a result, demand for the graphics cards used in PCs and notebooks for gaming should head higher. Mordor Intelligence estimates that shipments of gaming GPUs (graphics processing units) could increase at a compound annual growth rate of 14% through 2026.
With Nvidia commanding 80% of this market, the company's gaming business could regain its mojo in the future. At the same time, investors shouldn't forget that Nvidia has a huge installed base of users still on older graphics cards that would require upgrading. Throw in the solid prospects in cloud gaming and Nvidia's dominant position in this fast-growing market, and the gaming business looks set for robust long-term growth.
Moving to the data center business, Nvidia pointed out in September that the restriction would impact its revenue by $400 million in the ongoing quarter. The new restrictions brought into force last week, however, are not going to have an additional impact on Nvidia. Additionally, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang still sees a large market for the company's data center chips in China despite the restrictions.
Meanwhile, the demand for data center accelerators such as graphics cards, central processing units, and data processing units is expected to grow at a solid pace in the long run. The growing adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads will play a key role in boosting the long-term demand for these data center chips. Not surprisingly, the data center accelerator market could clock 25% annual growth through 2028 and generate annual revenue of $25 billion, according to Global Market Insights.
With Nvidia set to step on the gas in the data center market with new products that will unlock new opportunities for the company, this business could get back on its feet eventually. All the catalysts that Nvidia is sitting on indicate why analysts are expecting the company's revenue growth to get back on track starting next fiscal year.
Also, with an estimated five-year annual earnings growth rate of 23%, Nvidia seems built for impressive long-term growth. That's why investors looking to buy a semiconductor stock for the long run should consider taking advantage of further pullbacks in Nvidia's stock price, as the company's near-term troubles could give way to long-term gains.

Oct 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures ticked higher on Friday as investors digested a mixed bag of results from major American banks amid worries about the impact of soaring inflation and tighter monetary policy on corporate earnings.
Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N rose 2.4% in premarket trading after the bank reported third-quarter profit above estimates as a jump in interest income helped cushioned a blow from higher provisions and a slump in dealmaking.
Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N posted a 31% decline in profit as the bank racked up costs related to a fake accounts scandal and boosted its loan loss reserves in preparation for a potential slowdown. Shares of the bank were 1.4% up.
Morgan Stanley MS.N fell 2.3% after it reported a drop in profit, as a slowdown in global dealmaking hurt the investment bank's core underwriting business.
The third-quarter earnings season is keenly watched for the impact of inflation and higher interest rates on corporate profit.
The six biggest U.S. banks are expected to have set aside nearly $5 billion in the third quarter to cover future loan losses, Wall Street analysts said, as lenders brace for a potential global recession.
Keeping the earnings momentum going, UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH.N rose 0.5% after raising its full-year profit forecast as lower spending on COVID testing and treatments helped keep medical costs low.
At 7:18 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 189 points, or 0.63%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 17.75 points, or 0.48%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 29.75 points, or 0.27%.
Shares of Kroger Co KR.N dropped more than 2% after the supermarket chain said on Friday it would buy smaller rival Albertsons Companies Inc ACI.N in a $24.6 billion deal.
Megacap growth and technology stocks such as Meta Platforms Inc META.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O, Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O slipped between 0.6% and 0.9%.
Further on investors' radar are commentaries from a slew of Fed officials like Kansas City President Esther George, Washington Governor Lisa Cook and Cambridge Governor Christopher Waller for any dissent on the rapid rate hike narrative.
On Thursday, all three major stock indexes initially dropped after more-than-expected rise in U.S. consumer prices in September reinforced expectations the Fed will deliver a fourth straight 75-basis-point interest rate hike next month.
However, by close, Wall Street dramatically rebounded from the selloff, advancing over 2% helped by technical support and investors covering short bets. .N

2022-10-17 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Is Rising Today,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-is-rising-today,"What happened
Shares of the semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were jumping this morning on seemingly no company-specific news. Instead, the tech stock is likely moving higher today as investors regained some optimism in the market today, perhaps after two banks beat earnings expectations.
As a result, the S&P 500 was up 2.7%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 3.3%, and Nvidia's shares had gained 4.3% as of 10:48 a.m. ET.
So what
Investors kicked off the week by pushing stocks higher across nearly all sectors as they processed the latest results from Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon, which both reported quarterly financial results that were better than expected.
Image source: Getty Images.
While it may seem odd that two banks' quarterly financial results could sway investor sentiment in other sectors, investors are looking for any positive economic news they can find right now.
Nvidia's investors are hoping that if banks are doing well, then it's possible that the economy may not be slowing down as much as they had feared. That viewpoint may not exactly be correct, but stocks have been beaten down across all sectors -- and especially the tech sector -- over the past year, so investors are taking the good news and running with it.
Now what
Last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its latest consumer pricing data that showed inflation continues to rise at a rapid pace, despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes.
With inflation still at a nearly four-decade high, it's very likely the Fed will continue with significant rate hikes at its next meetings (which are coming up in November and December).
So while some Nvidia shareholders may be getting caught up in today's market optimism, they should also plan for some more volatility as investors react to the Fed's upcoming response to rising inflation.
Nvidia's shareholders will get more perspective on how the company is doing when it reports its latest quarterly financial report, which is estimated to be released on Nov. 16.

Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were firmly in positive territory on Tuesday on rising hopes that upbeat corporate earnings would help eclipse the current economic gloom, with a fiscal policy reversal in Britain also boosting risk appetite.
Big U.S. banks have kicked off the quarterly earnings season on a largely positive note, with Bank of America's BAC.N results underpinning a rally in stocks on Monday.
The reversal of parts of a controversial UK fiscal plan that had roiled bond markets also aided sentiment.
""Initial Q3 company reports have been positive, and you've had some stabilization in the United Kingdom with its government so I think that and generally oversold conditions have been the real driver of equities last few days,"" said Patrick Armstrong, chief investment officer at Plurimi Wealth.
All three of the major U.S. benchmark stock indexes have marked losses of more than 12% over the last two months as investors worry that the U.S. Federal Reserve's war on inflation may hobble the economy.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and Netflix NFLX.O are among the big-ticket earnings scheduled later in the day, with their shares up between 0.5% and 1.2% in premarket trading..N
""Earnings for Q3 generally will be strong. Companies are well trained to guide analysts to earnings estimates that they could meet and beat,"" Armstrong said.
At 05:05 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 269 points, or 0.89%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 40.25 points, or 1.09%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 142.5 points, or 1.28%.
Microsoft Corp MSFT.O gained 1.3% after a report that it was laying off under 1,000 employees this week, becoming the latest U.S. technology company to cut jobs or slow hiring amid a global economic slowdown.
Major mega-cap technology and other growth names like Apple Inc AAPL.O, Meta Platforms MET.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O were up between 1.2% and 1.7%.
Analysts now expect profit for S&P 500 companies to have risen just 3% from a year ago, much lower than an 11.1% increase expected at the start of July, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Industrial production for September due before market open, which is seen rising 0.1% compared to a 0.3% fall in the prior month, will also be on the watch-list.

2022-10-19 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia Stock: Bear vs. Bull,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock%3A-bear-vs.-bull-2,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) bears are out in full force this year as the stock has lost a whopping 60% of its value so far in 2022, and the recent developments in the personal computer (PC) and data center markets suggest that the bears will continue to enjoy an upper hand.
From shrinking sales of PCs that have impacted Nvidia's gaming business to restrictions on sales of data center chips to China, the semiconductor giant is facing substantial headwinds right now. The valuation continues to remain a concern despite shares falling steeply this year, especially considering the consistent increment in interest rates by the Federal Reserve to control inflation.
Amid these headwinds, Nvidia bears will argue that the stock's decline isn't over yet. Let's take a closer look at what their arguments might look like.
What the bears are saying about Nvidia
Nvidia stock trades at a rich 39 times trailing earnings and 10 times sales following its massive decline in 2022. For comparison, the Nasdaq-100 index has a price-to-earnings ratio of 23 and a sales multiple of 2.8, indicating that Nvidia remains overvalued.
The chipmaker will find it difficult to justify this rich valuation, as its growth has hit a wall. The company's fiscal 2023 second-quarter revenue (for the three months ended July 31) was up just 3% year over year to $6.7 billion. Adjusted earnings fell a whopping 51% year over year to $0.51 per share. Nvidia's guidance of $5.9 billion in revenue in the current quarter points toward a 17% year-over-year decline.
Meanwhile, analysts anticipate Nvidia's top line to remain flat in the current fiscal year at $27 billion. They are projecting a 24% drop in the company's earnings. These gloomy projections aren't surprising, as Nvidia's second-largest business -- gaming -- is likely to remain under pressure. The company's gaming revenue was down 33% last quarter, and the projection that PC sales could drop nearly 13% in 2022 means that the demand for gaming graphics cards is likely to remain muted.
Graphics card prices have dropped in recent months thanks to tepid demand and oversupply. Jon Peddie Research estimates that $5.5 billion worth of discrete graphics cards were sold in the second quarter, down by $3.1 billion from Q1, thanks to lower average selling prices and a fall in volumes. Nvidia's graphics card shipments fell 19% quarter over quarter. The sorry situation in the PC market and Nvidia's woeful guidance means that its gaming business may take time to recover.
On the other hand, restrictions on sales of data center chips to Chinese customers could knock the wind out of the sails of its largest business. Nvidia's data center revenue was up 61% year over year last quarter to $3.8 billion. The company has already pointed out that the restrictions could impact its revenue by $400 million, and investors would be hoping that the damage isn't greater when the company releases quarterly results next month.
So, the bearish argument suggests that Nvidia stock could head lower in the short run. But Nvidia bulls may argue that the company is in a solid position to overcome these near-term troubles and soar in the long run.
The bullish argument would focus on the bigger picture
While Nvidia's near-term prospects don't appear to be solid, the bulls would argue that the company can make a robust recovery in the long run. As it turns out, analysts expect a turnaround at Nvidia to start from fiscal 2024 itself. They are anticipating a 13% year-over-year increase in revenue and a 30% spike in earnings.
What's more, the long-term forecast also appears to be good. Analysts are anticipating 23% annual growth in Nvidia's earnings over the next five years. These rosy projections aren't surprising, as Nvidia's two major end markets -- gaming and data center -- are built for long-term growth. The gaming graphics card market, for instance, could clock 14% growth annually through 2026, according to Mordor Intelligence.
Meanwhile, the data center accelerator market is expected to clock faster annual growth of nearly 39% through 2027. As Nvidia is the leading player in both these markets and looking to expand its addressable revenue opportunity with an entry into the server processor space, bulls would say that the gaming and the data center markets would eventually regain their mojo.
It is also worth noting that the automotive, omniverse, and cloud gaming markets could play a massive role in driving Nvidia's growth over the next decade.
What should investors do?
The bullish argument indicates that Nvidia could turn out to be a terrific bet in the long run, but the company will have to navigate the near-term problems it's facing. The stock could head lower until there are concrete signs of a turnaround, which is why it would make sense for investors to wait for Nvidia to drop further before buying it to take advantage of the multiple opportunities that could drive the company's growth.

2022-10-20 00:00:00+00:00,"Despite the Correction, Should You Bet on Semiconductor Stocks?",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/despite-the-correction-should-you-bet-on-semiconductor-stocks,"Semiconductor stocks have underperformed so far this year. For instance, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) are down about 60%, 59%, 48%, and 54%, respectively, year-to-date. Despite this significant correction, these stocks could stay under pressure due to multiple headwinds, including the slowdown in demand and the U.S. government’s new regulations for exports to China.
Recently, Lam Research delivered better-than-expected September quarter results. Its revenues of $5.07 billion came ahead of the Street’s expectations of $4.9 billion. Further, its adjusted EPS of $10.42 surpassed analysts’ estimates of $9.57.
While its top and bottom lines exceeded estimates, Lam Research expects the new U.S. export restrictions to negatively impact its financials by $2-$2.5 billion in the calendar year 2023. Earlier, Nvidia stated that it could lose $400 million in sales due to the new restrictions. 
Providing his outlook on the semiconductor sector, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland said, “We downgraded the Semiconductor sector in April ’21 based on a combination of high valuation multiples and “over-ordering,” and while multiples have indeed corrected, we still wait for excess inventory to work through the system (PC/Handset/Consumer working now; Industrial/Auto/Broad-based still yet to come).” 
While Rolland doesn’t see a valuation risk, inventory and growing macro headwinds remain a concern. 
Bottom Line 
While semiconductor stocks remain pressured, let’s see how they stack up on TipRanks’ valuable datasets. With the help of TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, here is a summary of how these stocks compare.
TipRanks’ data shows that Wall Street is cautiously optimistic about the prospects of AMD, NVDA, and LRCX stocks. These companies sport a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TipRanks. However, analysts remain sidelined on Intel stock, which has a Hold consensus rating. 
Further, AMD, NVDA, and INTC stocks have a Neutral Smart Score on TipRanks, and their stocks are likely to perform in line with the broader market. On the contrary, Lam Research stock has an Outperform Smart Score of nine out of 10, while analysts’ average price target of $498.65 implies 51.1% upside potential.

2022-10-24 00:00:00+00:00,Can Netflix Crush Nvidia in This $40 Billion Market?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-netflix-crush-nvidia-in-this-%2440-billion-market,"Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) crushed Wall Street's expectations, delivering a solid set of numbers for the third quarter. Most notably, it added an impressive 2.41 million net new paid subscribers while analysts were anticipating an increase of just 1 million, but there's a bigger story cooking in the background that investors may want to take a closer look at.
The video streaming specialist seems all set to dive into a new market that could unlock a huge long-term growth opportunity. At tech-focused online publication TechCrunch's Disrupt event, Mike Verdu -- Netflix's vice president of gaming -- said that the company is ""seriously exploring a cloud gaming offering."" Verdu added that Netflix is opening a new game development studio in Southern California.
It is worth noting that Netflix also set up a gaming studio in Finland last month. The latest addition will take its total number of gaming studios to five.
Fortune Business Insights estimates that cloud gaming generated $1.7 billion in total revenue last year. But the market research firm expects that the niche will clock annualized growth of 43% through 2029, when the forecast points to $40 billion in annual revenue. So it's not too surprising that Netflix is putting serious thought into its plans to tap that explosive market.
Netflix believes it can succeed in cloud gaming
The cloud gaming market is taking off thanks to the advantages it enjoys over the traditional modes of delivering games -- such as eliminating the need to purchase high-end hardware and expensive gaming titles. Yet, not many companies have cracked this market so far.
Technology giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), for instance, recently announced that it will shut down its Google Stadia cloud gaming service in January. Though Alphabet says that Stadia is ""built on a strong technology foundation,"" the lack of traction among users is what's led the company to pull the plug on this service.
Netflix believes it can succeed where Google Stadia failed. At the TechCrunch conference, Verdu explained that Netflix plans to offer cloud gaming as an additional service -- one that won't require subscribers to replace their gaming consoles.
The digital media veteran aims to deliver its cloud games to subscribers on the same devices where they are already consuming its streaming video content -- personal computers, smartphones, and TVs. Netflix had 223 million paying subscribers as of the end of the third quarter. That's a huge customer base to whom it could cross-sell a cloud gaming service.
Since cloud games are run on remote servers and are delivered to gamers via fast internet connections, all Netflix needs to do is create a healthy library of games and sell the gaming service as an add-on subscription. After all, cloud gaming doesn't require customers to upgrade to expensive hardware as data centers do all the heavy lifting.
However, that will be easier said than done. Another tech powerhouse has already become the dominant player in this nascent space.
An Nvidia-sized obstacle is waiting for the streaming giant
Graphics card specialist Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is leading the cloud gaming market in terms of both revenue and subscribers. On its August earnings conference call, it pointed out that its GeForce Now cloud gaming service has more than 20 million members. It is also worth noting that Nvidia has a massive cloud gaming library of over 1,350 titles thanks to the company's consistent efforts to bring more games onto the GeForce Now platform.
This is where Netflix pales in comparison to Nvidia. The company has just 35 gaming titles on the market and 55 games in development for its cloud platform right now. And Nvidia's expertise in critical gaming hardware such as graphics cards gives it another advantage. Its platform -- run on servers powered by RTX 3080 graphics cards -- streams titles at high resolutions and rapid refresh rates.
That's another area where Netflix will need to come close to Nvidia to cut its teeth in cloud gaming and give its growth rate a shot in the arm. The video streamer's revenue increased by just 6% year over year last quarter to $7.9 billion, while its earnings contracted to $3.10 per share from $3.19 per share a year earlier.
Analysts aren't upbeat about Netflix's prospects. They anticipate annualized earnings growth of just 3% for the next five years. So, a new catalyst such as cloud gaming could give Netflix a much-needed boost, but the company will have a long way to go to make a name for itself in this market, especially considering that it is going up against a video gaming giant that is already making the most of its first-mover advantage.

2022-10-25 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Nvidia, Shopify, and Roku Stocks Rallied Early Tuesday",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-shopify-and-roku-stocks-rallied-early-tuesday,"What happened
A broad cross-section of stocks resumed the rally that began earlier this month. This helped many stocks pull higher, following the updraft of the broader market indexes as they gained ground. Many technology stocks have been punished since reaching highs late last year and investors are increasingly convinced that while market volatility may remain prevalent for some time, there may be light at the end of the tunnel, suggesting the worst of the bear market may be in the rearview mirror.
As a result, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) surged 3.6%, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) jumped 4.8%, and Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) gained 7.3% as of 12:58 p.m. ET.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
After a review of all the usual sources, including regulatory filings, changes to analysts' opinions, and earnings reports, very little in the way of company-specific news emerged to explain the surge in Shopify, Nvidia, and Roku's share prices.
Rather, after considering the broad macroeconomic headwinds, investors appear convinced that stocks may be much closer to the bottom than the top and are searching for compelling opportunities. Indeed, the major market indexes remain firmly entrenched in bear market territory, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite down 20% and 31%, respectively, from their highs reached late last year.
These periods of economic unrest have historically been among the best times to buy stocks to hold for the long term. This continuing reality had bargain hunters scouring the investing landscape, looking for beaten-down stocks to add to their portfolios.
Investor sentiment has turned largely positive in October, however, helping push the major market indexes higher. Technology stocks have been among those hardest hit over the past year, as many carry higher valuations consistent with better growth prospects. Many stock buyers shunned higher-risk, higher-reward investments in favor of safer places to park their money until the macroeconomic storm subsides.
This threesome make up solid examples of the resulting fallout on technology stocks, as Nvidia has fallen 61%, Shopify is down by 82%, and Roku has dropped 83% compared to last year's highs.
On a more positive note, however, investors are increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve's ongoing battle to control rampant inflation might finally be yielding results.
One such indicator is the slowing in retail real estate. The U.S. housing market, which has been on fire, is finally moderating. Existing home sales declined 1.5% sequentially in September and are down a whopping 23.8% year over year.
While median home prices rose 8.4%, it marked the third consecutive month of slowing gains. This data suggests that the Fed's campaign of rising interest rates may finally be having the desired effect.
Furthermore, comments by Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari suggest the central bank expects inflation to abate in the coming months. ""My best guess right now is yes, do I think inflation is going to level out over the next few months, the services, the core inflation, and then that would position us some time next year to potentially pause [interest rate hikes],"" Kashkari said at an event last week.
This, and increasingly optimistic investor sentiment, has helped propel the broader markets higher, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have gained 7.2% and 5.6%, respectively, so far this month.
Now what
While investors are currently optimistic, the market is only one negative economic indicator away from resuming its downtrend, so there are likely further share price swings ahead for Nvidia, Shopify, and Roku.
As inflation remains near 40-year highs, consumers are paring back e-commerce spending, foregoing the latest gaming processors, and putting off the purchase of a new connected TV or streaming device, which will weigh on the near-term results of Shopify, Nvidia, and Roku, respectively. Given the economic uncertainty, cautious purchasing decisions will likely also be the hallmark for the upcoming holiday season as well. On the other hand, the current landscape has resulted in the cheapest valuations in years for our trio of stocks, making them particularly appealing to those that plan to hold for the coming three to five years.
Some investors will still consider Nvidia and Shopify somewhat pricey, currently selling for 10 times and 6 times next year's sales. Roku is the cheapest of the three, with a price-to-sales ratio of 2. That doesn't mean these stocks can't fall further -- they certainly could. Still, for investors with the appropriate investing time horizon, these industry leaders have a history of beating the market in the long run.

2022-10-26 00:00:00+00:00,2 Tech Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-tech-stocks-you-can-buy-and-hold-for-the-next-decade-3,"Volatility on Wall Street can make investors more focused on the short term. With markets making big moves powered by sentiment swings right now, it's only natural to look at a portfolio's returns over the last few weeks or months.
But the real returns accrue to investors who think in terms of years and decades.
With that broader outlook in mind, let's look at tech stocks that should be setting sales records in 10 or more years. Read on for some good reasons to buy Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE).
1. Nvidia
The semiconductor industry is famously cyclical, meaning it goes through frequent large demand swings. Nvidia's latest earnings results demonstrate this process at work. The chip giant reported a painful 33% decline in its gaming division in the second quarter, which ended in late July. Earnings fell even faster, down 72% as gross profit margin dived to 44% of sales from 65% a year ago.
This isn't Nvidia's first time experiencing such a pullback, and it has emerged from all previous downturns with a stronger business. There's every reason to assume the company will be serving more data-center, gaming, and autonomous-driving platforms in a few years. ""We will get through this,"" CEO Jensen Huang told investors back in late August.
Buying the stock at a volatile time like this makes it a bit more likely that you'll see short-term declines. But you can be confident that Nvidia is pouring cash into its innovation pipeline today so that it can be ready to lead through the next cyclical upswing. That's the absolute right approach to support long-term growth.
2. Adobe
Adobe hasn't been facing the sharp growth slowdown or profitability plunge that have affected Nvidia in 2022. Yet the software specialist's stock is still underperforming the market, down by nearly 45% so far in 2022. That sell-off seems like an overreaction.
Sure, Adobe isn't growing as quickly as it did in earlier phases of the pandemic, when work was flooding into the online world. Its creative cloud platform is expanding at a roughly 20% pace today compared to over 30% a year ago. Investors are also worried that the company's $20 billion acquisition of Figma will pressure earnings in 2023 and cause integration challenges.
That purchase is a bold long-term bet, though, that will help Adobe fill out its product portfolio so that it becomes a more essential service platform to enterprises and consumers. It isn't pushing the company into debt, either.
ADBE cash from operations (TTM). Data by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months.
Adobe's next few quarters might feature rocky sales and earnings results, but long-term investors can keep a closer eye on annual cash flow. That metric has been on a steady upswing since 2015 thanks to the company's successfully software-as-a-service selling model.
This cash is helping fund aggressive growth initiatives, but it also gives management lots of flexibility to navigate through a period of potentially weak demand.
Long-term investors don't have to worry about those inevitable ups and downs that occur in any given year. With an eye toward 2030 and beyond, you have a great shot at earning market-beating returns with tech giants like Nvidia and Adobe.

While the potentially dovish Fed continued to dominate investor participation in the market, disappointing earnings numbers coming in from the tech sector acted as a dampener. Two of the three major indexes ended in negative territory, while one ended marginally in the green.
How Did The Benchmarks Perform?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.01% or 2.37 points to close at 31,839.11 points. Twenty-two components of the 30-stock index ended in the green, while eight ended in the red.
The S&P 500 lost 0.7% or 28.51 points to finish at 3,830.6 points. Six of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in the green. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) and the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) advanced 1.4%, 1.1% and 0.7%, respectively, while the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) declined 3.2%.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 2% or 228.12 points to end at 10,970.99 points, dragged down by tech stocks.
The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 4.2% to 27.28. A total of 12.3 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 11.6 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.
Nasdaq Leads Session’s Losses
While the Dow managed to keep its head above the water and marginally finished in the green for a fourth straight session, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq weighed down heavily on the market. Nasdaq bore the maximum brunt and slid more than 2% on disappointing earnings numbers coming in from mega-cap tech giants, Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.
Microsoft reported its first-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Wednesday. Its net income in the quarter was $17.6 billion, down 14% year over year. The company reported earnings of $2.35 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate earnings of $2.29. The tech firm noted that its Windows OEM business revenues, including its Windows operating system, decreased 15%, with continued deterioration in the PC market. Microsoft’s shares fell 7.7% on the report.
Alphabet announced earnings of $1.06 per share in third-quarter 2022, widely missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25. It reported a net profit of $13.9 billion, down 27% from a year earlier, while revenues climbed 6% to $69.1 billion. Alphabet’s shares plunged 9.1% on the report. This is the third straight quarter of disappointing earnings from the tech behemoth.
The news triggered a sell-off in the market, threatening to wipe out more than $400 billion from some of the largest U.S. companies, with investors pondering whether this year’s $5.5 trillion tech rout has reached its bottom. Nasdaq, being a tech-dominated index, suffered the most from the fallout of the market sentiment and snapped a three-day winning streak. Even as the mood continued to revolve around positive signals coming in from the Fed, the tech stocks slumped. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) slid 2.2%.
Shares of Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA dropped 4.1% and 2.8%, respectively. Both carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
New Home Sales Plunge in September
New home sales came in at 603,000 for September, higher than the consensus of 600,000 for the period but significantly less than the downwardly revised number of 677,000 for August. Mortgage rates have hit their highest level in more than two decades, and the Fed’s policies have proven to act as a deterrent in the sector. The report reinforces the belief that the Fed is now starting to see its stringent measures taking effect and would now take stock, lest it pushes the economy into a slowdown.
Economic Data
According to a government report, for the week ending Oct 21, 2022, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 2.6 million barrels from the previous week. At 439.9 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are about 2% below the five-year average for this time of year.

2022-10-28 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Shares of Nvidia, AMD, and Skyworks Are Rallying Today",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-shares-of-nvidia-amd-and-skyworks-are-rallying-today,"What happened
Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS) were all up big on Friday, rising 4.1%, 5.5%, and 4%, respectively, as of 1:54 p.m. EDT.
None of these companies have reported earnings yet, although AMD did announce worse-than-expected results in its PC division earlier this month.
The synchronous move highlighted a good day for semiconductor stocks generally. The semiconductor outperformance likely came from a combination of better-than-feared earnings from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) last night, as well as some better-than-feared economic data in the U.S. this morning.
So what
Last night, Apple beat analyst estimates for both revenue and earnings, and Intel delivered in-line revenue with a bottom-line beat.
Expectations were very low heading into each earnings report, since it had been well documented that both the PC and handset markets are in a sharp slowdown. Therefore, to see a result that wasn't as bad as feared is likely helping sentiment today.
Intel also said that the PC market remained difficult, and the company plans for units to be flat to slightly down next year, even with units down by the mid to high teens already in 2022. CEO Pat Gelsinger said the data center market was holding up better, although Intel was losing market share at the moment.
The 2023 outlook might perhaps indicate a bottom in PCs for some investors, because Gelsinger also said use of PCs is still above pre-pandemic levels. And that should mean a higher overall addressable market, despite the near-term correction.
And resilient data center investment bodes well for Nvidia and AMD, with AMD taking share from Intel in data center CPUs and Nvidia being the market leader in artificial intelligence focused GPUs.
Wireless chip company Skyworks is also likely benefiting from Apple's good results, as Skyworks generates just over half its revenue from the iPhone giant.
Semiconductor stocks are also very economically sensitive, and tend to respond to good or bad macroeconomic news. This morning, the Employment Cost Index released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a slowing of private-sector wage growth, which was taken well by the markets.
Although the three-month seasonally adjusted rate of growth was 1.2% and the year-over-year growth was 5.2%, both figures marked a significant slowdown from June's 1.6% and 5.7% growth figures, respectively.
Wage inflation had been one of the main sources of overall core services inflation, which in turn affects the path of Fed rate increases. So these slowing numbers show that this summer's rapid rate hikes could be having their intended effect. That means the Federal Reserve might not have to go materially higher than their forecast in terms of interest rates to slow inflation to its target. That would be good news for the economy overall.
Meanwhile, consumer spending metrics from September also came in higher than expected, despite worries over inflation and a deceleration in wages. Solid consumer spending along with falling inflation would be a Goldilocks scenario (not too hot and not too cold) for the Fed and the economy.
Now what
It's quite possible that these semiconductor stocks will continue to rise, even if revenue and earnings results come in poorly over the next couple of quarters. After all, these stocks began to decline even while earnings were good earlier this year, in anticipation of a downturn brought on by inflation and the Fed's interest rate hikes.
Now that a downturn is here, especially in the PC market, investors might be sensing a bottom and looking ahead to a recovery. The lower wage-inflation figures are likely helping to spur optimism that the Fed might soon be done with its restrictive interest rate increases.
There is still a high degree of uncertainty in the outlook, since a number of factors, including geopolitical issues, could continue to throw the economy surprises. But today's data was certainly encouraging.
With shares of Nvidia and AMD down between 55% and 60% on the year, even after the recent bounce, and with Skyworks down 45%, it's no surprise to see them being bought heavily on the first signs of a potential slowdown in inflation.

2022-10-31 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Fell Today,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-fell-today,"What happened
Shares of graphics chip leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) fell by more than 3% in early trading Monday, and were down by 1.9% as of 1:44 p.m. ET.
The Nasdaq Composite was also down more than 1% in early trading, giving back some of the strong gains it made Friday on the back of last week's optimistic wage inflation news. Monday's slide could merely be the result of traders taking some money off the table before more economic data arrives and the Federal Reserve holds its next meeting.
Many semiconductor names were down Monday, perhaps reflecting investors' fears of an economic slowdown.
So what
High-multiple growth stocks as a class were having a tough time in early trading Monday as the 10-year Treasury Bond yield rose slightly to 4.04% after a week or so of steady declines. Nvidia, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 36, is still quite sensitive to interest rate moves, as higher rates will lower the value of any asset with most of its cash flows coming far into the future.
It also doesn't help when sales growth is stalling. Unfortunately, Nvidia has had to weather several headwinds over the past few months. These included a huge inventory glut of its older RTX graphics chips, as well as the U.S. government's decision in late August to ban sales of high-end data center GPUs to China.
Nvidia's gaming revenue declined by 33% in its fiscal 2023 second quarter (which ended July 31), and management forecast a 12% drop in overall revenue for its fiscal third quarter. Keep in mind, though, that it made that forecast before the Biden administration announced those restrictions on sales to China. Management has said the ban could impact some $400 million of revenue in its fiscal Q3 -- leading to another 7% revenue decline, according to guidance.
In fact, Northland Capital analyst Gus Richard on Monday downgraded Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) from buy to neutral and cut his price target on the company from $80 to $60, based on his view that chip sales to China could be slow to recover. That downgrade could also be affecting Nvidia's stock.
On the bright side, Nvidia is two weeks away from releasing its new Lovelace 4000 Series graphics cards on the market -- the latest generation in its RTX line. The new chips have begun appearing on online retailers' websites already, and in the U.S., they're being listed at close to the suggested retail price Nvidia set when it unveiled them this summer.
The impending release of the new RTX graphics cards could in part explain why sales of the older 3000 series chips were weak this summer, but it's hard to be sure. Consumers' disposable incomes are being crimped by high inflation, and the PC market is experiencing its worst annual decline since the 1990s as the pandemic-fueled boom in personal computer sales has ground to a halt.
Some worrying inflation data also came out Monday in the Eurozone. Energy and food prices continued to spike, and overall inflation accelerated to 10.7% year over year in October, which doesn't bode well for Nvidia's sales in Europe. That's especially true as Nvidia's RTX chips are being listed at higher prices there right now (though part of the price difference is attributable to value-added taxes in the region).
Now what
Nvidia got a boost last week as several large cloud services companies and other big tech players announced plans for capital expenditure increases. That should lead to higher sales of Nvidia's data center chips. However, it looks as though 2023 could be a challenging year for Nvidia's graphics card business, as there aren't any signs of impending spending recoveries in the PC, gaming, or crypto mining niches.
But with Nvidia shares down 53% on the year, one key question is: How much negativity is already priced into the stock? The market is forward-looking, so Nvidia's stock could fare better in 2023 even if graphics revenue and overall earnings decline. However, investors should probably steel themselves for additional disappointing earnings reports in 2023.
Consumer sales probably won't meaningfully turn around until central banks get inflation back under control, and it's hard to predict when that will happen. Investors will get more insights on that front Wednesday when the Federal Reserve holds its November meeting, at which it's expected to hike the benchmark federal funds rate by another 0.75 percentage points (75 basis points).

2022-11-01 00:00:00+00:00,What to Expect from Qualcomm Earnings and QCOM Stock,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-qualcomm-earnings-and-qcom-stock,"Trading 39% from its highs, all eyes will be on Qualcomm’s QCOM fiscal Q4 earnings release on November 2. Investors will get the first glimpse of how the largest semiconductor companies are handling high inflation with NVIDIA NVDA and others set to report later this month.
The report will show the broader demand for Qualcomm’s integrated circuits (ICs) and the need for its Code Division Multiple Access Technology (CDMA). CDMA is an example of Qualcomm being an innovation leader in designing, manufacturing, and marketing digital wireless telecom products. QCOM’s stock is still holding up better than broader markets over the last year despite a lackluster YTD performance.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Overview
Qualcomm’s business is largely derived from selling processors and modems for smartphones. Last quarter, the company’s handset business grew 59% year over year to $6.15 billion. Qualcomm reported total revenue of $10.93 billion, which was also up 37% year over year. This helped QCOM beat earnings expectations by 3% at $2.96 per share, up 53% year over year.
Despite the beats on both its top and bottom lines last quarter, the stock was slightly down after earnings. The decline was due to the company offering weak guidance for its fiscal Q4 amid what it already stated was a challenging macroeconomic environment.
Fiscal Q4 Outlook
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for QCOM’s fiscal Q4 earnings is $3.15 per share, which would represent a 23% increase from Q4 2021. Sales are expected to be up 22% at $11.38 billion. Earnings estimates for the period have remained unchanged throughout the quarter.
Year over year, QCOM earnings are expected to climb 47% and rise another 1% in FY23 at $12.66 per share. Top line growth is expected as well, with sales projected to be up 31% this year and rise another 5% in FY23 to $46.55 billion.
However, full-year earnings estimates for the current year, next quarter, and FY23 have declined over the last 90 days. In addition to earnings, Wall Street will certainly be paying close attention to Qualcomm’s FY23 guidance as the current market environment is still tougher on technology companies. 
Performance & Valuation
Year to date QCOM is down -36% to underperform the S&P 500’s -20% and closer to the Nasdaq’s -30%. Longer-term investors are hoping QCOM can get back to its strong performance with the stock crushing the benchmark and the Nasdaq over the last five years. This is especially true when adding QCOM’s solid dividend yield for the stock’s total return.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
After reaching 52-week highs of $193.58 last January QCOM’s stock has plummeted to $117 per share. At current levels, QCOM has a P/E of 10.3X. This is well below its peer group’s 24.7X. The stock also trades at a discount to its decade-high of 36.9X and the median of 16.5X.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Bottom Line
Despite trading at a discount relative to its past, QCOM currently lands a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in correlation to declining earnings estimates for this year, next quarter, and FY23. Although Qualcomm’s Wireless Equipment Industry is in the top 16% of over 250 Zacks Industries, investors will want to pay close attention to the company’s outlook and guidance because of the downward revisions.
Long-term the stock is starting to look attractive, but more short-term pain could be ahead considering the current chip and tech headwinds.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2022-11-02 00:00:00+00:00,Did Meta Platforms Just Give Nvidia a Big Shot in the Arm?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/did-meta-platforms-just-give-nvidia-a-big-shot-in-the-arm,"Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) stock cratered following the company's third-quarter report that was released on Oct. 26, 2022, as it became evident that the social media giant is unlikely to come out of its slump anytime soon.
The massive decline in Meta's margins thanks to shrinking revenue and rising costs led investors to press the panic button hard following the company's results, sending the stock down more than 20%. However, Meta's bad report also contained a boon for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors. Shares of the semiconductor giant gained after Meta revealed it is going to ramp up capital spending next year.
Let's check if Nvidia investors are right about celebrating Meta's plan to boost capex in 2023.
Meta Platforms is going to ramp up spending on artificial intelligence in 2023
Meta Platforms CFO Dave Wehner pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that the company's 2023 capital expenditures could range between $34 billion and $39 billion. The midpoint of that range -- $36.5 billion -- points toward an increase of 12% from 2022's estimated capital expenditure of $32.5 billion.
Wehner also added, ""An increase in AI capacity is driving substantially all of our capital expenditure growth in 2023."" The Facebook parent's plan to enhance artificial intelligence (AI) spending next year rubbed off positively on Nvidia stock. That's not surprising as Nvidia's chips have been playing a key role in driving Meta's AI ambitions.
In January 2022, Nvidia revealed that Meta has chosen Nvidia's chips to train AI models in the AI Research SuperCluster (RSC) supercomputer. Nvidia provided more than 6,000 of its A100 data center GPUs (graphics processing units) to Meta for AI RSC, a number that's expected to go up to 16,000 by the end of the year.
It is worth noting that this was the second time Meta chose Nvidia's chips to power its AI research infrastructure. The social media giant selected Nvidia's chips in its first-generation AI infrastructure back in 2017 when it used 22,000 V100 GPUs to train AI models. Nvidia claims that the new supercomputer is going to be 20 times faster while running computer vision jobs and three times faster when running natural language processing models as compared to the first-generation infrastructure.
What's more, Meta intends to enhance its data center capacity in 2023. All these bode well for Nvidia given its tight relationship with Meta in AI and data centers. For instance, Meta announced a new AI platform based on Nvidia's H100 Tensor Core GPUs in mid-October.
In all, Meta's plans to increase spending on AI infrastructure in 2023 could give Nvidia's data center business a much-needed boost, especially considering the recent developments in this space.
Stimulus for Nvidia's data center business
The data center business has been one of the few bright spots for Nvidia at a time when its other key business -- video gaming -- is cracking. Nvidia's data center revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 (for the three months ended July 31, 2022) jumped an impressive 61% year over year to $3.8 billion.
However, the restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on sales of data center chips to China have the potential to knock the wind out of the sails -- and sales -- of Nvidia's data center business. The company sees a $400 million hit to its data center revenue in the current quarter thanks to the restrictions. Nvidia may be able to mitigate the negative impact of the restrictions now that a key customer in the form of Meta Platforms decided to ramp up spending on data centers and AI infrastructure.
As such, Nvidia investors are right to cheer Meta's move to increase spending in 2023. However, they shouldn't forget that the weakness in the PC market could weigh on Nvidia's performance. Meta alone may not be enough to bring the semiconductor company out of its rut.
Nvidia is expected to generate $3.35 per share in adjusted earnings in fiscal 2023 compared to last year's figure of $4.44 per share. Its top line is expected to remain flat at $27 billion. So, even if Nvidia gets a nice chunk of Meta's planned capex increase of $4 billion next year, the company would need to find growth in other areas to justify its expensive valuation.
Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio of 45 is quite high as compared to the Nasdaq 100's multiple of 23 even though the stock has slumped 55% in 2022. Given its poor growth prospects in the near term, Nvidia may not be able to justify its rich valuation despite Meta's increased spending.
That's why savvy investors may want to wait for concrete signs of a turnaround in Nvidia's business. There may be opportunities to buy this semiconductor stock at a cheaper valuation if they want to take advantage of its lucrative long-term growth opportunities.

2022-11-03 00:00:00+00:00,Is Intel Stock a Buy Now?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-intel-stock-a-buy-now-0,"Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) stock jumped 11% on Oct. 28 after the chipmaker posted its third-quarter earnings report. Its revenue declined 20% year over year (and fell 15% on an adjusted basis, which excludes the ongoing divestment of its NAND business) to $15.3 billion, which matched analysts' expectations. Its adjusted earnings dropped 59% to $0.59 per share but still cleared the consensus forecast by $0.26.
For the full year, Intel expects its revenue to drop 19% to 20% (14% to 16% on an adjusted basis), compared to its prior forecast for 9% to 13% decline, as it faces ""continued macroeconomic headwinds."" It expects its adjusted EPS to decline 64%, compared to its previous forecast for a 58% decline.
Image source: Intel.
Those headline numbers were dismal, but investors had already tempered their expectations after AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and other chipmakers warned of the PC market's slowdown in a post-pandemic market. A lot of those concerns had already caused Intel's stock to shed more than 40% of its value over the past 12 months.
Instead, investors seemed to mainly focus on Intel's planned cost-cutting measures and its recent spinoff of Mobileye (NASDAQ: MBLY), which raised $861 million for its former parent in its IPO. But will those streamlining strategies set a floor under Intel's plummeting stock and make it a compelling long-term investment again?
What happened to Intel?
Over the past several years, Intel struggled with chip shortages and product delays as it fell behind TSMC (NYSE: TSM) in the ""process race"" to manufacture smaller and denser chips. Those problems caused Intel to lose ground to AMD -- which outsourced the production of its CPUs to TSMC -- in the desktop and notebook markets. Intel also grappled with jarring management changes as it tried to resolve those issues; it's now on its third CEO in just over four years.
The pandemic still boosted Intel's sales as more consumers upgraded their PCs to work from home, attend online classes, and play higher-end games. The elevated usage of cloud-based services during that period also prompted data centers to upgrade their chips. As a result, Intel's revenue and adjusted EPS still increased 8% and 9%, respectively, in 2020.
Unfortunately, the cracks started to appear again as those tailwinds dissipated. Instead of becoming a fabless chipmaker like AMD, Intel doubled down on upgrading its plants to catch up to TSMC by 2025. As a result, its expenses started rising as its revenue growth cooled off. Its adjusted revenue grew just 2% in 2021 as its adjusted EPS increased 7%.
Those headwinds have intensified in 2022
Intel generated 53% of its revenue from its client computing group (CCG) in the third quarter. The data center and AI (DCAI) segment brought in 27% of its revenues, while another 15% came from its network and edge (NEX) group. The remaining 5% came from its other smaller businesses.
Over the past year, the CCG segment has struggled with the slowdown of the PC market. Inflation and other macroeconomic headwinds have also caused its data center customers (especially in China) to curb their spending.

These headwinds could persist for the foreseeable future. IDC expects global shipments of personal computing devices (PCs and tablets) to drop 10.8% this year and dip another 2.3% in 2023, while the Biden Administration's recent export ban on advanced semiconductors to China will make it even more difficult for its data center business to recover.
Reining in its spending to cope with that slowdown
But there's a silver lining: that slowdown is forcing Intel to rein in its aggressive spending plans. It reduced its full-year capex forecast to just $21 billion, compared to its prior target of $27 billion, and CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company would take ""aggressive actions to reduce costs"" and ""optimize our headcount"" during the conference call. Intel's gross and operating margins still declined year over year in the third quarter, but they improved sequentially as its spending slowed down.

During the call, CFO Dave Zinsner said Intel could grow its gross margin toward 51% to 53% in the ""short term"" and toward the 60s over a ""multiyear journey"" as its operating margins rise into the 40s.
Is it the right time to buy Intel?
Intel's stock might seem cheap at 15 times this year's adjusted earnings, and it pays an attractive forward dividend yield of 5%. But it also hasn't given investors any compelling reasons to buy its stock -- its core markets are sputtering out, it still remains far behind TSMC in the process race, and cutting costs probably won't help it generate any near-term sales growth. Investors should stay away from Intel for now, especially when plenty of better semiconductor stocks are still on sale.

That's the old adage we use to remind ourselves to look for the positives in bad situations. It's a saying that investors might want to keep in mind these days.
There are plenty of clouds -- dark ones -- looming over the stock market right now. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index are entrenched in bear markets. Many of the high-flying stocks of the last several years have plummeted.
But there are silver linings to be found. Here are three stocks down 50% or more that are screaming bear-market buys.
1. Nvidia
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) ranks as the biggest company with shares down at least 50% so far this year. The stock has plunged nearly 60% below its high reached in late 2021.
The chipmaker's growth has practically ground to a halt. Nvidia reported that its fiscal 2023 second-quarter revenue increased only 3% year over year and fell 19% sequentially. The company's profits tumbled 72% year over year. But I think there are two main reasons to buy Nvidia stock hand over fist.
First, the company's headwinds are only temporary. NVidia faces supply chain problems and macroeconomic uncertainty that won't last forever. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in August, ""We are navigating our supply chain transitions in a challenging macro environment and we will get through this."" I agree.
Second, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) will be increasingly used in data centers and autonomous vehicles. Nvidia is well-positioned to lead the way with the next generations of its graphics processing units (GPUs).
2. MongoDB
MongoDB (NASDAQ: MDB) has been hit especially hard this year, with its shares sinking more than 70%. But the database maker's stock has still delivered a gain of more than 5x over the past five years, showing just how high MongoDB soared before this year's sell-off.
Unlike Nvidia, though, MongoDB continues to deliver sizzling growth. In its fiscal 2023 Q2, the company reported that its revenue soared 53% year over year. It also easily beat Wall Street earnings estimates.
One problem for MongoDB is that its ""earnings"" remain losses at this point. Its bottom line is also moving in the wrong direction. The main culprit is stock-based compensation, which jumped 67% year over year in the latest quarter.
Still, the long-term trends definitely work in MongoDB's favor. More and more data continues to be generated. That data must be stored somewhere -- with the cloud as the top destination. When the stock market rebounds (which it will absolutely do sooner or later), I expect that MongoDB will return to its winning ways.
3. Medical Properties Trust
Nvidia and MongoDB will mainly appeal to growth-oriented investors. But is there a beaten-down stock that income investors would like? I think so. Medical Properties Trust's (NYSE: MPW) shares have fallen a little over 50% year to date. And there's a good case to be made that the stock is a screaming buy.
Medical Properties Trust is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that leases properties to hospital operators. Its dividend yield currently tops 10%. The company has increased its dividend for eight consecutive years.
The main knock against Medical Properties Trust is that many of its tenants face big challenges right now. Some hospital operators are struggling financially. One of the REIT's tenants even filed for bankruptcy recently.
However, Medical Properties Trust has successfully navigated similar difficult environments in the past. The company remains highly profitable with a solid financial position. Also, the outlook for its tenants should improve as their reimbursements increase in 2023.
I think now is a good time for income investors who aren't afraid of some volatility to lock in an exceptionally juicy yield with this stock.

2022-11-09 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Unveils Sub-$1000 High-End Graphics Cards,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-unveils-sub-%241000-high-end-graphics-cards,"Graphics card leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced new high-end graphics cards in September, the first in its new RTX 4000 series. Performance gains over Nvidia's previous-generation cards are enormous, partly due to improved software powered by artificial intelligence (AI). The RTX 4090 delivered a 55% improvement in frames per second over the RTX 3090 Ti across eight games tested by Tom's Hardware at a 4K resolution and using the highest settings.
Nvidia's new cards come at a steep price. The RTX 4090 has a launch price of $1,599, while the slower RTX 4080 is priced at $1,199. Actual prices at retail are substantially higher. On Newegg, many RTX 4090 models currently go for more than $2,000.
A lower-priced option from AMD
Nvidia's high pricing for its top-tier models opens the door for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) to attempt to steal away some market share. Earlier this month, AMD unveiled its own high-end graphics cards, the RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT. These are the first graphics cards to use AMD's chiplet design, a modular approach that can lead to better yields, improved performance, and superior power efficiency.
Thanks to AMD's chiplet-based architecture, the company was able to use multiple process nodes for different parts of its graphics chip. The result is a 54% boost to performance-per-watt under the best-case scenario compared to AMD's previous-generation products. AI throughput has been increased by a factor of 2.7, increasingly important as AI-powered software is used to boost frame rates, and raytracing performance is as much as 1.8 times faster.
Notably, AMD's new graphics cards are far less expensive than Nvidia's new RTX 4000 graphics cards. When they launch in early December, the RX 7900 XT will have a suggested price of $899, while the RX 7900 XTX should go for $999. Actual retail prices will depend on demand.
AMD has said gamers should expect a 1.7 times performance improvement over its previous flagship graphics card in certain games at a 4K resolution. If we take that to mean that, under the best-case scenario, the RX 7900 XTX will beat the last-gen RX 6950 XT by 70%, then based on Tom's Hardware's latest performance benchmarks, AMD's new top-tier graphics card should be in the same ballpark as Nvidia's RTX 4090.
Of course, these claims come from AMD, so they need to be taken with a grain of salt. What gamers actually experience across a range of titles will vary. Given the pricing, Nvidia will likely retain the performance crown. However, the price-to-performance crown may very well be a lopsided victory for AMD, given that Nvidia's graphics cards are so much more expensive. Third-party reviews in the lead-up to the launch will shed some light on real-world performance.
A tough market
Demand for high-end graphics cards is hard to predict in the current environment. PC sales are tumbling, down nearly 20% year over year in the third quarter. Economic uncertainty and elevated inflation are taking a toll on consumers. A new gaming PC is probably not a top priority for many.
Graphics card prices have come down dramatically over the past few months as undersupply has yielded to oversupply, with demand from cryptocurrency miners essentially vanishing. One problem AMD and Nvidia may run into, especially once they start launching mainstream graphics cards in the coming months, is an excess of last-gen cards on the market. Price cuts to move that inventory would make last-gen cards more attractive, possibly cutting into demand for new cards.
AMD's graphics revenue sank in the third quarter, although the gaming segment grew, thanks to strong demand for the chips that power the major game consoles. The company doesn't expect the gaming segment to grow in the fourth quarter, meaning the graphics business will likely deteriorate further. As both Nvidia and AMD fill out their lineups of new graphics cards next year, they may be fighting over a shrinking pie, at least until the market normalizes.

2022-11-11 00:00:00+00:00,Previewing Retail Sector Earnings as Inventory Issues Linger,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/previewing-retail-sector-earnings-as-inventory-issues-linger,"Walmart WMT shares have recouped a big part of the losses they suffered following the disappointing April-quarter results on May 17th. The Walmart sell-off was reinforced by an even more disappointing release from Target TGT the following day.
Unlike the market’s indiscriminate negative reaction to Walmart and Target’s quarterly reports in May, it reacted favorably to Walmart’s July-quarter release on August 16th even though Target shares sold off on its quarterly report the following day.
This recent history is useful to keep in mind as we look ahead to the October-quarter reports from Walmart and Target on Tuesday (11/15) and Wednesday (11/16), respectively.
The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Walmart (blue line) and Target (red line) shares relative to the S&P 500 index (green line).

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Part of the explanation for Walmart’s stock market stability is the nature of its business which offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart also benefits from its perceived value proposition to customers that likely prompts segments of consumers to ‘trade down’ to its stores.
The big issue in the last two quarterly releases for Walmart and Target centered on rising inventory levels, which reflected the combined effects of shifting consumer behavior and moderating sales. The market seems to believe, based on its treatment of the two stocks, that Walmart is further along in addressing its inventory issue than Target.
We have no reason to disprove the market’s optimism about Walmart on the inventory issue, but we can nevertheless see the stock as vulnerable to any signs of weakness in this week’s quarterly report. On the flip side, Target shares appear ‘spring loaded’ for a bounce if the company’s release Wednesday morning turns out to be ‘less bad’ than the market fears.
With respect to the Retail sector 2022 Q3 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 21 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. The Retail sector companies that have reported already are digital vendors like Amazon or restaurant operators like McDonald’s.
Unlike the official S&P sector classifications that leaves retail sector players spread around different sectors, primarily Consumer Discretionary, Zacks’ stand-alone Retail sector classification that houses conventional retailers, digital players and restaurants allows for a more granular understanding of trends in the space.
Total Q3 earnings for these retailers are down -5.8% from the same period last year on +10.4% higher revenues, with 71.4% beating EPS estimates and 52.4% beating revenue estimates.
The comparison charts below put the Q3 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
As you can see above, retailers have been struggling to come out with positive surprises thus far, with the trend particularly notable on the revenues side.
With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, Amazon’s weak numbers play a significant role in the year-over-year growth rate for the sector (Amazon is part of the Zacks Retail sector, and not the Zacks Technology sector).
The two comparison charts below show the Q3 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).

This Week’s Reporting Docket
We have more than 350 companies on deck to report results this week, including 15 S&P 500 members. Notable companies reporting this week, aside from a host of traditional retailers, include Nvidia NVDA, Cisco Systems CSCO, Applied Materials AMAT and others.
Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard
Including all of the results that came out through Friday, November 11th, we now have Q3 results from 461 S&P 500 members that combined account for 92.2% of the index’s total membership.
For the 461 index members that have reported results already, total earnings are up +2.6% from the same period last year on +12.4% higher revenues, with 69.4% beating EPS estimates and 67.9% beating revenue estimates.
Here is how the 2022 Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates for these companies compare across different periods.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Here is how the 2022 Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these companies compare across different periods.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The EPS and revenue beats percentages are below what we had seen from this same group of companies in recent quarters, but otherwise within the historical range by now.
Tracking Earnings Estimate Revisions
The chart below that shows the blended earnings and revenue growth for 2022 Q3 relative to what we saw in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
This is no surprise, as the global economy is going through a synchronized slowdown, under the combined effects of rising interest rates in response to inflationary pressures, still-lingering logistical challenges that have started to ease up and China’s continuing zero-Covid restrictions.
The orange bars in the chart above represent revenue growth. So, for 2022 Q3, revenues are on track to grow +11.4% from the same period last year even though earnings are only expected to be up +1.5%. This seemingly elevated revenue growth is a direct function of pricing power, with companies able to pass on rising input costs to end consumers. We intuitively know that this can’t go on forever and current projections for the next three quarters bears out this intuition.
The above chart shows that earnings in the current period (2022 Q4) are expected to be -4.2% below the year-earlier level on +4.9% higher revenues. Estimates have been steadily coming down, in line with the trend that we saw ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Estimates for full-year 2023 have been coming down as well, with the negative revisions trend particularly notable on an ex-Energy basis. You can see this in the chart below that shows the aggregate 2023 earnings estimate on an ex-Energy basis.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Since mid-April, 2023 earnings estimates in the aggregate have come down by -8.1% for the S&P 500 index as a whole and -10.9% on an ex-Energy basis. The cuts to estimates have been particularly notable for the Tech (down -18.2% since mid-April), Construction (-22.3%), Retail (-18.4%), Industrial Products (-11.9%), Consumer Discretionary (-18.1%) and Aerospace (-12.0%).
The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
There are some in the market who think that 2023 earnings should be below the 2022 level instead of the current expected +3.5% growth simply because the U.S. economy is expected to go through a moderate recession.
I am not suggesting that 2023 earnings can’t be below the 2022 level; they can be and on current revisions trend are likely headed there. But it is wrong to expect moderate declines in ‘real’ GDP to automatically result in ‘nominal’ or non-inflation adjusted corporate earnings to also decline. Corporate revenues and earnings are ‘nominal’ values and will reflect the effects of inflation. Inflation is expected to come down in 2023, but nevertheless remain positive.

Walmart shares have recouped a big part of the losses they suffered following the disappointing April-quarter results on May 17th. The Walmart sell-off was reinforced by an even more disappointing release from Target the following day.
Unlike the market’s indiscriminate negative reaction to Walmart and Target’s quarterly reports in May, it reacted favorably to Walmart’s July-quarter release on August 16th even though Target shares sold off on its quarterly report the following day.
This recent history is useful to keep in mind as we look ahead to the October-quarter reports from Walmart and Target on Tuesday (11/15) and Wednesday (11/16), respectively.
Part of the explanation for Walmart’s stock market stability is the nature of its business which offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart also benefits from its perceived value proposition to customers that likely prompts segments of consumers to ‘trade down’ to its stores.
The big issue in the last two quarterly releases for Walmart and Target centered on rising inventory levels, which reflected the combined effects of shifting consumer behavior and moderating sales. The market seems to believe, based on its treatment of the two stocks, that Walmart is further along in addressing its inventory issue than Target.
We have no reason to disprove the market’s optimism about Walmart on the inventory issue, but we can nevertheless see the stock as vulnerable to any signs of weakness in this week’s quarterly report. On the flip side, Target shares appear ‘spring loaded’ for a bounce if the company’s release Wednesday morning turns out to be ‘less bad’ than the market fears.
With respect to the Retail sector 2022 Q3 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 21 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. The Retail sector companies that have reported already are digital vendors like Amazon or restaurant operators like McDonald’s.
Unlike the official S&P sector classifications that leaves retail sector players spread around different sectors, primarily Consumer Discretionary, Zacks’ stand-alone Retail sector classification that houses conventional retailers, digital players and restaurants allows for a more granular understanding of trends in the space.
Total Q3 earnings for these retailers are down -5.8% from the same period last year on +10.4% higher revenues, with 71.4% beating EPS estimates and 52.4% beating revenue estimates.
Retailers have been struggling to come out with positive surprises thus far, with the trend particularly notable on the revenues side.
With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, Amazon’s weak numbers play a significant role in the year-over-year growth rate for the sector (Amazon is part of the Zacks Retail sector, and not the Zacks Technology sector).
This Week’s Reporting Docket
We have more than 350 companies on deck to report results this week, including 15 S&P 500 members. Notable companies reporting this week, aside from a host of traditional retailers, include Nvidia, Cisco Systems, Applied Materials and others.
Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard
Including all of the results that came out through Friday, November 11th, we now have Q3 results from 461 S&P 500 members that combined account for 92.2% of the index’s total membership.
For the 461 index members that have reported results already, total earnings are up +2.6% from the same period last year on +12.4% higher revenues, with 69.4% beating EPS estimates and 67.9% beating revenue estimates.
The EPS and revenue beats percentages are below what we had seen from this same group of companies in recent quarters, but otherwise within the historical range by now.
Tracking Earnings Estimate Revisions
The global economy is going through a synchronized slowdown, under the combined effects of rising interest rates in response to inflationary pressures, still-lingering logistical challenges that have started to ease up and China’s continuing zero-Covid restrictions.
The orange bars in the chart above represent revenue growth. So, for 2022 Q3, revenues are on track to grow +11.4% from the same period last year even though earnings are only expected to be up +1.5%. This seemingly elevated revenue growth is a direct function of pricing power, with companies able to pass on rising input costs to end consumers. We intuitively know that this can’t go on forever and current projections for the next three quarters bears out this intuition.
Earnings in the current period (2022 Q4) are expected to be -4.2% below the year-earlier level on +4.9% higher revenues. Estimates have been steadily coming down, in line with the trend that we saw ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season.
Estimates for full-year 2023 have been coming down as well, with the negative revisions trend particularly notable on an ex-Energy basis.
Since mid-April, 2023 earnings estimates in the aggregate have come down by -8.1% for the S&P 500 index as a whole and -10.9% on an ex-Energy basis. The cuts to estimates have been particularly notable for the Tech (down -18.2% since mid-April), Construction (-22.3%), Retail (-18.4%), Industrial Products (-11.9%), Consumer Discretionary (-18.1%) and Aerospace (-12.0%).
There are some in the market who think that 2023 earnings should be below the 2022 level instead of the current expected +3.5% growth simply because the U.S. economy is expected to go through a moderate recession.
I am not suggesting that 2023 earnings can’t be below the 2022 level; they can be, and current revision trends are likely headed there. But it is wrong to expect moderate declines in ‘real’ GDP to automatically result in ‘nominal’ or non-inflation adjusted corporate earnings to also decline. Corporate revenues and earnings are ‘nominal’ values and will reflect the effects of inflation. Inflation is expected to come down in 2023, but nevertheless remain positive.

2022-11-16 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Shares Fell Ahead of Earnings Today,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-shares-fell-ahead-of-earnings-today,"What happened
Shares of semiconductor maker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were dropping today ahead of the fiscal 2023 third-quarter earnings it will report after the closing bell on Wednesday. Nvidia shares fell nearly 5% earlier in the day, and were still lower by 3.4% as of 2:41 p.m. ET.
So what
The drop isn't just due to the uncertainty surrounding that earnings report, though. The semiconductor sector overall is in the red today after Micron Technology announced that weaker demand has reduced its chip production plans by 20%. Investors might also be unsure what to expect from Nvidia later today, and some of the selling could be due to thinking that the more than 40% rise in its shares over the last month was too much, too fast.
Now what
Expectations are mixed for Nvidia, partly due to the previously announced license requirements imposed by the U.S. government that restrict some semiconductor chips from being sold in China. Nvidia initially said that could hurt sales in its quarterly period ended Oct. 31, 2022, by as much as $400 million.
But Nvidia could exceed expectations since earlier this month it introduced its new A800 data center offering that isn't limited by the U.S. export restrictions. The company said the new chip went into production in its third quarter.
Nvidia also announced a new partnership with Microsoft today that it might expound upon in its report tonight. The multiyear project will be ""to build one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in the world,"" according to the company. It will combine Microsoft's cloud computing infrastructure with Nvidia's graphics, networking, and artificial intelligence (AI) software to help businesses expand AI technologies.
Investors are selling Nvidia shares today after Micron's announcement, but some might also be guessing what the company will say about its China business after the bell today. That's not a way to invest for the long term, but some may just feel it prudent to take some money off the table after the stock's sharp rise over the last month.

Undervalued stocks are those that trade for less than their intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is the fundamental value of a security, which includes both its underlying assets and earnings power. Undervalued stocks are often out of favor with the market and may be overlooked by investors.
However, they can provide an opportunity for long-term growth. Undervalued stocks may be underpriced due to a number of factors, including temporary financial difficulties, negative press, or investor pessimism. As a result, they may offer a good value for the price.
For example, a stock that is trading at $50 per share may have an intrinsic value of $100 per share. This creates a margin of safety that can protect against downside risk. Undervalued stocks can be difficult to find, but they may be worth the effort for investors who are looking for long-term growth potential.
What Are Semiconductor Stocks?
Semiconductor stocks are a broad category of stocks that includes companies that manufacture, design, or sell semiconductor products. They’re essential for everything from computers to solar panels to TVs. And because they’re found in so many different devices, semiconductor stocks tend to be very sensitive to changes in the global economy. When demand is high, their stocks go up. But when demand slows down, their stocks can drop very quickly.
So if you’re thinking about investing in semiconductor stocks, it’s important to do your research and understand the risks. But if you’re willing to take on some risk, semiconductor stocks can offer the potential for sizable rewards. Considering this, let’s take a look at two top semiconductor stocks to watch in the stock market today.

2022-11-22 00:00:00+00:00,3 Under-the-Radar Gaming Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-under-the-radar-gaming-stocks-you-can-buy-and-hold-for-the-next-decade-0,"Along with the rest of the tech world, gaming companies have suffered from macroeconomic declines that have stunted consumer spending in 2022. As a result, multiple companies in the industry have experienced significant dips in their share prices since January. However, that doesn't mean many of these companies aren't excellent stocks to add to your portfolio for the long term.
Considering the gaming industry is worth $195.65 billion and is expected to see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1% until at least 2030, according to Grand View Research, now might be the perfect time to invest in the market.
Here are three of the best under-the-radar gaming stocks you can buy at bargain prices and sit back while they rise over the long term.
1. Nvidia
With nearly 80% market share in the graphics processing unit (GPU) industry, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become a dominating player in PC gaming. Its GPUs power millions of gaming PCs worldwide, providing the top-tier graphics necessary to run the world's most intensive games. The company has been one of the hardest hit this year, with its stock plunging 49% year to date.
Its 2022 declines were primarily fueled by sharp reductions in consumer spending in the PC market. However, Nvidia has an excellent outlook over the long term, thanks to its efforts to diversify its business.
In addition to GPU sales, the company partnered with Nintendo in 2017 to power its Switch game console with Nividia's system on a chip. As of Sept. 30, the Nintendo Switch had sold 114.33 million units, making it one of the best-selling consoles in history.
Considering Nintendo is known to be working on the next-generation Switch, which it could reveal as early as 2023, Nvidia is in a prime position to receive a sustained boost to revenue from console sales for the next several years.
Moreover, Nvidia's data center business has become incredibly promising over the last few years. Along with the segment's revenue rising 30% year over year to $3.8 billion in its latest quarter, a recent partnership with Microsoft's cloud computing platform Azure to build a new supercomputer could go a long way in terms of sustained revenue growth.
As a result, Nvidia's long-term outlook makes it an excellent under-the-radar gaming stock worth an investment.
2. Corsair Gaming
Just last month, Corsair Gaming (NASDAQ: CRSR) had looked like a beaten-down casualty of the stock market sell-off in 2022, with its shares down over 40% year to date in the first week of October. However, the company's stock has risen 35% since Nov. 3 after posting glowing Q3 2022 earnings.
The company, best known for its premium PC gaming accessories such as mice, keyboards, headsets, and PC cases, saw revenue of $311.77 million in its third quarter, a year-over-year decline of 20.3%. However, the figure beat Wall Street expectations by $4.65 million, which prompted the rally.
The company is largely dependent on the GPU market, as the more gaming PCs being built, the more Corsair accessories sold. Corsair suffered from GPU shortages in the first half of the year, but a recent influx in availability, a sharp decline in pricing, and new offerings from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel could provide the company a boost to revenue going forward.
Additionally, Corsair moved into the gaming laptop market this year with its A1600 Voyager premium streaming notebook, developed in partnership with AMD. The company hasn't released sales figures for the device, but a venture into the $18.4 billion market, expected to see a CAGR of about 4.5%, is promising.
3. Warner Bros. Discovery
While Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) is not often thought of as a gaming company, known more for its film and TV offerings, the entertainment titan is home to some top-rated game franchises. In 2022 alone, the company released LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, MultiVersus, and Gotham Knights, with a promising slate for 2023.
The company has suffered a tumultuous year, with its stock plummeting 57% year to date as an expensive merger and restructuring costs ate into its earnings. However, Warner Bros. Discovery's average 12-month price target of $20.74, 92% above its current price, suggests the company is worth watching closely.
In terms of games, the company has seen significant gains this year. In Q2 2022, Warner Bros. Discovery's content revenue rose 3% to $2.6 billion, which the company primarily attributed to high gaming revenue from the release of LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. Additionally, its launch of the online game MultiVersus has been a hit, reaching 20 million players in August after launching on July 19.
With the highly anticipated launches of games such as Harry Potter-themed Hogwarts Legacy in February 2023 and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League in late 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery could be in for healthy growth in its gaming business. Along with a price-to-earnings ratio of 12.10 as of Nov. 18, now might be an excellent time to invest in the entertainment company.

2022-11-23 00:00:00+00:00,Is Nuveen ESG LargeCap Growth ETF (NULG) a Strong ETF Right Now?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-nuveen-esg-largecap-growth-etf-nulg-a-strong-etf-right-now-3,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Growth category of the market, the Nuveen ESG LargeCap Growth ETF (NULG) is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 12/13/2016.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.
Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
Non-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics.
While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
Because the fund has amassed over $835.42 million, this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Growth. NULG is managed by Nuveen. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the TIAA ESG USA Large-Cap Growth Index.
The TIAA ESG USA Large-Cap Growth Index is comprised of equity securities of large capitalization companies listed on US exchanges & meet ESG criteria & exhibit overall growth style characteristics based on long-term forward EPS growth rate, short-term forward EPS growth rate, current internal growth rate, long-term historical EPS growth trend & long-term historical sales per share growth trend.
Cost & Other Expenses
For ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
NULG's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 0.28%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
ETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 43.20% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) accounts for about 12.12% of total assets, followed by Tesla Inc (TSLA) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA).
Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 37.31% of NULG's total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF has lost about -25.65% so far this year and is down about -25.28% in the last one year (as of 11/23/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $45 and $72.70.
The ETF has a beta of 1.10 and standard deviation of 28.10% for the trailing three-year period. With about 97 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
Nuveen ESG LargeCap Growth ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Growth segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.
IShares ESG Aware MSCI EAFE ETF (ESGD) tracks MSCI EAFE ESG Focus Index and the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ESGU) tracks MSCI USA ESG Focus Index. IShares ESG Aware MSCI EAFE ETF has $6.75 billion in assets, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF has $20.51 billion. ESGD has an expense ratio of 0.20% and ESGU charges 0.15%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Growth.

Nov 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks tumbled on Monday as protests in major Chinese cities against strict COVID-19 policies sparked concerns about economic growth, while Apple Inc AAPL.Oslid on worries about a hit to iPhone production.
Shares of the Cupertino, California tech giant fell over 2% and weighed heavily on the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX index as worker unrest at the world's biggest iPhone factory in China fanned fears of a deeper hit to the already constrained production of higher-end phones.
Rare protests in major Chinese cities over the weekend against the country's strict zero-COVID curbs are exacerbating worries about growth in the world's second-largest economy.
""These protests are just evidence that this is a kind of a moving target where, will China continue to try to really constrain COVID's spread?"" said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.
""Or will they have more of a 'living with COVID' approach that we've seen in the United States and other countries?""
""We think COVID itself and China's policy is one of the key variables for 2023 that would influence stock prices and investors,"" Hainlin said.
All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes declined, led by real estate .SPLRCR, down 2%, followed by a 1.91% loss in energy .SPNY.
U.S. shares of Pinduoduo Inc PDD.O surged 14% after the Chinese e-commerce platform beat estimates for third-quarter revenue, helped by COVID-related lockdowns in the country that forced consumers to shop online. U.S. shares of other Chinese technology companies also rose, with Baidu 9888.HKand Tencent Holdings 0700.HKeach gaining over 2%.
In afternoon trading, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 1.20% at 3,977.86 points.
The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC declined 1.15% to 11,097.71 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 1.15% at 33,953.73 points.
Shares of Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O rose about 1% after an industry report estimated spending during Cyber Monday, the biggest U.S. online shopping day, would rise to as much as $11.6 billion.
Trading was mixed in other heavyweight growth stocks, including Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Meta Platforms Inc META.O, Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Tesla Inc TSLA.O.
Biogen Inc BIIB.Ofell3.5% following a report of death during a clinical study of its experimental Alzheimer's drug.
Shares of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related companies Coinbase Global Inc COIN.O, Riot Blockchain Inc RIOT.O and Marathon Digital Holdings Inc MARA.Oeach fell more than 2% following lender BlockFi's bankruptcy filing, the latest casualty since FTX's collapse earlier this month.
This week, investors will keep a close watch on November consumer confidence data, due on Tuesday; the government's second estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product, due on Wednesday; and November nonfarm payrolls due on Friday.
Declining stocks outnumbered rising ones within the S&P 500 .AD.SPXby a 7.7-to-one ratio.
The S&P 500 posted 11 new highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 75 new highs and 120 new lows.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2022-11-30 00:00:00+00:00,US STOCKS-Wall Street ends sharply higher after Powell comments,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-street-ends-sharply-higher-after-powell-comments-1,"By Noel Randewich and Shreyashi Sanyal
Nov 30 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank might scale back the pace of its interest rate hikes as soon as December.
The S&P 500 rallied and closed above its 200 day moving average for the first time since April after the release of Powell's remarks prepared for delivery at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington.
Powell also cautioned that the fight against inflation was far from over and that key questions remain unanswered, including how high rates will ultimately need to rise and for how long.
""(The market) has waited with bated breath, looking for that clarification in terms of duration and extent of Fed tightening. And anything that gives hope to the idea the Fed is becoming less hawkish is viewed as a positive for stocks, at least on a short-term basis,"" said Chuck Carlson, Chief Executive Officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.
Bets that the Fed will reduce the size of its rate hikes, as well as recent data pointing to a mild cooling in inflation, led the benchmark S&P 500 index .SPX to its second straight month of gains.
The CME FedWatch Tool showed futures traders seeing a 75% chance that the Fed will raise interest rates by 50 basis points at its December meeting, up from a 65% chance before Powell's comments were released. The FedWatch tool now shows a 25% chance of a 75 basis point increase.
Nvidia NVDA.O rallied more than 8%, Microsoft MSFT.O jumped 6.2% and Apple AAPL.O climbed 4.9%.
Tesla Inc's TSLA.O shares surged 7.7% after China Merchants Bank International said Tesla's sales in China in November were boosted by price cuts and incentives offered on its Model 3 and Model Y.
The S&P 500 climbed 3.09% to end the session at 4,079.97 points.
The Nasdaq gained 4.41% to 11,468.00 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.18% to 34,589.24 points.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX surged 5.85%, trimming its loss in 2022 to about 28%.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was heavy, with 15.0 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 11.1 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.
For November, the S&P 500 climbed 5.4%, the Dow added 5.7% and the Nasdaq increased 4.4%.
An ADP National Employment report showed private employment increased by 127,000 in November, below expectations of 200,000 jobs, suggesting demand for labor was cooling amid high interest rates.
""The ADP employment number not meeting expectations fits into the narrative that the Fed will have room and start slowing down its rate hikes, and that definitely benefits interest rate sensitive assets,"" said Keith Buchanan, a portfolio manager at Globalt in Atlanta.
The Labor Department's closely watched nonfarm payrolls data is due on Friday. A report showed U.S. job openings falling to 10.334 million in October, against 10.687 million in the prior month.
Another reading showed the U.S. economy rebounded more strongly than initially thought in the third quarter.
The S&P 500 remains down about 14% so far in 2022, while the Nasdaq index .IXIC has lost about 27%.
Biogen Inc BIIB.O jumped 4.7% after its experimental Alzheimer's drug slowed cognitive decline in a closely watched trial.
Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 .AD.SPX by a 24.1-to-one ratio.
The S&P 500 posted 24 new highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq recorded 117 new highs and 167 new lows.

2022-12-01 00:00:00+00:00,TSMC plans to make more advanced chips in US on Apple's push - Bloomberg News,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tsmc-plans-to-make-more-advanced-chips-in-us-on-apples-push-bloomberg-news,"Adds response from TSMC
Dec 1 (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW will offer advanced 4-nanometer chips when its new $12-billion plant in Arizona opens in 2024, spurred by U.S. customers including Apple Inc AAPL.O to do so, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.
TSMC is expected to announce the new plan when U.S. President Joe Biden and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo visit Phoenix for a ceremony next Tuesday, according to the report, citing people familiar with the matter.
TSMC previously said it would make 20,000 wafers per month at the Arizona facility but the production may increase from those original plans, the report said. Apple will use about a third of the output as production gets underway, it added.
The report said in addition to Apple, TSMC customers including Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O have also asked TSMC to make more sophisticated chips at the Arizona plant.
TSMC's customers have asked the company to roll out its latest technologies simultaneously in the United States and Taiwan, the report added.
TSMC declined to comment, while Apple, AMD and Nvidia did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Last week, TSMC founder Morris Chang said the company was planning to produce chips with advanced 3-nanometre technology in Arizona, but added that the plans were not yet finalised.

2022-12-02 00:00:00+00:00,My 3 Highest-Conviction Growth Stocks to Buy Before 2022 Ends,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/my-3-highest-conviction-growth-stocks-to-buy-before-2022-ends,"Much of last year was dominated by a global pandemic, so coming out of 2021, investors couldn't have possibly predicted the challenges that were ahead. Now, just 12 months later, supply chain bottlenecks helped fuel 40-year-high inflation, the highest interest rates in nearly 15 years, and the worst bear market in more than a decade. Sheesh.
As a result of the economic overhang, many former high-flying stocks have fallen on hard times. Yet, for those who view the glass as half full, investors are presented with the rare opportunity to buy these high-quality companies at discounted prices.
When opportunities abound, it can be difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. To make things easier, let's narrow down the field and look at three businesses that have all the earmarks of a stock ready to run: an industry-leading position, significant secular tailwinds, and a large addressable market.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Shopify: The death of e-commerce has been greatly exaggerated
After its public debut in mid-2015, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) quickly rose to prominence as the leading provider of software-as-a-service (SaaS) tools to facilitate digital retail for merchants.
After several years of unbridled growth and lockdown-fueled gains, however, the e-commerce platform has experienced a reversal of fortunes. Difficult comps, a slowing of online spending, and persistent inflation have resulted in growth that has slowed to a crawl. Investors would be forgiven for thinking that Shopify's best days might be behind it.
Yet even as e-commerce growth seems dead on the vine, there are still plenty of green shoots that suggest life is about to burst forth. Shopify reported record-breaking sales during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend, which grew 19% year over year and 21% in constant currency. Amazon also reported record-breaking sales, saying it was the company's ""biggest holiday shopping weekend ever."" With the world's largest digital retail platforms reporting record sales, it's unlikely that e-commerce has met an untimely demise.
There's more. E-commerce growth might have stalled temporarily, but the underlying secular tailwinds are picking up speed. The global e-commerce market is expected to surpass $3.3 trillion in 2022, rising to $5.4 trillion in 2026, according to Morgan Stanley.
Furthermore, Shopify estimates its total addressable market at $160 billion. When viewed in the context of its 2021 revenue of $4.6 billion, the untapped opportunity is clear.
2. Nvidia: Gaming is down but not out
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is best known for the graphics processing units (GPUs) that make digital images come to life in gaming, but recently players have delayed upgrading to the latest chips until macroeconomic conditions improve. As a result, in Nvidia's fiscal 2023 third quarter (ended Oct. 30), revenue grew just 3% year over year, dragged down by a 33% decline in sales of gaming chips.
But it isn't just Nvidia feeling the pain. PC and laptop shipments fell nearly 20% year over year in the third quarter, the market's steepest decline in more than two decades according to Gartner. But even in the midst of economic upheaval, Nvidia increased its lead, with a dominant 88% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, up from 80% in the second quarter.
And gaming is just the tip of the iceberg for the semiconductor specialist. Nvidia is also one of the leading providers of processors used by data centers and cloud computing to speed movement around the ether, and is the top choice of each of the world's leading cloud operators. As a result, data center revenue grew 31% year over year in the third quarter.
That's just the beginning. Nvidia generated record revenue of $26.9 billion last year, which is a drop in the ocean compared to its massive opportunity. Management believes its addressable market is a whopping $1 trillion, which helps illustrate the substantial runway ahead.
3. The Trade Desk: The flag bearer for digital advertising
In the realm of programmatic advertising, nobody holds a candle to The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD). The company's state-of-the-art adtech platform automates digital ad-buying in real time, helping marketers get more bang for their buck.
The Trade Desk is a pioneer in the field and continues to disrupt the status quo. The company built a broad coalition of the world's biggest advertisers, all of which have flocked to its Unified ID 2.0 -- the heir apparent to ad-tracking cookies, which are quickly going the way of the dinosaur. The Trade Desk also introduced OpenPath, which eliminates the intermediary and provides direct access to premium advertising inventory for those that use its platform.
To fully appreciate its position in the industry, let's compare The Trade Desk's recent results to its two biggest rivals. In the third quarter, digital advertising kingpin Alphabet grew revenue by just 6% year over year, while Meta Platforms revenue fell 4%. In contrast, revenue for The Trade Desk jumped 31%, helping to illustrate its clear advantage.
While estimates vary, global digital advertising spend is expected to grow from $521 billion in 2021 to more than $876 billion by 2026, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 11%, according to Oberlo. The Trade Desk's much higher growth rate shows that it's stealing market share from its rivals, which bodes well.
The Trade Desk generated revenue of $1.12 billion in 2021, which pales in comparison to its as-yet untapped opportunity. The global ad industry reached $772 billion in 2021, but is expected to top $1 trillion by 2026, giving The Trade Desk plenty of fertile fields to plow.
A word on valuation
It's important to note that all this potential comes at a price. Even as valuations have fallen significantly over the past year, none of these companies are cheap using traditional measures. The Trade Desk, Nvidia, and Shopify are selling at 14, 14, and 8 times next year's sales, respectively, when a reasonable price-to-sales ratio is typically between 1 and 2. However, given the combination of strong historic performance and significant future opportunity, it isn't surprising investors would award these stocks a premium valuation.
Those with the patience to let the recovery play out will be amply rewarded when the economy regains its footing, propelling these stocks skyward.

2022-12-05 00:00:00+00:00,Is Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (PSI) a Strong ETF Right Now?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-invesco-dynamic-semiconductors-etf-psi-a-strong-etf-right-now-5,"Making its debut on 06/23/2005, smart beta exchange traded fund Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (PSI) provides investors broad exposure to the Technology ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.
Market cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.
The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.
Fund Sponsor & Index
The fund is managed by Invesco, and has been able to amass over $506.34 million, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Technology ETFs. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index.
The Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index is comprised of stocks of semiconductor companies. The Index is designed to provide capital appreciation by thoroughly evaluating companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including fundamental growth, stock valuation, investment timeliness and risk factors.
Cost & Other Expenses
When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.
Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.55% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.
PSI's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 0.44%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 100% of the portfolio.
Looking at individual holdings, Qualcomm Inc (QCOM) accounts for about 5.42% of total assets, followed by Nvidia Corp (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD).

2022-12-06 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks to Buy Before 2023 That Can Set You Up for Life,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-buy-before-2023-that-can-set-you-up-for-life,"Given all the market uncertainty this year and the downward trend of the major indices, it's no surprise that some investors are hesitant to buy right now. Knowing the right time to pull the trigger on a stock purchase (or a sale) is often one of the hardest parts of being an investor.
What long-term investors should remember is that when you buy (or sell) is far less important than what you buy. If you are buying with the idea of holding the stock long-term, buying now or waiting until next year becomes much less important than making sure you pick a quality company. Still, this current market situation has created some buying opportunities at the moment that might not be as opportunistic next year if a market recovery takes hold.
Three such buy-now opportunities are Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX), Mattel (NASDAQ: MAT), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). All three are solid businesses with attractive growth prospects that can make them ideal buy-and-hold stocks. Let's take a closer look at their operations and see why these might be good investments to load up on right now.
1. Vertex Pharmaceuticals
Vertex Pharmaceuticals has been a beast this year, achieving impressive sales growth that's likely to continue into next year, even if the economy slows further. That's because the company has some fast-growing products related to the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) that help this business outperform the broader market.
In the third quarter, the company's product revenue of $2.3 billion was up 18% year over year, led by top-selling CF product Trikafta/Kaftrio, which brought in over $2 billion in sales on its own. Net income of $931 million was also up 9% year over year.
But Vertex has more than CF in its portfolio as the company collaborates with CRISPR Therapeutics. The two companies are working to get final approval of a gene-therapy treatment called exa-cel, which can be used to treat sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, a rare blood disorder. If approved, exa-cel has the potential to add billions in additional revenue. The companies expect that, by early next year, their rolling submission package to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the biologics licensing application for exa-cel will be complete.
At a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 20, based on analyst expectations, Vertex trades a little higher than the average healthcare stock, which investors are paying 17 times future profits for. But given that its growth story looks nowhere near over, Vertex is still a great buy today heading into 2023 and beyond.
2. Mattel
Toymaker Mattel has an impressive portfolio of billion-dollar toy brands that include Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price, and Barbie. The brands have been around for decades, and their popularity levels are unlikely to change anytime soon. The release of a Barbie live-action movie in 2023 is likely to provide a solid boost to the brand and some strong growth for Mattel.
Mattel's sales have proven to be resilient this year as net revenue of more than $4 billion through the first nine months is up 10% year over year, and that increases to 13% when factoring out the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Although rising costs have been a problem for many companies, Mattel's operating profit of nearly $600 million is up 26% this year.
With a robust business that's in solid shape today, it's hard not to like Mattel's stock, especially at its current valuation; down 16%, the stock trades at a forward P/E of only 10.
3. Nvidia
Shares of chipmaker Nvidia are down more than 45% this year as it has not been immune from the tech sell-off in 2022. The growth company is struggling of late as sales in its most recent quarter (for the period ending Oct. 30) totaled just $5.9 billion and were down 17% year over year. And for next quarter, revenue is only forecast to come in a bit higher at $6 billion.
Weak demand in the PC market, the downturn in the cryptocurrency markets, and restrictions on chip sales to the Chinese market are a couple of reasons why investors aren't bullish on the stock of late. The Chinese market as a whole isn't strong right now due to COVID-19-related lockdowns.
But these problems aren't long-term issues and over time should resolve. Buying amid pessimism and a reduced price could make now an opportune time to add Nvidia to your portfolio. Nvidia remains a top company in the chip world, and the softer results have made it look like a worse buy, trading at more than 70 times profits. But on a forward basis, the P/E multiple is at 39.
Admittedly, these valuations aren't all that cheap, but the stock is down close to 52% from its 52-week high. And with more growth still ahead for the business in an increasingly connected world, this could still be a solid stock to buy for the long haul. In fact, shares of Nvidia have already started to take off on better-than-expected economic data released in November.

2022-12-07 00:00:00+00:00,Apple To Use US-made Microchips From TSMC's New Arizona Factory,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-to-use-us-made-microchips-from-tsmcs-new-arizona-factory,"(RTTNews) - Apple Inc. plans to start using American-made processors from the new advanced chip factory in Phoenix, Arizona operated by chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., according to its Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook.
At an event in the factory in Arizona, which was attended by U.S. President Joe Biden, it was also announced that TSMC will invest $40 billion in the new factory, where chip companies AMD and Nvidia will also be first customers.
Cook said, ""The progress we've made with Apple Silicon has transformed our devices. … And now, thanks to the hard work of so many people, these chips can be proudly stamped 'Made in America.""
He also tweeted that Apple would be the site's largest customer.
The world's largest chipmaker said its new plant is expected to start producing 4 -nanometer or nm processors in 2024. The construction on a second factory in Phoenix will be started next year, to be ready by 2026, that will produce 3nm chips, the smallest and most complex processors currently available.
TSMC expects the two factories in Arizona to produce more than 600,000 wafers annually by 2026, which, according to White House officials, will be enough to meet the entire US demand for advanced chips.
TSMC reportedly plans to produce 2nm chips by 2025 in its overseas facilities mainly in Taiwan.
At present, TSMC produces the most advanced processors, including the chips in Apple's latest iPhones, iPads and Macs.
However, Apple has been struggling with issues in supply chain and the chip shortage amid the pandemic, which are said to have caused the tech major $6 billion in sales. The company recently announcced plans to buy more chips from Europe and US semiconductor fabrication plants to meet supply issues.
TSMC's factories in Arizona will be partially subsidized by the U.S. Government as per the CHIPS and Science Act, signed by Biden in August, which is a legislative package that contains $52 billion for domestic chip production.
Biden said at the event, ""These chips will power iPhones and MacBooks, as Tim Cook can attest. Apple had to buy all the advanced chips from overseas. Now we're going to do more of their supply chain here at home.""
Along with Biden and Cook, TSMC's ""tool-in"" ceremony, marking the arrival of production equipment to the first facility, was attended by TSMC founder Morris Chang and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, who said TSMC's investment to the U. S. is a masterstroke and a game changing development for the industry.

2022-12-08 00:00:00+00:00,"US STOCKS-S&P 500, Nasdaq snap losing streaks after jobless claims rise",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-sp-500-nasdaq-snap-losing-streaks-after-jobless-claims-rise,"By David French
Dec 8 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 .SPXended higher on Thursday, snapping a five-session losing streak, as investors interpreted data showing a rise in weekly jobless claims as a sign the pace of interest rate hikes could soon slow.
Wall Street's main indexes had come under pressure in recent days, with the S&P 500 shedding 3.6% since the beginning of December on expectations of a longer rate-hike cycle and downbeat economic views from some top company executives.
Such thinking had also weighed on the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC, which had posted four straight losing sessions prior to Thursday's advance on the tech-heavy index.
Stocks rose as investors cheered data showing the number of Americans filing claims for jobless benefits increased moderately last week, while unemployment rolls hit a 10-month high toward the end of November.
The report follows data last Friday that showed U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in November and increased wages, spurring fears that the Fed might stick to its aggressive stance to tame decades-high inflation.
Markets have been swayed by data releases in recent days, with investors lacking certainty ahead of Federal Reserve guidance next week on interest rates.
Such behavior means Friday's producer price index and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey will likely dictate whether Wall Street can build on Thursday's rally.
""The market has to adjust to the fact that we're moving from a stimulus-based economy - both fiscal and monetary - into a fundamentals-based economy, and that's what we're grappling with right now,"" said Wiley Angell, chief market strategist at Ziegler Capital Management.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 183.56 points, or 0.55%, to close at 33,781.48; the S&P 500 .SPX gained 29.59 points, or 0.75%, to finish at 3,963.51; and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 123.45 points, or 1.13%, at 11,082.00.
Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, led by a 1.6% gain in technology stocks .SPLRCT.
Most mega-cap technology and growth stocks gained. Apple Inc AAPL.O, Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O rose between 1.2% and 6.5%.
Microsoft Corp MSFT.O ended 1.2% higher, despite giving up some intraday gains after the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint aimed at blocking the tech giant's $69 billion bid to buy Activision Blizzard Inc ATVI.O. The ""Call of Duty"" games maker closed 1.5% lower.
The energy index .SPNY was an exception, slipping 0.5%, despite Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N gaining 0.7% after announcing it would expand its $30-billion share repurchase program. The sector had been under pressure in recent sessions as commodity prices slipped: U.S. crude CLc1 is now hovering near its level at the start of 2022.
Meanwhile, Moderna Inc MRNA.O advanced 3.2% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized COVID-19 shots from the vaccine maker that target both the original coronavirus and Omicron sub-variants for use in children as young as six months old.
The regulator also approved similar guidance for fellow COVID vaccine maker Pfizer Inc PFE.N, which rose 3.1%, and its partner BioNTech, whose U.S.-listed shares BNTX.O gained 5.6%.
Rent the Runway Inc RENT.Oposted its biggest ever one-day gain, jumping 74.3%, after the clothing rental firm raised its 2022 revenue forecast.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.07 billion shares, compared with the 10.90 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 232 new lows.

2022-12-12 00:00:00+00:00,2 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in 2023 and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-hand-over-fist-in-2023-and-1-to-avoid-like-the-plague,"It's been a difficult year for Wall Street and cyclical businesses. A historic shift in Federal Reserve monetary policy has sent interest rates rocketing higher at their fastest pace in decades. As a result, all three major U.S. stock indexes plunged into a bear market, with the probability of a recession in 2023 rising significantly.
Yet in spite of these near-term headwinds, the long-term outlook for the semiconductor industry remains bright. Based on a report from Fortune Business Insights, the global semiconductor industry is expected to more than double in size from $527.9 billion to $1.38 trillion between 2021 and 2029. This means chipmakers have the potential to be fantastic long-term investments.
Image source: Getty Images.
However, not all chipmakers are created equally. With the 2022 bear market reducing tech stock valuations, two semiconductor stocks stand out as no-brainer buys in 2023. Meanwhile, one of the most popular semis on the planet looks entirely avoidable in the new year.
Semiconductor stock No. 1 to buy hand over fist in 2023: Intel
The first chipmaker that's a surefire buy in 2023 is industry stalwart and Dow Jones Industrial Average component Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
As with most semiconductor companies, inflation and supply chain issues have taken their toll on Intel in 2022. But in addition to these concerns, Intel's share price has been weighed down by chief competitor Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) chipping away at its share of central processing units (CPUs) sold in personal computers, mobile devices, and data center servers. While these are all tangible headwinds, none of them are particularly concerning over the long term or at risk of derailing Intel's turnaround strategy.
Let's start by addressing the elephant in the room. Yes, AMD is taking market share from Intel and has been doing so for the past three years. While it would be ideal for Intel not to lose share to AMD, the important thing to note is that the percentage of share lost remains relatively small.
According to data from Mercury Research, AMD controlled 13.9% of the desktop CPU market in the third quarter and 17.5% of data center server share. That means Intel still accounts for greater than 80% in these categories. In other words, these segments will continue to be cash cows for Intel.
Another important growth driver for Intel is its foundry segment. Earlier this year, the company broke ground on two chip-manufacturing plants in Ohio that come with an aggregate price tag of $20 billion. What's worth noting is that President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law in August. This law provides almost $53 billion to the semiconductor industry in subsidies for manufacturing facilities and various research grants. This certainly incentivizes Intel to bolster its domestic production capacity.
Lastly, don't overlook autonomous vehicle company Mobileye Global, which Intel acquired for $15.3 billion in 2017. Mobileye debuted via initial public offering in late October and now carries a $25.5 billion market cap. More importantly, Intel remains the majority shareholder of a company (Mobileye) that grew sales by 38% in a challenging third quarter.
With its share price cut in half in less than three years, Intel is ripe for the picking by opportunistic investors.
Semiconductor stock No. 2 to buy hand over fist in 2023: Broadcom
The second semiconductor stock investors can confidently buy hand over fist in 2023 is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO).
The chief concern among Broadcom skeptics appears to be the growing likelihood that a recession will reduce chip demand for Broadcom and perhaps shrink its backlog. Even if this outcome were to materialize, it would be a short-term speed bump for a company with a mountain of catalysts.
The biggest driver for Broadcom is the 5G revolution. For much of the past decade, wireless download speeds weren't meaningfully improved. But with telecom companies steadily upgrading their wireless infrastructure, 5G speeds are now a reality. This means an ongoing device upgrade cycle for consumers and businesses should take place through mid-decade. Broadcom generates most of its revenue from selling wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones.
Something else to add to the above is that owning a smartphone and having wireless access have evolved into basic necessities. Not even a recession would be likely to cause a significant uptick in wireless service cancellations.
Broadcom's backlog is also a positive. The company entered fiscal 2022 (the company's fiscal year ends in late October) with a record $14.9 billion worth of orders and, according to CEO Hock Tan, was booking orders well into 2023. If the U.S. economy were to slow in the upcoming year, Broadcom would be able to lean on its backlog to ensure anywhere from 12 to 24 months of highly predictable operating cash flow.
Want another reason to be excited about Broadcom? Look to its data center operations. As more businesses shift their data into the cloud in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for access and connectivity chips used in data center servers should grow. There's a real chance this ancillary operating segment could outpace wireless chip growth in smartphones.
Income investors are going to love Broadcom as well. Since 2010, Broadcom's quarterly payout has grown by almost 6,500% to $4.60. This works out to a 3.5% yield for a fast-growing company currently valued at just 13 times Wall Street's forecast earnings in 2023.

The semiconductor stock to avoid like the plague in 2023: Nvidia
But not every semiconductor stock can be a winner. Although it's been one of the top chipmakers to have in your portfolio for well over a decade, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) can be comfortably left on the shelf in 2023.
To be perfectly clear, I'm in no way saying Nvidia is a stock to forever avoid. There are certainly catalysts that merited Nvidia's greater than 8,000% return since the Great Recession bottom in March 2009. In particular, Nvidia accounts for close to 20% of the global graphics processing unit (GPU) market and approximately 80% of discrete graphics cards, which are GPUs operating separately from the processor. GPUs account for the lion's share of Nvidia's profits.
However, one of the biggest issues for the company is that many of its fast-growing segments have absolutely hit a wall. For instance, cryptocurrency valuations have tanked since November 2021. When the value of digital currencies declines, demand for GPUs to mine cryptocurrency tends to fall in lockstep. To boot, non-fungible token (NFT) transactions have fallen off a cliff, thereby minimizing demand for metaverse innovations and blockchain-based gaming. That's not particularly good news for the company's Omniverse Platform.
Nvidia's gaming segment has also gone from boom to bust in the blink of an eye. With the pandemic seemingly put in the rearview mirror in a number of developed countries, people aren't spending as much time gaming at home anymore. When coupled with a weakening U.S. economic outlook, we've seen gaming revenue plunge from $3.62 billion in the company's fiscal first quarter of 2023 to just $1.57 billion in the fiscal third quarter.
Nvidia is also facing headwinds in the world's No. 2 economy, China. In September, the U.S. ordered chipmakers to halt exports of advanced microchips to China. Although Nvidia has developed a slower GPU that meets the new export guidelines, it's uncertain if this slower GPU will generate the same revenue as the faster A100 GPU. The potential loss of revenue from China could be significant.
Finally, Nvidia's valuation hasn't properly accounted for all of the macroeconomic and company-specific headwinds it's contending with. Despite its share price halving since hitting an all-time high on Nov. 22, 2021, Nvidia commands a forward-year price-to-earnings ratio of 40. That's incredibly rich for a company with no forecast sales growth in fiscal 2023 and perhaps high-single-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2024, assuming the U.S. doesn't enter a recession.
With so many other phenomenal deals to choose from in the tech space, Nvidia becomes an easy semiconductor stock to avoid in 2023.

2022-12-13 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Nvidia, Shopify, and The Trade Desk Stocks All Rallied on Tuesday",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-shopify-and-the-trade-desk-stocks-all-rallied-on-tuesday,"What happened
A broad cross-section of stocks roared higher on Tuesday, as market watchers focused on the Federal Reserve Bank's ongoing battle to cool red-hot inflation. The latest U.S. government data showed that inflation cooled somewhat last month, which could convince the Fed to alter the pace and tenor of its campaign of interest rate hikes, which are designed to battle inflation.
With that as a backdrop, shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) climbed 1.5%, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) rose 1.2%, and The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) jumped 3.8%, as of 12:49 p.m. ET.
A check of all the usual sources uncovered very little in the way of company-specific news fueling the rally, which suggests investors were primarily fixated on the improving economic data.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly inflation data for November and the report held good news for consumers and investors alike. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most widely followed measure of inflation, rose 7.1% in November compared to the year-ago period, while edging just 0.1% higher month over month.
While still high by historical standards, inflation actually improved compared to October's read of 7.7%, while also notching its lowest rate since December 2021. This was better than economist's forecasts of 7.3%. The ""core"" data, which excludes extremely volatile food and energy prices, climbed 6% year over year, also lower than the 6.1% predicted by economists.
Not all the news was good. The food and energy indexes both increased, climbing to 10.6% and 13.1%, respectively, which helps illustrate the challenges that remain.
Several improving reads on the economy in recent weeks make it more likely that the Fed can ease up on the pace of interest rate hikes, or potentially lower the rate of its increases. The Fed uses interest rates in an attempt to cool rising inflation. When borrowing is more expensive, consumers and businesses tend to spend less. This results in slowing demand, which in turn causes prices to fall. However, given the complexity of the economy, the process is more art than science. The Fed is trying to slow an overheated economy without slowing it too quickly, for fear of pushing the country into recession.
There was one piece of company-specific news, specifically regarding The Trade Desk. Citi analyst Ygal Arounian initiated coverage of The Trade Desk with a buy rating and $60 price target, which represents potential upside of roughly 22% compared to Monday's closing price. The analyst noted that much of the challenging macro environment is already reflected in the share price, resulting in a positive risk/reward going into 2023.
Now what
While investors are celebrating now, it's important to remember the prevailing attitude, which is typically ""what have you done for me lately?"" This means it could only take one negative economic report for stocks to resume their year-long retreat.
Furthermore, the current macroeconomic environment still presents challenges for this trio of companies:
Nvidia has already seen a significant decline in demand for its high-end graphics processing units (GPUs), as consumers are putting off upgrading to the latest and greatest semiconductors used for gaming.
Consumers are lowering discretionary spending, which could mean fewer purchases on e-commerce sites powered by Shopify.
Marketing budgets are getting the ax in response to economic uncertainty, which will weigh on The Trade Desk's adtech platform.
However, for those who like to view the glass as half-full, there's a rosier perspective. Bear markets tend to take down good and bad companies alike. As a result, each of these stocks is selling for a significant discount to the prices of just a year ago, making their valuations much more compelling. This gives investors an opportunity to pick up these stocks at discounted prices, though none are cheap in terms of traditional valuation metrics.
Nvidia, The Trade Desk, and Shopify are currently selling for 15 times, 13 times, and 7 times next year's sales, when a reasonable price-to-sales ratio is between 1 and 2. However, these valuations are near all-time lows and investors tend to reward companies with a history of strong growth and robust prospects with a premium valuation.
For investors with the appropriate three-to-five-year investing time horizon and a stomach for a little volatility, buying shares of these industry leaders while they're on sale will seem like a genius move years from now.

NEW YORK, Dec 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes closed sharply lower on Thursday, with each of the major averages suffering their biggest daily percentage drop in weeks, as fears intensified that the Federal Reserve's battle against inflation using aggressive interest rate hikes could lead to a recession.
The U.S. central bank hiked rates by 50 basis points (bps) on Wednesday as was widely expected, downsizing from the consecutive 75 bps hikes at its prior four meetings, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned recent signs of inflation were not enough to convince Fed the battle against rising prices had been won.
The Fed projected continued rate hikes to above 5% in 2023, a level not seen since a steep economic downturn in 2007.
""It is not just what they did but what they said, and it certainly does seem like they are still worried about inflation and this is not going to be the end of the rate increases,"" said Melissa Brown, global head of applied research at Qontigo in New York.
""It really is hard to see what is going to turn things back around until we start seeing more data - which could be earnings, which could be the next inflation print or the Fed statement next year. The good news is it’s almost next year.""
Adding to global recession worries, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank further indicated an extended hiking cycle on Thursday. Most major central banks have followed a rate hike strategy in an attempt to reign in inflation.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 764.13 points, or 2.25%, to 33,202.22; the S&P 500 .SPX lost 99.57 points, or 2.49%, to 3,895.75; and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 360.36 points, or 3.23%, to 10,810.53.
The declines marked the biggest one-day percentage drops for the S&P and Nasdaq since Nov. 2, and largest for the Dow since Sept. 13. Each closed at its lowest level since Nov. 9.
Equities have rallied since hitting lows for the year in mid-October, as signs of cooling inflation sparked optimism that the end of the Fed's rate hike path could be on the horizon. But the rally has fizzled in December as investors see mixed economic data and a resolute Fed as having increased the chances of a recession.
Money market participants expect at least two 25 bps rate hikes next year and borrowing costs to peak at about 4.9% by midyear, before falling to around 4.4% by the end of 2023. FEDWATCH
Investors also assessed economic data on Thursday that showed a steeper-than-expected decline in retail sales in November and the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits falling last week, indicating a tight labor market. The labor market will need to weaken in order to help inflation ease.
All the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were in the red, with communication services .SPLRCL and technology stocks .SPLRCT falling nearly 4% as the worst performing on the session.
Netflix Inc NFLX.O slumped 8.63% after a media report that the company would let its advertisers take their money back after missing viewership targets.
Nvidia Corp NVDA.O dropped 4.09% after HSBC Global Research began coverage of the chipmaker's stock with a ""reduce"" rating.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.15 billion shares, compared with the 10.63 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.81-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted two new 52-week highs and seven new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 66 new highs and 334 new lows.

2022-12-19 00:00:00+00:00,2 Top-Ranked Stocks to Buy From the Edge Computing Space in 2023,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-top-ranked-stocks-to-buy-from-the-edge-computing-space-in-2023,"Edge computing is a distributed computing architecture that relocates processing and data storage near data sources. The speed of 5G, combined with edge computing, further reduces the latency to support use cases, wherein near-real-time processing is critical.

The edge computing industry is being shaped by several trends. With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the increasing need for greater data processing and analytics, the demand for edge computing is growing.

According to a report by Grand View Research, the global edge computing industry is expected to attain a value of $11.24 billion by the end of 2022, and grow, witnessing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.9% from 2022 through 2030, reaching a value of $155.90 billion at the end of the forecast period.

This is driving companies such as Arista Networks ANET and Cloudflare NET to adopt edge solutions to better manage their data, reduce latency and improve overall user experience. With the rising demand for edge computing solutions, investors are pouring money into the space.

Edge computing use cases are expanding, as businesses look for new ways to leverage the technology. Because 5G creates a bigger, faster medium to carry data, it can deliver the ultra-low latency required for many applications, including the widespread deployment of autonomous vehicles, advanced healthcare services such as remote telesurgery and the metaverse.
Edge Computing Players Leading the Way to Growth
Some of the top companies leading the global edge computing industry are Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and NVIDIA NVDA. These are well-positioned to benefit from the secular tailwinds in the enterprise software and edge computing space.

Microsoft has a large and diverse portfolio of products and services, from cloud computing and machine learning to artificial intelligence and IoT. This gives the company a unique advantage in the edge computing market, as it can offer customers a comprehensive solution that covers all their needs.

2022-12-21 00:00:00+00:00,Why Intel Stock Shot Higher on Wednesday,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-stock-shot-higher-on-wednesday,"What happened
A onetime investor darling that has somewhat fallen out of favor, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) had a good session on the stock market Wednesday. On news of an adjustment in its corporate structure, investors traded the chipmaker's share price up by nearly 1.5%.
So what
That morning, Intel announced that it would be restructuring its graphics hardware operations in order to become more competitive. The accelerated computing systems and graphics group, abbreviated as AXG, will be split in two. One successor division will concentrate on high-performance computing (HPC), and another will focus on the gaming market.
AXG's leader Raja Koduri will return to his previous job as Intel's chief architect. Employees under his management will be shifted to either the company's PC or server chip units.
Intel has been a dominant force for years in the tech industry's central processing unit (CPU) segment and is a veteran manufacturer of graphics hardware. However, it has been eclipsed by prominent rivals in the latter segment, notably graphics card specialist Nvidia. Meanwhile, it has also come under pressure from up-and-coming CPU makers, notably Apple.
Now what
In a statement on the move quoted in various media reports, Intel said that ""Discrete graphics and accelerated computing are critical growth engines"" for its business.
""With our flagship products now in production, we are evolving our structure to accelerate and scale their impact and drive go-to-market strategies with a unified voice to customers,"" the company added.
While this won't make Intel a graphics powerhouse at a single stroke, it's a tacit acknowledgment that it needs to find a way to be more competitive in the segment. It's no wonder that investors were cautiously optimistic about the move.

2022-12-22 00:00:00+00:00,2 Magnificent Semiconductor Stocks Down 46% and 51% to Buy Before the Next Bull Market,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-magnificent-semiconductor-stocks-down-46-and-51-to-buy-before-the-next-bull-market,"Legendary investor Peter Lynch once said, ""When there's a war going on, don't buy the companies that are doing the fighting; buy the companies that sell the bullets."" That advice can be applied to chipmakers. While numerous companies are fighting for control of end markets like cloud computing, consumer electronics, and electric cars, all of them depend heavily on semiconductors.
Building on that, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) have seen their share prices plunge 51% and 46%, respectively, but both stocks are well positioned to rebound when economic conditions improve and the next bull market thunders to life.
Here's what investors should know.
Nvidia: The leader in graphics and accelerated data center computing
Nvidia delivered a dismal third-quarter report. Revenue from its gaming and professional-visualization products plunged 51% and 65%, respectively, and data center sales growth decelerated sharply to 31%. Nvidia also booked a $702 million inventory charge related to weak data center demand in China. That write-down cut deeply into the bottom line. Putting all the pieces together shows total revenue falling 17% to $5.9 billion and earnings cratering 72% to $0.27 per diluted share.
Fortunately, there is a silver lining: The economic challenges will pass in time, and the bull case for Nvidia remains crystal clear. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in rendering realistic visual effects and accelerating data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, Nvidia holds over 90% market share in workstation graphics and supercomputer accelerators, and the company has consistently set performance records at the MLPerf benchmarks, a biannual competition that measures the capabilities of AI hardware and software.
Better yet, Nvidia has continuously reinforced its superiority in graphics and data center computing through product innovation. For instance, Omniverse is a suite of subscription software that lets creators collaborate on 3D design projects and metaverse application development; it also serves as a simulation engine that helps engineers build AI models for self-driving cars and autonomous robots.
Similarly, Nvidia has broadened its data center product portfolio with high-performance networking solutions, server central processing units (CPUs), and subscription software for AI application development.
In a nutshell, Nvidia provides mission-critical computing technology with use cases across many large and growing industries, from manufacturing and logistics to retail and healthcare, and the company is well positioned to benefit as AI becomes more deeply engrained in daily life.
On that note, management values its addressable market at $1 trillion, leaving a long runway for growth. And with shares trading at 14.2 times sales -- a discount compared to the three-year average of 20.3 times sales -- now is a good time to buy this stock.
Taiwan Semiconductor: The leading chip manufacturer
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) runs the largest foundry in the world, meaning it shoulders the cost-intensive burden of producing chips designed by other companies. In fact, TSMC has won the business of many popular technology companies, including consumer electronics giant Apple, high-performance computing specialist AMD, and Nvidia.
TSMC benefits from immense scale. It captured 56% market share in Q2, four times more than the next closest foundry, according to Counterpoint Research. That allows TSMC to invest more aggressively in product development, creating a flywheel that has consistently kept the company on the cutting edge of chipmaking technology. In fact, TSMC hopes to achieve volume production with its latest 3-nanometer process before the end of 2022, and management says it will be the ""most advanced semiconductor technology"" on the market.
Turning to financial performance, Q3 revenue climbed 36% to $20.2 billion, and earnings soared 66% to $1.79 per American depositary receipt. Those results are particularly impressive given the difficult economic conditions, and they reflect strong demand for Apple's new iPhone. However, management does expect inflation-fueled weakness in demand to weigh on its financial results through the first half of 2023, but those headwinds will ultimately be temporary.
On that note, the investment thesis for TSMC is straightforward: It is a critical link in the semiconductor supply chain, and its business should grow alongside industries like smartphones, high-performance computing, and the Internet of Things. Shares currently trade at 5.5 times sales, a discount to the three-year average of 9.7 times sales, which creates a reasonable buying opportunity for investors.

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $6.02 billion, down 21.26% from the year-ago period.
Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.27 per share and revenue of $26.94 billion. These totals would mark changes of -26.35% and +0.1%, respectively, from last year.
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.
The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

2022-12-27 00:00:00+00:00,5 Ultra-Popular Stocks I'd Sell Right Now,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-ultra-popular-stocks-id-sell-right-now,"In just a few days, one of the most challenging years on record for investors will come to a close. The bond market may end up logging its worst year ever, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all entered bear markets at one point or another in 2022.
Although bear markets have historically represented the ideal time for opportunistic investors to do some shopping, it's important to recognize that not every perceived discount will prove to be a bargain. As we get ready to move into a new year, five ultra-popular companies with glaring red flags stand out as stocks I'd sell right now.

Tesla
The first stock I believe investors would be wise to pare down or outright sell right now is electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Tesla made last year's list of stocks I'd sell right now, and it's declined 65% on a year-to-date basis. But I don't believe it's anywhere close to a bottom.
To begin with, Tesla isn't immune to the issues that are plaguing the auto industry. Persistent supply chain issues, possible provincial lockdowns in China tied to COVID-19, and historically high inflation are headwinds all automakers are contending with. Tesla is facing these same demand and production struggles, and we're beginning to see evidence of this weakness as discounting of its EVs ramps up.
To add to the above, Tesla's energy and solar business continues to lose money. Though optimists like to point to Tesla as being ""more than a car company,"" the fact of the matter is that its profits are entirely dependent on its auto operations. In 2023, the company's auto segment should face serious margin compression.
But the biggest issue with Tesla is its CEO, Elon Musk. Even though Musk is a visionary that built Tesla from the ground up to mass production, he's become a clear operating, legal, and financial liability for the company. The vast majority of Musk's innovation timelines aren't being met, and his side-project acquisition of Twitter appears to be distracting him from running the largest auto company in the world by market cap.
Bed Bath & Beyond
Another widely owned stock I'd give the heave-ho to for 2023 is home furnishing retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ: BBBY). Though it's been a popular short squeeze stock, the company's operating performance and corporate bonds spell big-time trouble ahead.
Like a number of brick-and-mortar-focused retailers, Bed Bath & Beyond has had its lunch eaten by online retailers that have the ability to undercut traditional retailers on price. Bed Bath & Beyond hoped to overcome this by modernizing its supply chain and putting differentiated products in its store. Unfortunately, the company's product assortment hasn't been a draw for consumers who, in large part, continue to choose online competitors that can offer lower prices. As a result, comparable-store sales plummeted 26% in the quarter ended Aug. 27, 2022.
The company's balance sheet also serves as a warning. When the fiscal second quarter came to a close in late August, Bed Bath & Beyond had $135.3 million in cash and cash equivalents left, which compared to $1.73 billion in long-term debt. What's more, it wasn't clear at the time if the company would have enough capital to cover its liabilities over the next 12 months.
The bond market has been pretty skeptical, too. Although the company introduced an offer to exchange its 2024, 2034, and 2044 senior debt lots for new convertible notes, the 2024 and 2044 notes were respectively trading at 85% and 90% below par ($0.15 and $0.10 on the dollar) prior to this exchange. Such levels indicate a high probability of future insolvency.

Netflix
The third extremely popular stock I'd suggest selling is streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Even though Netflix is profitable on a recurring basis at a time when other streaming platforms seem to be hemorrhaging money, there are plenty of red flags heading into the new year.
There was once a time when Netflix appeared to be miles ahead of its streaming competition. While it still has an impressive library of original content, Netflix's domestic and international streaming market share has been shrinking. As competition picks up and Netflix cracks down on password sharing, consumers will have far more choices for content.
Perhaps the more concerning issue for Netflix is the company's cash flow. For years, Netflix has spent a small fortune expanding its reach into international markets. Until a few years ago, this was a company that burned more money than it generated from its operations every year. But even though it's now cash-flow positive, Netflix still isn't generating a lot of cash.
With U.S. and global economic growth slowing, as well as COVID-19 vaccines getting people back to their pre-pandemic daily lives, subscriber growth prospects for Netflix look mediocre, at best. For a company valued at a seemingly astronomical 42 times Wall Street's forecast cash flow for 2023, this looks like a recipe for disappointment.
Moderna
A fourth popular stock I'd sell right now is biotech stock Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA). This big pandemic winner looks set to completely lose its luster in the new year.
On the bright side, Moderna's mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax, helped to completely change the game in the U.S. and abroad. This year, Moderna will recognize between $18 billion and $19 billion in advanced purchase agreements and is expected to generate more than $21 per share in profit, based on Wall Street's consensus. This comes after a $28.29 per-share profit in 2021.
The bad news is that COVID-19 vaccines move from government purchases to the private market in 2023. While that could lead to better pricing power for Moderna's Spikevax, it almost certainly means increased competition and a big drop-off in revenue as the worst of the pandemic looks to have passed. With three vaccine developers hitting at least a 90% vaccine efficacy -- Moderna is one of those three -- competition will be fierce for booster shots moving forward.
The bigger problem for Moderna is that its cancer vaccine pipeline, while promising, is years away from contributing meaningfully in the sales column. This means Moderna is entering the new year with a market value of $76 billion, a forward price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 45, and a multiple of more than 8 times Wall Street's forecast sales. That's extremely pricey for a biotech stock with regulatory approvals in only one area of focus (COVID-19 infection).
Nvidia
The fifth ultra-popular stock I'd sell right now is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). While Nvidia isn't a poorly run company, it's no longer the growth story that made it one of the most valuable companies in the world in 2021.
If there's a positive for Nvidia, it's that the company controls 80% of the discrete graphics card market. These are graphics processing units (GPUs) that operate separately from the processing chip. This dominance of discrete graphics cards can bolster the company's moneymaking gaming segment.
On the other hand, gaming revenue has absolutely fallen off a cliff in recent quarters (down 51% year over year in the fiscal third quarter). The blame may lie with COVID-19 vaccines allowing people to get back to their daily lives. Less time at home means less gaming.
However, Nvidia is also contending with an export ban on its A100 GPUs to China. These are some of the company's fastest GPUs that rely on artificial intelligence. Nvidia is circumventing this export ban by offering a slower GPU for export to China, but it's unclear if sales of this newer GPU will be anywhere close to what was expected of the A100.
During bear markets, valuations come into focus. Whereas most semiconductor stocks are trading at historically attractive multiples relative to their forward-year earnings or book value, Nvidia is still commanding a forward-year price-to-earnings multiple of 35. My suspicion is we'll see these profit forecasts fall considerably in 2023.

2022-12-28 00:00:00+00:00,NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-corporation-nvda-is-attracting-investor-attention%3A-here-is-what-you-should-know-2,"Nvidia (NVDA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Over the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -9.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has lost 11.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share, indicating a change of -38.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $3.27 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -26.4%. This estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.37 indicates a change of +33.8% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
In the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $6.02 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.3%. The $26.94 billion and $29.42 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.1% and +9.2%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Nvidia reported revenues of $5.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -16.5%. EPS of $0.58 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.93 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.02%. The EPS surprise was -17.14%.
Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

2022-12-29 00:00:00+00:00,3 Seriously Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-seriously-undervalued-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-now,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
After a nice rally off the October lows, we’re seeing selling pressure on tech stocks pick up. Specifically, chip and semiconductor stocks are taking a big hit again. As a result, many investors are looking for potentially undervalued semiconductor stocks.
Semi stocks are interesting. On the one hand, many of them sell commoditized products and are cyclical. In other words, they have poor margins while their fate is largely determined by the direction of the economy.
On the other hand, other chip makers have excellent margins, particularly in strong semiconductor markets. And some companies in the sector may have fairly non-cyclical businesses, given how critical its components are to today’s technologies.
With that in mind, let’s try to find non-cyclical chip companies with high margins whose stocks have tumbled along with those of the less attractive names.

TSM Taiwan Semiconductor $73.06
AMD Advanced Micro Devices $62.57
AVGO Broadcom $544.89
Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)

Just because a company is more non-cyclical doesn’t mean it’s immune to the swoons of the economy.  Just look at Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), which has suffered a peak-to-trough decline of 59%. After rallying strongly, the shares are again struggling to regain their momentum.
Taiwan Semi will end up generating strong growth in its fiscal 2022, but its earnings are expected to decline in 2023. Analysts, on average, expect its bottom line to fall 7.5% next year, and the mean estimate calls for a modest 3% increase in its revenue.
While its growth is expected to decelerate next year, its top and bottom lines are still expected to be much higher than in 2021. Analysts’ average estimates call for earnings of $5.96 a share in 2023 on revenue of roughly $77 billion. That’s still up 44% and 35.5% versus  its 2021 performance, respectively.
That’s not the traditional way to value a stock. But it provides perspective on a stock that trades at 11.5 times this year’s earnings and 12.3 times the average EPS estimate for 2023.
Plus, Taiwan Semi has very good operating margins for the sector, as its operating margins are usually around 47%. For what it’s worth, that’s better than the numbers reported by the FAANG stocks and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) did not rise as much above its October low as I thought it would, given the extent of the rallies of its peers.
Regardless, the stock is starting to look like a potential bargain as it hovers in the low $60s. If the shares of AMD retest their recent low near $54.50, they will be hard for long-term investors to ignore  At that point, the shares would be trading for less than 16 times the company’s earnings.
CEO Lisa Su has worked hard to drastically improve the company’s balance sheet, profitability and free cash flow. Analysts’ long-term estimates for AMD have indeed declined over the last several quarters. That was to be expected given the economic climate. But did you know that most analysts still expect the company to generate positive earnings and revenue growth in 2023?
They expect the company to generate mild growth, but they’re calling for growth nonetheless. And if the shares do retest their low, the stock will have fallen at least 67% from its high. At some point, enough is enough.
Broadcom (AVGO)
Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com
One name that seems to fly under the radar is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). Despite sporting a $228 billion market cap, AVGO seems to get  little attention, compared with some of the more popular names in this space.
Of those on this list, Broadcom has certainly held up the best, as its peak-to-trough decline was “just” 38%. Further,  Broadcom has a 3.3% dividend yield. That helps give investors a little bit of a cushion while they wait out this bear market.
The stock is still up 33% from its recent low as investors realized how well the company has been doing despite the macroeconomic challenges. AVGO stock rebounded after Broadcom delivered a top- and bottom-line beat, provided better-than-expected Q1 guidance and raised its dividend by 12%.
Analysts, on average, expect the company to deliver mid- to high-single-digit-percentage revenue and earnings growth in its fiscal  2023 (which is just beginning) and in FY24. For that growth, investors are paying just 13.5 times analysts’ mean earnings estimate for this year.
The shares previously bottomed around $415. If the bear market roars again, I’m sure Broadcom will be under pressure.
Will it retest its low? I don’t know, but if it does so — and analysts’ earnings estimates don’t change — the stock would be trading at roughly ten times AVGO’s earnings with a dividend yield of 4.5%.
Now that would be hard to ignore.

2022-12-30 00:00:00+00:00,This Large-Cap Semiconductor Stock Has Been Hot,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-large-cap-semiconductor-stock-has-been-hot,"After a scorching-hot run, semiconductor stocks cooled off in 2022, impacting many portfolios. SOXX, the iShares Semiconductor ETF, is down more than 30% year-to-date, widely underperforming compared to the S&P 500.
In addition, other popular chip stocks, including NVIDIA NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD, have performed poorly in 2022, as shown in the chart below.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
However, Broadcom AVGO has entirely snapped the overall bearish trend, with shares climbing more than 25% after bottoming in October. As we can see, the performance has crushed the S&P 500.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Broadcom is a premier designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices. The company’s products are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, and broadband access, to name a few.
Let’s take a closer look at how the company currently stacks up.
Quarterly Performance
Broadcom’s earnings track record is mighty impressive; AVGO has exceeded top and bottom line estimates in eleven consecutive quarters.
The company penciled in a 1.8% EPS beat paired with revenue 0.4% above expectations in its latest release, providing shares the fuel they needed. AVGO has a favorable revenue trend, as seen in the chart below.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Dividends & Cash Flow
For those that seek income, AVGO has that covered. The company’s annual dividend currently yields a rock-solid 3.3%, notably higher than the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average.
Undoubtedly a positive, the company has shown a commitment to increasingly rewarding its shareholders, upping its dividend payout five times over the last five years and carrying a sizable 26% five-year annualized growth rate.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
In addition, the company’s free cash flow strength is hard to ignore; in its latest quarter, Broadcom generated roughly $4.5 billion in free cash flow, good enough for a 4% sequential uptick and an even larger 30% Y/Y uptick.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Growth Outlook
For the cherry on top, Broadcom carries a favorable growth profile, with earnings and revenue forecasted to climb 7.4% and 5% in FY23, respectively.
And in FY24, estimates call for an additional 7% growth in earnings and a 4.9% Y/Y uptick in revenue.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Bottom Line
Semiconductors have sailed through challenging waters in 2022, ending stellar runs.
However, Broadcom AVGO has been an exception to the poor performance, widely outperforming other semiconductor stocks and embarking on a strong run since bottoming in October.
The company has consistently exceeded quarterly estimates, rewards investors handsomely, generates solid cash, and has an inspiring growth trajectory for the foreseeable future.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2023-01-04 00:00:00+00:00,Could the Dow Jones Keep Outperforming the Nasdaq Composite in 2023?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/could-the-dow-jones-keep-outperforming-the-nasdaq-composite-in-2023,"It finally happened. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) outperformed the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) in 2022. It marked just the third time the Dow has outperformed the Nasdaq since 2008, and the first time since the year 2000 that the Dow beat the Nasdaq by at least a 20 percentage point margin.
The question now is whether the Dow will come out on top once again in 2023. And if so, what impact would that have on the stock market and your investment portfolio?
Data by YCharts.
Composition of the Dow versus the Nasdaq
The Dow is the oldest stock market index, but it has a major flaw -- it's price-weighted. That means the index weights are determined by stock price, not market cap.
By contrast, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are market-cap weighted. That means the largest companies -- like Apple and Microsoft -- make up the biggest names in those indexes.
State Street Global Advisors operates the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: DIA), the largest Dow exchange-traded fund (ETF). The ETF matches the weights of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. As of Dec. 30, 2022, the top 10 holdings were as follows:
COMPANY
WEIGHT
UnitedHealth Group
10.5%
Goldman Sachs Group
6.9%
Home Depot
6.3%
McDonald's
5.2%
Amgen
5.2%
Microsoft
4.8%
Caterpillar
4.8%
Honeywell International
4.3%
Visa Inc. Class A
4.1%
Boeing Company
3.8%
Total weight of top 10 holdings
55.9%
Data source: State Street Global Advisors.
The top 10 largest Dow stocks make up 55.9% of the index, and a big run-up in a stock's price (or a decline) can drastically change the dynamic of the Dow.
UnitedHealth stock is up about 135% in the last five years, a big move for a stodgy blue-chip dividend stock. The move has pole-vaulted UnitedHealth to the No. 1 holding, comprising over 10% of index weight.
Apple stock has done even better than UnitedHealth, up over 190% in the last five years. But because Apple completed a 4-for-1 stock split in Aug. 2020, it doesn't even crack the top 10 Dow holdings. If it hadn't completed the split, the stock price would be around $500 per share, just under UnitedHealth for the second-largest holding in the Dow.
The wonky structure of the Dow makes minor events like stock splits or the arbitrary nature of a stock's price meaningful.
Meanwhile, the top 10 components of the Nasdaq Composite make up 47.3% of the index with Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet making up 36.4% of the index.

However, the other half or so of the index consists of over 3,600 companies, so there's a lot more diversity within the Nasdaq than the Dow.
It also may surprise investors that the Nasdaq is chock full of non-tech companies. For example, Amazon and Tesla are actually considered consumer-discretionary stocks, while Alphabet and Meta Platforms fall under the communications sector. Pepsi and Costco are both consumer staples. In some ways, the Nasdaq does a much better job representing the broader economy than the Dow.

Valuation comparison
Risk-averse investors would do well to consider some top Dow stocks because of their reliability and track records for persevering through economic cycles. On the other hand, risk-tolerant investors may be better off sticking with higher-risk, potentially higher-reward growth stocks.
For everyone in between, it may be helpful to ask yourself: Do you think UnitedHealth, Goldman Sachs, Home Depot, and Amgen are going to outperform Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon over the next five-plus years? Or are investors just driving up the prices of safe stocks like UnitedHealth in the short term?
Valuation is also a concern. The largest component of the Dow, UnitedHealth, now trades at a price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.4, compared to its 10-year median of 20.4. Meanwhile, the largest component of the Nasdaq Composite -- Apple -- trades at a 20.5 P/E ratio, compared to its 10-year median of 17.1.
There are a few Dow stocks that are worth avoiding or even selling at this point. It's hard to justify UnitedHealth, Coca-Cola, and McDonald's having higher P/E ratios than Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but they do. And that's a cause for concern if the Dow is going to beat the Nasdaq for much longer.
Why the Nasdaq will continue beating the Dow over the long term
The Dow could very well beat the Nasdaq again in 2023 if investors continue fleeing to safe, dividend-paying companies with moderate valuations instead of growth stocks (27 of the 30 Dow components pay dividends). But over time, it's hard to see the Dow coming out on top.
A lot of the wealth created over the last few decades has come from Nasdaq components. And many future growth trends are likely to benefit Nasdaq components too.
You could even argue the purpose of the Dow isn't even to beat the Nasdaq or S&P 500. Rather, the Dow is meant to act as a barometer of the old and new economy. And to its credit, it does a good job providing a safe haven for capital preservation and passive income. In contrast, the Nasdaq Composite is more focused on capital appreciation, and many components don't pay sizable dividends.
Ultimately, investors have to consider the weaker growth prospects for companies in the Dow relative to those in the Nasdaq, plus the inflated valuations of many major Dow components right now. Anyone who can tolerate a little more risk and who's looking to add to their investment portfolio is better off focusing on Nasdaq stocks with a few Dow names sprinkled in too.

2023-01-05 00:00:00+00:00,Got game? Automakers show off in-car entertainment options at CES,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/got-game-automakers-show-off-in-car-entertainment-options-at-ces,"By Joseph White and Dawn Chmielewski
LAS VEGAS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - What started out as a novelty offered by Elon Musk to Tesla TSLA.O owners has turned into table stakes in the next generation of electric vehicles.
Automakers from Sony Honda to Hyundai are introducing ways at the CES 2023 technology trade show this week to reshape the in-car entertainment experience, including offering video games during the rides. They are positioning themselves to take advantage of the time people spend in their cars as a source of potentially lucrative, recurring revenue.
""This is a field which can be deployed very quickly,"" Dirk Hilgenberg, head of Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE CARIAD software unit, told Reuters at CES. ""You could just host the third-party app for a streaming service, or generate joint platforms. You guarantee certain volumes, you guarantee certain revenue.""
While car radios have been an entertainment staple in vehicles for decades, Tesla vehicles have reset consumer expectations with the ability to watch popular video streaming services, such as Netflix NFLX.O, YouTube and Hulu, while the vehicle is parked and charging.
In December, Tesla issued a ""holiday update"" to its software to add access to 1,000 PC games through the Steam platform.
Other automakers have followed suit. In October, BMW BMWG.DE announced a partnership with AirConsole to bring casual gaming into its vehicles. Stellantis STLA.MI last year announced plans to add Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Fire TV for Auto to its new Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs.
In Las Vegas, South Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS said it would use technology developed by Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, a company whose chips power PC gaming, to stream games in cars.
Nvidia's cloud-based game service, known as GeForce Now, would provide access to more than 1,000 titles from PC game stores such as Steam, as well as free-to-play games such as Fortnite. China's BYD 002594.SZ, 1211.HK and Swedish electric vehicle brand Polestar PSNY.O also are working with Nvidia.
Japan's Sony 6758.T, the maker of the market-leading PlayStation video game console, on Wednesday at CES said its would be powered by the same Unreal Engine 3D technology used in video games.
Sony promised ""best in class"" movies, games and music, though it offered few details on the vehicle it is developing jointly with Honda Motor Co. 7267.T
""In order to realize intelligent mobility, continuous software updates and high-performance computing are required,"" Yasuhide Mizuno, chief executive of Sony Honda Mobility, told the trade show.
The auto industry has been grappling with how to introduce these new features safely, and restrict use to passengers while the vehicle is in operation.
Tesla became the focus of regulators in 2021 following reports that one feature allowed drivers to play games on the cars' tablet-like touch screen. Tesla disabled the feature while the car was in motion.
Hilgenberg said Volkswagen is developing vehicles that can drive themselves on the highway or in traffic jams, which could give drivers and passengers more time to view videos or play games. But those vehicles will have safety systems that could shut down gaming or video displays to the driver if conditions made automated driving unsafe, he said.
Still, these are features that consumers are demanding, so VW is at CES seeking partnerships.
""In some regions, we will see people say, 'You don't have that? I'm not buying,"" Hilgenberg said. ""We will see the content ... which is provided by software enabled functionality will be a decisive factor for buying.""

2023-01-06 00:00:00+00:00,5 Top Growth Stocks to Buy Right Now That Could Soar in 2023,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-top-growth-stocks-to-buy-right-now-that-could-soar-in-2023,"Well-chosen growth stocks can create fortunes for their shareholders. The key is to identify huge and rapidly expanding industries -- and the businesses that are competing and winning within them.
The following companies are primed to capture bigger portions of massive growth markets. Investors who buy their shares today are likely to be well rewarded.
The Trade Desk
Advertising dollars follow eyeballs. And with more eyes viewing online content every year, ad spending is migrating from legacy media to digital channels.
The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) provides a platform for marketers to buy and manage their digital ad campaigns across a variety of online media. Its transparent pricing and advanced analytics are helping it rapidly gain share in the massive, $800 billion global advertising market.
The connected-TV segment of the ad market is expanding at a particularly brisk pace. Partnerships with the likes of Walt Disney enable The Trade Desk to offer its customers the opportunity to place their ads on popular streaming services, including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+.
These factors have allowed The Trade Desk to grow quickly since its initial public offering (IPO), with its revenue expanding from $203 million in 2016 to nearly $1.5 billion over the trailing 12 months. And with the digital ad industry projected to surpass $1 trillion by 2027, according to Statista, this adtech star has a long runway for growth still ahead.
Microsoft
In the world of technology, few businesses are as diversified as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The tech titan commands a leading share of several enormous markets, such as commuter operating systems, productivity solutions, cloud computing, and gaming.
These varied revenue streams allow Microsoft to survive and even thrive during nearly all manner of market environments, thereby reducing the risks for investors. They also enable the software colossus to profit from the rising adoption of a wide range of new technologies. In 2023 and the years that follow, much of this growth will take place in the cloud.
Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform is growing rapidly within a market that's projected to exceed $1.5 trillion in annual revenue by 2030, up from $484 billion in 2022, according to Grand View Research. The company's booming cloud profits should drive strong returns for shareholders in the coming years.
Snowflake
As more companies shift their operations to the cloud, data -- and the ability to harvest actionable insights from it -- is becoming only more valuable. Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) helps organizations aggregate and analyze information from a wide range of otherwise siloed sources. The data warehousing platform, in turn, is quickly becoming an indispensable technology partner for businesses of all sizes.
Strong customer gains, combined with higher sales to existing clients, are fueling Snowflake's growth. The cloud data specialist's revenue soared 67% year over year to $557 million in the quarter ended Oct. 31.
Management sees much more growth ahead. The company projects that its total market opportunity will expand to a staggering $248 billion by 2026, leaving plenty of room for further gains.
Nvidia
Cloud computing is just one of the powerful trends fueling sales of high-performance semiconductors. Robotics, autonomous vehicles, augmented and virtual reality, and an array of other emerging markets are also boosting demand for high-tech chips. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) makes some of the best chips on the market -- and it's poised to benefit from these trends more than perhaps any other company.
All told, the semiconductor leader estimates its long-term addressable market at $1 trillion. Despite its already impressive $28 billion in annual revenue, an opportunity that large leaves space for tremendous growth, even for a giant like Nvidia.
In the near term, the rumored launch of a new Switch console by Nintendo could provide a significant boost to Nvidia's gaming business in 2023.
PayPal
By eliminating the need to enter your credit card information every time you make a purchase, PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) makes it easier, faster, and more secure to shop online. These benefits have made PayPal a favorite payment option for shoppers. Merchants also love it because PayPal tends to boost their sales conversion rates and, by extension, profits.
After rising sharply during the early stages of the pandemic, e-commerce sales have slowed as more people have returned to brick-and-mortar stores. But online retail sales will grow to nearly $7.4 trillion by 2025, up from $5.5 trillion in 2022, according to eMarketer. As a leading digital-payments platform, PayPal is well-positioned to profit from this global megatrend.
Moreover, a partnership with Apple will bring the iPhone's popular tap-to-pay functionality to PayPal's U.S.-based users in 2023. This growth catalyst, combined with PayPal's cost-cutting initiatives, could help to drive the payment-leader's profits sharply higher in the year ahead.

Semiconductor stocks started off the week on a strong note Monday, with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) gaining 2.3%, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) up 6.3%, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) advancing most of all, up 6.9%, as of 10:25 a.m. ET.
But buying into this rally is not without risk.
So what
Certain semiconductor stocks do look attractive at their present prices. Intel stock, for example, costs less than 9 times trailing earnings currently. AMD and Nvidia, at 39 times and 60 times trailing earnings, respectively, may not be objectively cheap, but they are at least about 50% cheap-er than what they were selling for a year ago.
Investors in developed-world semiconductor giants may also still be encouraged by last week's news that China, which had been expected to throw as much as $143 billion in subsidies at its semiconductor sector, may not actually be able to afford that investment and is rethinking it. The absence of Chinese government support for competing wares can be interpreted as good news for Western semiconductor companies that may benefit from competing subsidies from the U.S. government, announced last year.
And yet, the news is not all good for semiconductor investors.
On Friday, South Korean tech giant Samsung warned that it's expecting to report a 69% decline in profits for its December quarter. Samsung attributed the decline primarily to weak semiconductor demand, which makes up 30% of the company's business. DRAM and NAND flash memory prices are declining alongside the slack demand. At the same time, ""chip inventories are piling up across the supply chain,"" warns Nikkei Asia.
Now what
And that's not even the worse news.
In the face of weak demand and weaker prices, many semiconductor companies have announced plans to rein in their capital investments and at least stop adding more fuel (i.e., more supply) to the fire. Samsung, however, is continuing to invest, continuing to buy new semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and continuing to churn out chips. So even if China ultimately decides not to exacerbate a situation of global semiconductor oversupply, right next door in South Korea, they've decided to do the opposite.
Best-case scenario, I think this could extend the duration of the growing semiconductor glut, depressing prices and profit margins for companies like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia throughout 2023. Worst-case, it could make things worse by driving prices down even further.
If you ask me, that's not a great reason for investors to be going all in on semiconductor stocks today.

2023-01-10 00:00:00+00:00,The Top 5 Stocks Bought by Congress in 2022,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-top-5-stocks-bought-by-congress-in-2022,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Although controversial and viewed by some as a conflict of interest, members of Congress continue to actively trade stocks. And the latest data on those trades reveals that many elected representatives managed to outperform the market in 2022. While 2022 saw all the major indices in the U.S. suffer their worst downturn since the 2008 financial crisis, many members of Congress earned strong gains last year.
Data released by the website Unusual Whales shows that Representative Patrick Fallon (R-Texas), for example, earned 51.6% on his investments in 2022, while Representative Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-Florida) saw a gain of 50.8%. Other members of Congress posted gains of 10% or greater as the benchmark S&P 500 index declined 19% on the year, and the technology-laden Nasdaq fell 33%.
Some members of Congress are extremely active when it comes to buying and selling stocks. Representative Michael McCaul (R-Texas) made more than 1,600 transactions worth as much as $176 million in 2022.
So what’s the secret? Which stocks do members of Congress hold in their personal portfolios? Here is a list of the top five stocks purchased by Congress in 2022.
Ticker Company Price
NVDA Nvidia $156.28
GOOG, GOOGL Alphabet $88.80, $88.02
TSLA Tesla $119.77
DIS Disney $94.77
AAPL Apple $130.15
Top Stocks Held by Congress in 2022: Nvidia (NVDA)

Members of Congress seemed committed to the principle of buying low as they purchased $5.6 million worth of shares in semiconductor and microchip company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the stock declined 46% over the past year. Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia, whose chips are used in everything from electric vehicles to supercomputers, was a darling of the Covid-19 pandemic.
However, NVDA stock led the semiconductor sector lower in 2022 as concerns mounted about slowing demand for semiconductors and microchips, particularly in personal computers, and as supply chain issues hurt production. But elected representatives continue to have faith in Nvidia despite the downturn, judging by the fact that it was the fifth most purchased stock among members of Congress in 2022.
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)

Another tech name that members of Congress gravitated to in 2022 was Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL), the parent company of the search engine Google. The Unusual Whales report shows that federal lawmakers bought $5.7 million worth of Alphabet stock last year as it fell to its most affordable level since its 2004 initial public offering (IPO).
A weakening market for online advertising led to mixed financial results from Alphabet and shook confidence in the company and its stock. As a result, shares of GOOGL have sunk 36% in the past 12 months, dragging the price down to nearly $85. Additionally, Alphabet split its stock on a 20-for-1 basis last summer, which helped to dramatically lower the price. At the start of 2022, GOOGL stock had been trading at more than $2,000 per share.
Congress appears to have taken advantage of both the stock split and price decline and bought Alphabet stock with a vengeance in 2022.
Top Stocks Held by Congress in 2022: Tesla (TSLA)
Source: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com
This might be a decision many members of Congress regret. In 2022, elected officials bought $6 million worth of shares in electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). For the first 11 months of last year, that probably seemed like a smart move. However, in December 2022, TSLA stock fell more than 30%. The stock is now down nearly 70% over the last year and trading at $113 a share.
Sentiment towards TSLA stock appears to be getting worse by the day. Analysts and investors are worried about rising competition in the electric vehicle space and that the competitive advantage Tesla has enjoyed for more than a decade is evaporating. Those concerns seemed to be justified by the fact that Tesla continues to miss its delivery targets and is offering steep discounts on its electric vehicles in markets around the world, notably in China.
Still, Tesla proved to be one of the most popular investments among members of Congress in 2022.
Walt Disney Co. (DIS)

It had arguably its worst year ever in 2022, but that didn’t stop members of Congress from purchasing $6.2 million worth of shares in the Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in 2022. Disney began last year dealing with continued Covid-19 outbreaks that forced its theme parks to operate at reduced capacity and ended 2022 with chief executive officer (CEO) Bob Chapek being ousted and former head honcho Robert Iger returning to lead the Mouse House.
In between, the company had to deal with slowing subscriber growth at its Disney+ streaming service and political controversy in Florida, where its main theme park is based. All the issues contributed to a 40% drop in DIS stock over the last 12 months. However, members of Congress seemed unfazed by the issues impacting the company and were content to buy the dip in Disney stock. The return of Robert Iger at the end of last year has brightened the outlook for Disney, and the stock appears to be responding, gaining 10% during the first trading week of 2023.
Apple (AAPL)

Tied with Disney as the most purchased stock by members of Congress in 2022 is consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Elected representatives bought $6.2 million worth of AAPL stock in 2022, according to Unusual Whales. Apple’s share price is down 25% in the last year, including a nearly 10% drop in December 2022.
While many people, including politicians in Washington, D.C., remain bullish on AAPL stock, the company’s share price has suffered over worries of slowing demand for its iPhone, smartwatch, and Mac computer. Apple has also endured some significant production issues in China as Covid-19 lockdowns disrupted one of its largest manufacturing plants and led to clashes between workers and police.
Much was made of Apple’s market capitalization falling below $2 trillion to start 2023. However, members of Congress seem to retain faith in Apple’s stock, buying the shares heavily on the way down.

2023-01-11 00:00:00+00:00,Invest In a Booming Market: 2 Cloud Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in 2023,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/invest-in-a-booming-market%3A-2-cloud-stocks-to-buy-hand-over-fist-in-2023,"Cloud computing has become one of the fastest-growing and most lucrative industries over the past few years. The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically accelerated the market's growth as more companies looked to move their businesses to the cloud, adopting digital services that made working from anywhere possible. According to Grand View Research, the industry was worth $369 billion in 2021 and will see a compound annual growth rate of 15.7% until 2030.
As a result, dozens of companies have begun carving out their own place in cloud computing, with some already enjoying boosted revenue. In fact, macroeconomic headwinds led many tech companies to suffer losses in 2022. However, cloud computing was largely unaffected, as the industry continued providing impressive revenue growth.
Here are two cloud computing stocks to buy hand over fist in 2023.
Microsoft
As of the third quarter of 2022, Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) cloud computing service Azure held a 21% market share in the industry, second only to Amazon Web Services' 34%. The company made significant strides in the industry in recent years and has plans to grow its market share further.
In November 2022, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed plans to expand Azure by building more data centers in at least 11 new regions, with the company ""very bullish"" about Asia as a growth market. Then just a few days ago, on Jan. 9, news broke that Microsoft had acquired data processing unit manufacturer Fungible for about $190 million, which will further bolster Azure.
Microsoft's motivation to aggressively develop its cloud computing platform is no doubt in part because of the returns it has already seen from its intelligent cloud segment. In the company's first quarter of fiscal 2023, ending Sept. 30, revenue grew 11% year over year to $50.1 billion, with operating income rising 6% to $21.5 billion despite its PC-focused segment reporting operating losses of 15%. The growth was primarily driven by Azure, with Microsoft's cloud computing segment enjoying a revenue rise of 20% year over year to $20.3 billion, and an operating income increase of 17% to $8.9 billion.
As one of the biggest players in cloud computing and with concrete plans to grow its market share, Microsoft is a smart way to invest in the lucrative industry in 2023.
Nvidia
As a leader in graphic processing units (GPUs) with a 72% market share in the discrete part of the market, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) presents a unique opportunity to invest in the hardware side of cloud computing. The company's GPUs are utilized in data centers worldwide, powering the cloud. As the cloud computing market continues to expand, data centers and GPUs are a crucial part of that growth, with Nvidia positioned to profit for the long term.
In November, Nvidia announced a promising partnership with Microsoft's Azure to build a massive cloud artificial intelligence (AI) computer where its GPUs will be combined with the cloud platform. The multi-year collaboration will provide a ""rapid, cost-effective"" avenue for AI development and deployment, according to Nvidia.
An alliance with one of the biggest names in cloud computing is exceptionally encouraging for Nvidia's future in the industry, as Microsoft's plan to build more data centers could lead to further collaboration.
Moreover, Nvidia's data center business has quickly become the most compelling part of its operations, earning the largest amount of revenue in its latest quarter. The company is seeing significant gains from the burgeoning cloud computing market, with revenue in its data center segment rising 30.5% year over year to $3.8 billion in Q3 fiscal 2023. The strong growth suggests Nvidia hasn't even come close to reaching its potential in data centers.
Nvidia suffered a challenging 2022, with its stock plunging 51%. However, its data center business continued to thrive even while its gaming segment faced economic headwinds. The company's participation in cloud computing will likely continue boosting profits for the long term, and when economic troubles subside, bringing a return of consumer demand in its gaming segment, Nvidia will be unstoppable.
Buying Nvidia stock in 2023 could be an investment in a future cloud computing leader.

2023-01-12 00:00:00+00:00,New Data Center Chips Could Mean Massive Growth for 1 Tiny Semiconductor Company,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/new-data-center-chips-could-mean-massive-growth-for-1-tiny-semiconductor-company,"Aehr Test Systems (NASDAQ: AEHR) has been on a wild ride. Shares of the tiny chip manufacturing equipment company have been all over the board in the last year as the market tries to get a handle on the company's biggest growth driver right now: The electric vehicle (EV) market. Its latest trick has been a more than 50% bounce following the second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings update (the three months ended November 2022). Aehr beat financial expectations, but this recent surge in optimism has less to do with EVs and a lot more to do with data centers.
A massive new market even bigger than electric vehicles?
On the surface, Aehr stock's recent run-up has everything to do with the last quarter's results. Revenue was up 54% year over year to $14.8 million, and net income was $3.73 million (compared to just $717,000 last year). Both figures handily beat market analyst predictions as Aehr reported two new customers ramping up production of silicon carbide (SiC) chips, adding fuel to the SiC fire that Aehr's leading customer ON Semi (NASDAQ: ON), as well as SiC pioneer Wolfspeed (NYSE: WOLF), have helped start. The EV market is quickly displacing legacy autos, and Aehr's equipment that tests SiC chips needed in EVs could enjoy strong demand for the duration of the 2020s.
However, as a cyclical manufacturing business that relies on hard-to-predict timing of customer orders for equipment, Aehr has been playing coy with investors. Despite a stellar first half of the current fiscal year, CEO Gayne Erickson and the top team have simply reiterated their outlook for full-fiscal year 2023 revenue to be $60 million to $70 million -- implying growth of 18% to 28% from 2022.
Erickson and company have always maintained that Aehr has other growth verticals outside of EVs, though, and the company provided more than a passing hint at what that is during the last earnings call: Data centers, specifically silicon photonic chips. Through the first half of the current fiscal year, Aehr has reportedly shipped over $5 million in upgrade equipment to silicon photonics manufacturers, up more than 300% from 2021.
Analysts were intrigued, especially by Erickson's further allusion to this being just as big a market, or bigger, for Aehr than EVs. Erickson had this to say when queried about the matter:
So with the announcements by some major suppliers, the 2 largest microprocessor suppliers in the world, the main graphics processors companies in the world, even some of the large fabs like [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM)] and GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: GFS) have created these consortiums to talk about heterogeneous integration, which is a fancy word for multiple chips in one package that include fiber optic transceiver ports on it. And what they're saying is servers first are going to start having chipsets that are in communication with processors and disk drives and data storage through fiber optic ports directly.
In laypersons' terms, data center chips need to get faster to support cloud computing and artificial intelligence applications. As chip designers and manufacturers -- including top semiconductor names like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), and others -- push the current limits of chip technology, silicon photonics (which transmit data from chip to another) could help push those boundaries a bit further. And Aehr Test Systems equipment could play a very large role in the manufacture of those photonics.
Not much has changed, at least not yet
Silicon photonics already have some use today. For example, photonic chips are used in the 2D and 3D sensing chips used in fingerprint readers and facial recognition capabilities in some high-end smartphones (like Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhones). However, as Erickson pointed out on the call, those photonic devices are only on for seconds during the lifetime of the phone, since a biometric or facial scan takes milliseconds to complete. The testing requirements for such photonic chips are minimal as a result.
But things change with silicon photonics used for data transmission, like in a massive data center, where the device will be in use constantly. Testing of the device will be stringent, which leads Erickson to now believe that the silicon photonics market could eventually be larger than SiC for the auto industry.
The key word here, though, is ""eventually."" For now, EVs are what is powering Aehr's financial results. Photonic connections in data center chips won't start really showing up until ""the second half of this decade"" -- 2025 and beyond. That's still a couple of years away, and it remains to be seen how much new business Aehr could pick up from these manufacturers that might start implementing this new technology.
After this last update, Aehr stock trades for over 61 times trailing 12-month earnings per share. Current year expected growth looks handily priced in, and I'm not inclined to add to my position here. For the record, my fair value estimate on Aehr is about $20 a share, though that is by no means a price target or estimate on where I think the stock will head next. However, exciting things are afoot over at Aehr Test Systems. Keep this small chip company on your radar as it begins to expand into new markets like data centers.

hile the great crypto collapse may have garnered most of the headlines towards the end of last year, history will likely mark the biggest news in disruptive tech for 2022 to be OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT in late November. It amassed over 1 million users in just five days right on the heels of its launch of Dall-E in April. In a market that has seen shares plummet, OpenAI has reignited heady valuations.
In this week’s World Reimagined, we will look at the rapidly evolving world of Artificial Intelligence (AI), some of its players, and what companies are poised to gain from a pivotal year where AI hits center stage.
Back in 2018, venture capitalist and computer scientist Kai-Fu Lee told CBS, “I believe [AI] is going to change the world more than anything in the history of mankind. More than electricity.”
For AI to realize its full potential, it needs to be widely available. The launch of ChatGPT, Dall-E and Stable Diffusion in 2022, along with their related applications, make it likely that this is the year Kai-Fu Lee’s prediction becomes real to those outside of AI-focused sectors. 
The 3 Types of AI
AI can be divided into three categories based on capabilities:
Narrow or weak AI is designed to perform a specific task. This application is becoming increasingly common in our daily lives as machine learning and deep learning techniques improve.
General or strong AI is designed to perform any intellectual task that a human can. So far, this has proved highly elusive, but we are getting closer as an international AI race becomes the new global arms race.
Super AI is currently only a hypothetical concept. It is an AI that can perform any task better than a human, is sentient, has emotions and has been used to terrify moviegoers for decades - think Westworld, Blade Runner or Skynet.
Examples of narrow AI include Google’s (GOOG) AlphaGo, IBM’s (IBM) chess-playing supercomputer Deep Blue, Apple’s (AAPL) FaceID unlock, the virtual filters on Snapchat (SNAP) and every writer’s best friend, Grammarly. When I asked ChatGPT if it is a type of narrow AI, this was its response: “Yes, ChatGPT is considered a narrow AI, as it is designed to perform specific tasks and has a limited scope of understanding and capabilities. It is trained on a large dataset of text and can generate human-like responses to text-based prompts, but it does not have the ability to perform a wide range of tasks or understand and process information like a human would.” 
AI Goes Mainstream 
AI is being used across a wide range of industries, such as retail, agriculture, banking, transportation and even by HR departments. Before its public launch, there was already a legion of third-party services and tools being built on top of OpenAI.
For example, on Dec. 12, 2022, Jay Browder, CEO of DoNotPay, tweeted a screen-capture of his company’s AI talking to Comcast’s (CMCSA) AI-driven chatbot to save one of his company’s engineers $120 a year on their internet bill - an AI-to-AI chat that can save you money! The company plans to take on two speeding ticket cases in court next month, using its AI to tell the defendants what to say. 
Other ChatGPT-based applications include QuickVid, which is designed to generate viral YouTube shorts, and MightyGPT, which puts the “superpowers of GPT-3 and ChatGPT” on Meta’s (Meta) WhatsApp and soon on Apple’s (AAPL) iMessage. In October 2022, another OpenAI-based service, Jasper, reached a $1.5 billion valuation just 18 months after it launched, having amassed 100,000 customers, around 75% of whom pay $80 or more monthly for the company’s suite of AI-powered writing templates, striking fear into the hearts of contract writers everywhere. 
OpenAI and its ChatGPT aren’t the only games in town. Anthropic, which was started by former OpenAI employees, has received over $700 million in funding and developed an AI system similar to ChatGPT that reportedly has more “grace” than ChatGPT. Its AI, dubbed Claude, is currently accessible only through a Slack integration as part of a closed beta. The tech was created using a technique called “constitutional AI” that aims to provide a principle-based approach to aligning AI systems with human intentions, which basically means it will be more polite and less offensive in its responses than other models. When you think that these AIs learn from the internet, offensive responses aren’t much of a stretch. The company has indicated that it is looking for a valuation of at least $5 billion in its upcoming $200 million round. Sam Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison and other ex-FTX colleagues collectively invested over $500 million in Anthropic during prior rounds, so their stakes will likely get sold to the highest bidder soon since their assets have been frozen. 
Adept AI Labs is another startup whose founders include former leaders of OpenAI and Google AI. It reportedly recently sought a valuation of around $1 billion following its $250 million valuation during its latest funding round last year. Both Adept and Anthropic are looking for valuations that are hundreds of times their projected topline revenue – heady days are back in parts of the tech sector! 
The release of Stable Diffusion in 2022 was not remarkable only because it was open source, but even more amazing was its diminutive size; AI code tends to be bulky. Upon its release, it was already possible to run it on some consumer graphics cards. In less than a month, it had been optimized to the point where it could be run on an iPhone, leading Apple to announce in December that it had released “optimizations to Core ML for Stable Diffusion in MacOS12.1 and iOS 16.2, along with code to get started deploying in Apple Silicon devices.” What is likely the most interesting aspect of this is the privacy angle because any data entered by an Apple user using this tool will stay on the device. It also means that after downloading it, users won’t need an internet connection, opening up opportunities in areas where connectivity is challenging. 
Innovation is only going to accelerate. According to Senior Partner & Managing Director at Boston Consulting Group and Global Leader of BCG X Sylvain Duranton, “Despite economic headwinds, 60% of BCG’s recently surveyed companies plan to increase their investments in digital and AI in 2023.” According to IDC Research, spending worldwide by governments and businesses on AI technology will top $500 billion in 2023.
Microsoft Gets Serious
The power of ChatGPT lit up social media, with some hypothesizing that it could mean the end of Google’s search dominance. According to Semafor, Microsoft (MSFT) has reportedly been in talks to invest an additional $10 billion in the owner of ChatGPT in a deal that would value OpenAI at $29 billion. The two have been intimately linked since inception. Three years ago, Microsoft invested $1 billion in a project originally co-founded by Elon Musk and Sam Altman, former Y Combinator president, that became known as OpenAI, in an effort to overtake Amazon (AMZN) and Google in their AI efforts. 
ChatGPT’s stunning success means OpenAI needs more of everything, as anyone who has tried to use it can attest. The Microsoft OpenAI deal is a highly unusual structure, according to those claiming to be familiar with the deal. First, OpenAI will pay back its first investors. Then, Microsoft gets 75% of OpenAI’s profits until its principal investment is paid back and 49% of profits after that until it reaches a theoretical cap.
Who’s Winning?
We are still in the early innings of the AI race, but it is already clear that Amazon’s AWS is poised to be a winner as AI requires massive amounts of computing power. For example, the CEO of Stability reported that his company used 256 Nvidia (NVDA) A100s on AWS for 150,000 hours at the cost of $600,000 to train Stable Diffusion. ChatGPT obviously is using Microsoft for computing capacity. Click here to read about chip manufacturers that are poised to benefit in my article last month on Healthcare and AI. 
The next phase of AI could also benefit the social media OG Meta, given its massive amounts of data, which is vital food for machine learning, and the reality that its entire business is based on AI that seeks to target users with increasingly personalized content. Its business is basically all about AI experimentation and iteration. Don’t count this behemoth out just yet and keep a close eye on what is happening with MightyGPT on WhatsApp. 
Alphabet’s Google claims to have image generation AI that outperforms Dall-E and is rumored to have a conversation chat product that is superior to ChatGPT, but so far, it is all just rumor.
We’ve already discussed Microsoft getting even cozier with OpenAI, but what could be yet another major coup for the tech giant is the rumored incorporation of OpenAI’s AI into its Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, and other apps. The Information recently reported that the company’s Bing search plans to use OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology. For those really interested, I suggest you ask ChatGPT itself about how Microsoft could use it, if you can find a time when it isn’t already at capacity.
The Bottom Line 
The internet shrunk the world, allowing us to transact and communicate, regardless of geography. The smartphone placed the whole of human knowledge in the palm of one’s hand and further expanded our ability to communicate, transact and learn. Buckminster Fuller’s “knowledge doubling curve,” pointed out that until 1900, human knowledge doubled approximately every century. By the end of World War II, knowledge was doubling every 25 years. 
Today, on average, human knowledge is estimated to double every 13 months. AI will not just accelerate growth in knowledge but will also give us the ability to use that knowledge in ways that will likely make every other technological advance pale in comparison. From healthcare to energy, construction to the cosmos, we will be able to solve more problems, solve them faster, and solve them more effectively than we could have been dreamed of just a few decades ago.

2023-01-17 00:00:00+00:00,Better Gaming Stock: AMD vs. Nvidia,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-gaming-stock%3A-amd-vs.-nvidia,"While the gaming industry is best known for console manufacturers Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, PC gaming has grown rapidly since the start of the pandemic. PC gaming is all about having the most powerful components, which can provide a more detailed and smoother experience than consoles.
A critical component of PC gaming is a graphic processing unit (GPU), such as the ones from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). The rise of PC gaming has given both companies' stocks triple-digit growth over the last five years.
Declining demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) throughout 2022 coincided with rising inflation and brought down Nvidia and AMD shares between 37% and 48% year over year. However, these companies are unlikely to be down forever, making now an excellent time to invest in one of these tech stars.
Which is the better buy? Let's find out.
Nvidia could see boost on Nintendo console success
The last year has been challenging for Nvidia's stock. The price has dropped nearly 35% in the last 12 months, and at $169, it's close to half the 2021 peak of $329. Despite the price drop, Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is still high at 72.
If it's going to reclaim its losses, the semiconductor designer must keep growing its revenue in a difficult economic environment. That's where its new line-up of GPUs for PC gaming comes in.
Beginning their staggered release in November, Nvidia's RTX 4000 series of GPUs is the company's biggest hardware launch since 2020. The new models replace the RTX 3000 series of cards, which were wildly successful throughout the pandemic and crypto-mining boom.
However, things have gotten off to a rocky start, with Nvidia ""unlaunching"" one of its models following consumer backlash and sales not living up to expectations. It isn't all Nvidia's fault, though -- the GPU market hit a 20-year sales low in the third quarter of 2022.
With the market slump, Nvidia has launched its RTX 4000 series at potentially the worst moment in the last 20 years. The end of crypto mining for Ethereum killed that entire segment for Nvidia, and due to the rising cost of living, gamers aren't showing much appetite to upgrade to the new models.
As a result, there's already talk of Nvidia dropping prices. In 2022, the company misjudged how much consumers were willing to spend by releasing cards at much higher prices than the last generation. The RTX 3080, Nvidia's high-end mainstream GPU, has been replaced by the RTX 4080, with the former launching in 2020 for $699 and the latest version starting at $1,199.
Nvidia has options for adjusting pricing, but if the market drop from Q3 2022 indicates a trend, it will be fighting against the current.
Fortunately, GPUs aren't Nvidia's only source of income from gaming. It also provides the system on a chip (SoC) for the Nintendo Switch. The Switch will be 6 years old in March and is still selling much better than its age would suggest. At 114 million units sold, including over 20 million last year, it's on track to potentially be the best-selling video game console ever.
Nintendo is hard at work on its successor to the Switch, rumored to be again powered by an SoC from Nvidia. The sequel console is expected to be announced in either 2023 or 2024. If the GPU market doesn't pick up, Nvidia will need the Switch successor to be a hit.
AMD enjoys more diverse exposure to gaming
AMD's stock has followed a similar trend as Nvidia's, with its shares down 46% in the last year. The stock is also considerably down from its 2021 peak of $155, now sitting at $71.
Fortunately for AMD, its P/E ratio of 42 is slightly more attractive than Nvidia's. The company also doesn't have as much invested in the success of the GPU market as Nvidia, despite competing with equivalent models.
In Q3 2022, AMD had a 16% market share in the discrete GPU market. Meanwhile, Nvidia had a 72% market share in the same quarter. As a result, a sustained slump in the market would harm Nvidia considerably more than AMD.
Moreover, AMD has its own position in the console market, providing SoCs to Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S consoles. Combined, the new consoles from Sony and Microsoft are outselling the Nintendo Switch, providing AMD a bigger revenue boost from consoles than Nvidia.
AMD also provides processors (CPUs) for the consumer and gaming enthusiast market. Its new Ryzen 7000 series of CPUs are the company's biggest new product in that space since 2017 and the start of a new platform that will be supported until at least 2025.
Overall, AMD is more diversified in the gaming industry than its competitor Nvidia. The company can rely on two huge customers to sell consoles, it has less exposure in the stagnating GPU market, and its new CPU platform gives it another revenue stream from PC gamers. If you're picking one of these gaming stocks to invest in, AMD stock is the way to go.

2023-01-19 00:00:00+00:00,Can Tech Stocks Realistically Help You Retire Early?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-tech-stocks-realistically-help-you-retire-early,"Technology stocks are rarely associated with retirement plans. Retirement stocks are thought to be businesses with stability, predictable profits, and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends for income. By contrast, tech stocks are often seen as unpredictable cash-burning gambles.
As a younger investor, I was tempted to focus on simply playing it safe -- or at least what I perceived to be safe. That was until I discovered one simple principle that changed my entire perspective.
Playing it safe could cost you
I'll share the principle momentarily. But first, I'll point out that, for retirement accounts, many investors prioritize making money over beating the average return of the stock market. However, this focus can lead to questionable investing decisions.
Three companies often regarded as great retirement stocks are The JM Smucker Company, Kellogg, and Campbell Soup. All three have been in business for more than a century, pay a dividend with a better-than-average return (dividend yield), and for those who bought 10 years ago, these stocks have never been down more than 10% at any point, as the chart shows.
SJM data by YCharts
The problem is, the chart also shows that they're giving investors below-average returns. Therefore, by picking safe stocks, investors always marched higher, which is good. But they sacrificed precious upside.
For investors who only wanted positive returns and a good-paying dividend, they could have elected to invest in something like the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF. This product holds positions in many stable companies (including JM Smucker, Kellogg, and Campbell), pays quarterly distributions to fund holders, and has also maintained positive returns for more than a decade as well.
The advantage of the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF -- and many exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for that matter -- is that returns are much closer to the average of the S&P 500.
^SPX data by YCharts
Therefore, if your goal is to inch your way toward retirement without ever backtracking, investing in ETFs is probably the smartest choice to make. Certain ETFs can provide the safety you crave without sacrificing average upside.
A principle to challenge investing assumptions
Investing in ETFs can seem smart. And indeed, for many investors, it could be an important part of their overall investment strategy. But in this article, I want you to understand how important the Pareto Principle is.
The Pareto Principle basically says that 20% of inputs control 80% of outputs. And it's a principle Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger agrees with, at least loosely. Berkshire has produced astronomical returns for shareholders. But as Munger once said, ""If you took our top 15 decisions out, we'd have a pretty average record.""
In other words, a small 15 inputs accounted for the majority of Berkshire's outperformance -- the Pareto Principle at work.
The younger you are, the more you might consider approaching your journey toward retirement with this principle in mind.
Let's take three tech companies as examples: Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Let's suppose that 10 years ago, a 30-year-old investor put $10,000 in each of these companies. That would have been a phenomenal decision, fast-tracking their path to early retirement.
AAPL data by YCharts
That $30,000 total investment would be worth about $743,000 today. And at age 40, they'd be well on their way toward retirement.
Perhaps you accuse me of cherry-picking these tech stock examples. Well, I'm guilty as charged, because that's the point. There are few companies that have returned as much over the past 10 years as cherry-picked Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia. They were three of the small Pareto Principle inputs that drove the majority of returns.
Once understood, this principle can change a person's entire investment philosophy. However, there are inherent drawbacks with investing this way.
For starters, you'll probably pick many bad stocks. Moreover, your portfolio may underperform the market for periods of time.
The approach has inherent problems. But that's why the Motley Fool investing philosophy takes this into account and includes this tenant: Invest new money regularly.
Did you pick a bad stock? No problem. Try again with new money next time. This increases your chances of finding the next Nvidia.
The Motley Fool also recommends holding winning investments for a long time -- not selling quickly to ""lock in gains."" Imagine repeatedly failing with stock picks, finally stumbling upon Nvidia in 2012, and then selling it after it went up 100%. Locking in gains would have locked you out of a life-changing retirement nest egg.
If you're young and want to retire early, you'll probably need to score a few market-beating investments. Indeed, market-beating stocks will obviously get you to the finish line faster than average or below-average returns. Those market-beating stocks could come from the tech sector. But they could come from other sectors as well.
However, for the strategy to work, you need to become comfortable with a different investing mindset that embraces being wrong often and remains nevertheless resolute in being an investor for the long haul.

2023-01-20 00:00:00+00:00,Investors Heavily Search NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Here is What You Need to Know,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investors-heavily-search-nvidia-corporation-nvda%3A-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-3,"Nvidia (NVDA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +9.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 3.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share, indicating a change of -38.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.26 points to a change of -26.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.41 indicates a change of +35.1% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Nvidia.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
In the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $6.02 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.2%. The $26.94 billion and $29.47 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.1% and +9.4%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Nvidia reported revenues of $5.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -16.5%. EPS of $0.58 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.93 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.02%. The EPS surprise was -17.14%.
Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2023-01-23 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Qualcomm, Skyworks, and Nvidia Stocks Popped Today",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-qualcomm-skyworks-and-nvidia-stocks-popped-today,"What happened
Shares of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) surged higher Monday morning after international megabank Barclays upgraded two of these name-brand semiconductor stocks -- and raised its price target on the third.
As of 10:30 a.m. ET, Qualcomm has gained 5.4%, Skyworks is up 4.2%, and Nvidia -- the one chip stock that Barclays didn't upgrade (but only because it was already recommending it) -- is rising 4.4%.
So what
In a wide-ranging report encompassing most of the semiconductor sector, Barclays this morning upgraded both Qualcomm and Skyworks to overweight (i.e., buy), assigning the stocks price targets of $150 per share and $125 per share, respectively. Nvidia, which Barclays was already recommending as overweight, got a higher price target instead of an upgrade -- $250 per share, a 47% improvement over the old target price and one that promises 34% profits within a year to new buyers.
2023 is starting out rough for semiconductor investors -- but that's OK with Barclays, which is already looking ahead to 2024 with a new set of sales and earnings estimates. As the analyst reasons, chips suppliers to data centers, PC manufacturers, and mobile phone producers are likely to see better demand as the year progresses, with demand potentially improving in China in the second half of this year.
It's not all good news, however.
Warning that new car demand is just starting to fall apart, and fearing the effects of a recession on industrial demand, Barclays has a negative outlook on analog chipmakers this year. It's also curiously negative on companies that manufacture equipment for the production of semiconductor chips -- names like KLA Corporation and Applied Materials, both of which Barclays downgraded to underweight (i.e., sell) today. You might think that semiconductor companies would buy lots of equipment ahead of a resumption of demand for their products, but Barclays isn't so sure about that, warning investors not to be lulled by strong earnings at these companies early this year.
Now what
So what's an investor to make of this information?
If Barclays is right and any slump on semis will be short-lived, then Skyworks stock trading at just 13 times trailing earnings should be a safe bet -- and Qualcomm at less than 11 times earnings even safer. Nvidia stock, though, costs closer to 74 times trailing earnings today, which still seems pretty pricey. But of the three chipmakers named, Nvidia is the only one for which analysts are currently forecasting a long-term earnings growth rate in the double digits -- 21% annualized over the next five years.
That's still not fast enough to justify the valuation, in my opinion, but it's a fact worth considering.
As for the semiconductor equipment makers, I have to admit that I find Applied Materials pretty tempting at less than 15 times earnings -- Barclays' warning notwithstanding. KLA, however, both costs more than Applied Materials (about 25% more at a P/E ratio of 18.7) and has a much slower projected long-term growth rate (3% versus Applied's 10%).
In fact, out of all the stocks named above, I'm inclined to ignore Barclays' advice today and pick Applied Materials as the one most likely to outperform in the long term.

2023-01-25 00:00:00+00:00,Semiconductor ETFs in Focus Ahead of Q4 Earnings,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/semiconductor-etfs-in-focus-ahead-of-q4-earnings,"The semiconductor space has been surging over the past three months on improving demand from chips suppliers, data centers, PC manufacturers, and mobile phone producers, as well as China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained more than 30% from a two-year low in mid-October, outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, which added about 10% in the same period.

As such, Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH and First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL have gained 25.7%, 26.3%, 29.2% and 23.3%, respectively, over the past three months. The strong trend is likely to continue in the weeks ahead as the Q4 earnings season picks up pace. Texas Instruments TXN came up with robust results, beating revenue and earnings estimates for the fourth quarter. The result is expected to add fuel to the sector.

Easing inflation and hopes of a less hawkish Fed fueled the rally in the overall tech sector. Additionally, the analyst Barclays Capital upped its stance on some chip stocks ahead of earnings, suggesting that the worst might be over for semiconductors (read: Is the Worst Over for Semiconductor Stocks & ETFs?).

Semiconductors have been the most important drivers of the overall growth in technology, given the use of chips in day-to-day life from cars, electronic gadgets, to planes and weapons. The demand will continue to trend higher given the increased digitization in various corners like healthcare, transport, financial systems, defense, agriculture and retail, among others.

The rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology like cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, 5G and other advanced information technologies should continue to fuel growth. Further, the introduction of expensive and new-generation chips has been leading to an enhancement in the product mix for semiconductors.

Some other well-known players in the space, such as Intel INTC, Qualcomm QCOM, NVIDIA NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD, will report earnings in the coming days. Let’s delve into the financial picture of the companies that have a higher allocation in the above-mentioned ETFs and the power to move the funds up or down as Q4 earnings unfold. SOXQ is largely concentrated on four firms with a combined share of 28.2%, followed by 24.6% for SOXX, 23.1% for SMH and 13.6% for FTXL.

Per our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Inside Our Earnings Prediction
Intel is slated to release earnings after market close on Jan 26. It has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The stock saw negative earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Intel delivered an earnings surprise of 11.36%, on average, for the preceding four quarters.

Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -1.92%. The stock witnessed negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter and delivered an earnings surprise of 5.36% in the trailing four quarters, on average. The company is expected to report earnings after the closing bell on Feb 2 (see: all the Technology ETFs here).

NVIDIA, expected to report on Feb 22, has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3.31%, on average, over the past four quarters. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the quarter to be reported.

Advanced Micro Devices has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -0.11%. Its earnings surprise history is impressive, with the average beat being 12.20% for the preceding four quarters. The stock witnessed no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the quarter to be reported. The company is slated to report earnings on Jan 31 after the closing bell.
Conclusion
Though the stocks have an unfavorbale Zacks Rank, semiconductor ETFs might see smooth trading in the weeks ahead as SOXX, SMH and FTXL have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 or 2. This suggests outperformance in the weeks ahead (read: ETFs to Play Nasdaq's Fastest Start Since 2019).

2023-01-26 00:00:00+00:00,"This ""Golden"" Technical Indicator is Triggering Across the Market",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-golden-technical-indicator-is-triggering-across-the-market,"What is a Golden Cross?
Technical analysis is the best way for investors to determine potential trend changes in individual equities and equity markets. Though technical analysis can get complicated, simple and highly reliable signals exist for analysts who prefer “bar napkin” technical research. One such signal is the “Golden Cross”. Golden Cross refers to the phenomenon where a faster-moving average (50-day MA is most common) crosses over a slower moving average (200-day MA).

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
When a Golden Cross triggers in a particular security or index, it is a signal to technical analysts that a major trend change has occurred, and the long-term trend has flipped from bearish to bullish.
Death Cross Means Caution
On the contrary, a “Death Cross” is the opposite of a Golden Cross. A Death Cross triggers when the short-term moving average (50-day MA) is above the longer-term moving average (200-day MA) and crosses below it. In March of last year, a death cross in the Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ was an early signal that 2022 would be a rough year for bulls.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Pros and Cons of Crosses
The Golden Cross signal has many positives, which include:
·      Ease of identification: Simply bring up a daily chart of an instrument and add the 50- and 200-day MAs.
·      Eliminates Guess Work: By becoming more mechanical, investors can evaluate trend changes based on fact does not bias.
·      A Meaningful Signal:Because cross signals are rare, they are more meaningful.  
Like all signals, crosses are not perfect. Cons include:
·      Delayed Response: Since the signal is long-term, it does usually work right away.
·      False Signals:Investors should be cautious in a sideways market, as the cross can produce false signals.
  What are the Market and Key Industry Groups telling us?
In general, the pros outweigh the cons for investors looking for a largely reliable long-term signal. At present, some key markets and stocks are nearing signals or have already triggered them. For example, the Spdr S&P 500 ETF SPY, the most widely followed market ETF, is approaching a Golden Cross. A successful cross in this index would bode well for U.S. markets in 2023.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Wednesday, the Vaneck Semiconductor ETF SMH triggered a Golden Cross. Semiconductors are a key industry group and often lead the market higher. Recent strides in AI are sending stocks like Nvidia NVDA higher.

Another welcome sign is that beaten-down industries like biotech are now triggering Golden Crosses. The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF XBI is the most popular ETF tracking the space. Both large-cap and small-cap biotech stocks such as Biogen Inc BIIB and Madrigal Pharmaceuticals MDGL are participating in the rally.

Breakdown
Golden Crosses and Death Crosses have proven to be reliable indicators in past years. Investors should understand the pros and cons of the signal and accept that it is not a panacea but rather an indication of a potential trend change. Looking at today’s market, several important industry groups have already triggered Golden Crosses – though the most significant signal has yet to trigger. Watch to see if the S&P 500 can trigger a Golden Cross to confirm that the overall market has shifted back to the bull side.

2023-01-30 00:00:00+00:00,Is Seagate Technology Signaling the End of its Normalization?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-seagate-technology-signaling-the-end-of-its-normalization,"Data storage solutions giant Seagate Technology Holdings PLC (NYSE: STX) stock has been recovering since putting in a bottom of $47.47 in October 2022. Its recent fiscal Q2 2023 earnings weren't a smashing blowout, but they didn't shock investors with an extensive guide down either, as they've done in the past two earnings reports.
Investors braced themselves for another disappointment after guiding down its forecasts twice in five weeks before the end of 2022. Last year saw a cascade of warnings from storage makers, including competitor Western Digital Co. (NYSE: WDC) and DRAM producer Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU).
Even the red-hot GPU makers like NVIDIA Co. (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Co. (NYSE: AMD) experienced normalization and cut their guidance.
Seagate may have set the bar too low as they came in above and eased investor concerns with a solid performance. Shares have rocketed back to the September lip line. Did Seagate lower the bar too low to make it easier to hop over this quarter? If so, has the stock overreacted to the upside this time with its relief rally?   
Has Normalization been Completed?
Investors wonder if the normalization from the pandemic demand shock has finally been completed. Markets overshoot to the upside and the downside. It's no secret that the pandemic triggered unprecedented demand for storage and chips. Stay-at-home mandates caused a demand shock further perpetuated by the supply shock during the reopening.
 Normalization is a reversion back to the mean process. Many tech companies have forecast the normalization to continue towards the middle of 2023.
Could the hangover that started in 2022 finally be in the rearview mirror? Is this a sign that the recovery is near or here? Remember that Seagate's fiscal year is two quarters ahead of its actual calendar year results.
Therefore, this fiscal Q2 2023 report was based on calendar year Q4 2022 results. They had noted that the normalization would continue through the first half of the new year. On the other hand, markets tend to react based on the next quarter or two.  
Calming Investor Sentiment
On Jan. 25, 2023, Seagate released its fiscal second-quarter 2023 results for the quarter that ended in December 2022. The Company reported a non-GAAP diluted earnings-per-share (EPS) profit of $0.16, beating consensus analyst estimates of $0.09 by $0.07. GAAP diluted EPS loss was (-$0.16), which reflects non-recurring charges taken in the quarter related to the restructuring.
Revenues fell (39.4%) year-over-year (YOY) to $1.89 billion, beating analyst estimates of $1.83 billion. Capex was reduced by more than (40%) sequentially. The Company reduced debt to $6 billion, down ($220 million). The quarter ended with 206 million ordinary shares and $770 million in cash and cash equivalents.
Inline Guidance
Seagate kept its fiscal Q3 2023 guidance in line with an EPS expected between $0.05 to $0.45 versus $0.30 consensus analyst estimates. The Company sees revenues of $1.85 billion to $2.15 billion versus $1.88 billion analyst estimates. 
CEO Comments
Seagate Technology CEO Dave Mosley commented, ""Seagate is effectively managing through a tough macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue and non-GAAP EPS slightly above our guidance midpoint in the December quarter and extended a decade-long trend of generating positive free cash flow.” He explained that they are in an industry-leading position that positions them well for eventual market recovery. Seagate will roll out its 30-plus terabyte (TB) HAMR-based products enabled by 3-plus TB per disk densities in June.
Are Headwinds Dying Down?
CEO Mosley pointed out that three headwinds were the main culprit behind the slowdown. The China COVID-related slowdowns, bloated HDD inventories among cloud and enterprise customers, and a more cautious macroeconomic environment caused customers to tighten spending.
Two of the three may improve as China relaxes zero-COVID restrictions and U.S. companies work through their HDD inventories. The economy is the wildcard, but the U.S. Fed is closer to pausing rate hikes now than they were two quarters ago.
Weekly Rounding Bottom
STX weekly candlestick chart has been forming a rounding bottom, which has been the running theme with tech stocks in 2023. Shares started their descent off the $69.85 lip line in September 2022, bottoming out at $47.47 by October 2022. The weekly stochastic pushed back up through the 20-band to finally trigger the weekly market structure low (MSL) breakout through $55.77 in December 2022.
The stochastic has made a complete oscillation through the 80-band are shares rocketed through the weekly 50-period exponential moving average (EMA) at $59.33 to test the $69.85 lip line in its move towards the weekly 50-period MA resistance at $71.81.
A breakout through the lip line would trigger a retest of the weekly market structure high (MSH) sell trigger at $78.04. Pullback support levels are $62.78, $59.89, $55.77 weekly MSL trigger, and $53.51.

2023-01-31 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Just Sounded a Warning Bell. Here's What It Means for Nvidia and AMD Stocks.,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-just-sounded-a-warning-bell.-heres-what-it-means-for-nvidia-and-amd-stocks.,"The economy has been the single biggest factor driving Wall Street over the past year with technology stocks taking the biggest beating. Investors have been watching financial reports closely for indications of where things might go from here and paying particular attention to what executives have to say about the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds. So when Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) reported its earnings, management's commentary took on a whole new importance.
While the company's results were disappointing, it was what executives had to say about the future that turned heads. Management's comments suggest tough times lie ahead -- not only for Intel but for rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) as well.

A swing and a miss
Investors were expecting the challenging macroeconomic conditions to affect Intel's results, but things were worse than many anticipated. Fourth-quarter revenue of $14.0 billion fell 32% year over year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.10, which plunged 92%. To give those numbers context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $14.5 billion and EPS of $0.20, so Intel's results missed the mark by a wide margin.
Fueling the dismal results were challenges across Intel's largest segments. Revenue from the client computing group (PCs and laptops) slumped 36% year over year to $6.6 billion, while data center and artificial intelligence revenue fell 33% to $4.3 billion. The network and edge segment held up better but still edged 1% lower to $2.1 billion.
Yet as disappointing as the financial results were, it was Intel's outlook that spooked investors across the semiconductor industry.
The big bad
Intel's outlook was the first shoe to drop. In the first quarter, management expects revenue to fall 40% to $11.0 billion at the midpoint of its guidance while swinging to an adjusted loss per share of $0.15, compared to EPS of $1.34 in the prior-year quarter.
The speed at which Intel's business fell off a cliff took the market by surprise, sending many Intel investors running for the exits. Perhaps more alarming, however, was when the second shoe dropped -- management's comments about what it expects from the economy in 2023.
Intel said it expects ""persistent economic headwinds through at least the first half of 2023."" While that part wasn't a surprise, comments from CEO Pat Gelsinger about the state of the data center market raised eyebrows (emphasis mine).
""We expect Q1 server consumption TAM [total addressable market] to decline both sequentially and year over year at an accelerated rate, with 2023's first-half server consumption TAM down year on year, before returning to growth in the second half,"" Gelsinger said on the earnings call.
While that's not the end of the world, it highlights the growing importance of the data center market to the semiconductor industry, and what it could mean for upcoming results.
Things could get ugly for Nvidia and AMD
To understand the implications for Nvidia, one need only review its recent results and the challenges. For the first nine months of fiscal 2023 (which started Jan. 31, 2022), the data center segment was responsible for 54% of Nvidia's total revenue, up from 39% in fiscal 2022.
Furthermore, in its fiscal 2023 third quarter (ended Oct. 30, 2022), Nvidia's data center segment did all the heavy lifting as revenue grew 31% year over year to $3.8 billion. At the same time, gaming revenue -- which has historically represented the lion's share of Nvidia's sales -- plunged 51% to $1.6 billion. Overall, revenue of $5.9 billion tumbled 17%.
AMD's results have held up better so far this year, but the company is similarly dependent on its data center business. The segment represented 24% of its revenue during the first nine months of 2022, compared to 22% during the prior-year period.
Context matters
While it's easy to see why Nvidia and AMD investors would be nervous, it's important to put this information in context. It was just May of last year that Nvidia and AMD each reported record quarterly sales with revenue growing 46% and 71%, respectively. The timing of their decelerating revenue growth coincides with the downturn in the macroeconomic environment. This suggests that Nvidia and AMD will get their groove back once the economy regains its footing.
It's also important to remember that investing is a marathon, not a sprint. While there will no doubt be challenges ahead, over the long term, Nvidia and AMD have proven their mettle. In fact, I'd argue that three to five years from now, investors who held their ground -- or even bought shares of Nvidia or AMD -- will be glad they did.

2023-02-02 00:00:00+00:00,3 Ultra-Profitable Businesses to Invest in for the Long Haul,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-ultra-profitable-businesses-to-invest-in-for-the-long-haul,"One thing you should always consider when choosing a stock is how profitable the underlying business is. If its profit margins are low, then it could easily swing to a loss if it faces headwinds or the economy as a whole struggles. A higher profit margin can also create an important buffer for the business, allowing it to reduce prices if it needs to be more competitive or to better handle inflationary pressures.
Three businesses that are performing exceptionally well with profit margins of 20% and higher include AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Visa (NYSE: V). These are stocks that should do well this year regardless of inflation and could make for excellent long-term investments.
1. AbbVie
Drugmaker AbbVie has reported $13.3 billion in earnings over the trailing 12 months, which is nearly one-quarter (23%) of its top line of $57.8 billion during that time. The business has been expanding over the years, helped by its $63 billion purchase of Botox-maker Allergan in 2019, which diversifies its operations and gives it a new growth opportunity.
Between immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care, and other products, AbbVie's business looks solid and poised for more growth in the years ahead.
While investors are concerned with the looming patent cliff for Humira, its top-selling rheumatoid arthritis medication, management is confident that immunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq combined can ultimately make up for the loss in revenue.
The healthcare company's rock-solid operations have enabled AbbVie to generate free cash flow of just under $22 billion over the past year, putting it in great shape to withstand any headwinds that may come up.
2. Nvidia
Chipmaker Nvidia has made for a solid growth investment over the years, and it hasn't compromised profitability along the way. Sales for fiscal 2022 (which ended on Jan. 31, 2022) totaled $26.9 billion and were more than double the $10.9 billion that the company reported just a few years earlier.
The growing popularity of crypto and more companies moving more of their operations online, in part due to the pandemic, have led to stronger demand for faster and better computers.
What's impressive is that at $9.8 billion, the company's profit margin was an incredible 36% of its top line during its most recent fiscal year. Although profits have come under pressure due to rising labor costs and worsening supply chain issues, its profit margin has still been impressive at 21% over the trailing 12 months.
Concerns about softening demand for personal computers has made many investors bearish on the stock of late, but in the long run this is still a fantastic business to invest in -- Nvidia is a top name in graphics cards and that's not likely to change anytime soon.
3. Visa
Credit card companies are among the most profitable businesses in the world. While there's always a risk of consumer default, these businesses are good at hedging risk and setting aside money for that danger.
In January, Visa released numbers for its fiscal 2023's first quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2022), and net revenue grew 15% to $7.9 billion when excluding the impact of foreign currency. Profits totaling $4.2 billion were up by just 6% but still represented an impressive 53% of the top line.
With Visa generating numbers like that amid inflation and when concerns are rising about the health of the consumer, those are some impressive results. Although it may not be as high of a growth rate as in previous quarters for Visa, the business still looks to be in fantastic shape.
And as the economy strengthens, its bottom line could improve even further, making this an even better buy right now before that happens.

2023-02-03 00:00:00+00:00,It’s the Perfect Time to Buy Amazon Stock,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/its-the-perfect-time-to-buy-amazon-stock,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
[Editor’s note: “It’s the Perfect Time to Buy Amazon Stock” was previously published in January 2023. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]
I’m no long-term fan of Big Tech stocks. Earlier last year, I made the bold claim that Big Tech stocks were dead, calling for the demise of giants like Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN).
Through January of this year, those stocks had all collapsed more than 37%. And after the recent round of earnings reports, those titans are starting to rise again. But they’re all still down more than 14%.
At this time last year, Big Tech stocks were still loved as unstoppable growth giants, trading at lofty valuations that priced in perfection. That was the time to sell them.
Now, though, we have a completely different setup.
Big Tech stocks have crashed. Once unstoppable, they are now vulnerable. Before, they traded at lofty valuations that priced in perfection. And now, they’re trading at discounted valuations that price in little to no growth.
Yet, many of these firms still represent some of the biggest, most successful, and most profitable enterprises to ever exist.
Now’s the time to buy Big Tech stocks. That’s just what you do with long-term winners. You sell them when they are overhyped and undervalued. You buy them when they are underappreciated and undervalued.
Right now, those stocks are underappreciated and undervalued. So, let’s buy this dip.
One Big Tech stock we’re particularly bullish on here and now is Amazon stock.
Amazon Is still Amazon
After reporting quarterly earnings on Thursday, AMZN stock sank about 4.5%. The giant beat on revenue, but missed on EPS and provided light guidance. Most notable to the media and many investors alike, the titan missed on net sales in its cloud division ($21.3 billion actual versus $21.76 billion expected).
Amazon’s recent quarter wasn’t awful or horrible. Yes, EPS and sales missed expectations, and the cloud business did slow sequentially. But that cloud business is still growing revenues at a 20% year-over-year clip. And it slowed in line with the cloud slowdowns at Alphabet and Apple (AAPL) – so Amazon Web Services isn’t losing share. The cloud industry is just going through a temporary cyclical slowdown that will reverse course when the economy improves.
Nothing worrisome there at all.
Meanwhile, the ad business actually saw its growth rates accelerate in the quarter to 19%. Against the backdrop of Meta and Alphabet’s YouTube division reporting negative ad revenue growth, that’s very impressive. Amazon’s ad business is clearly gaining significant market share.
Plus, the company’s physical store business continues to grow steadily.
Sure, profit margins are under pressure, and broadly, revenue growth rates are slowing. But that’s almost entirely a function of FX headwinds, which are likely to abate in the coming quarters.
So, when you put it all together, Amazon is still a leader in the secular growth cloud industry. And it’s a share-gainer in the secular growth digital ad industry. Amazon remains a behemoth of a company.
When a behemoth of a company like this goes on sale, it’s time to buy. And Amazon stock is finally on sale.
Buy this dip.
Amazon Stock Is Super Cheap
After its recent plunge, Amazon stock has become dirt-cheap – cheap enough to warrant buying the dip now.
The stock is trading around 2.2X trailing sales, below the stock’s five-year-average multiple of around 3.4X. That’s also the lowest valuation multiple for the stock since 2015 – before the company’s cloud business caught fire and made the firm consistently profitable.
Source: macrotrends
That multiple is just too low for this stock. To illustrate why, let’s model the business out five years.
Amazon’s online retail business will likely grow at a fairly steady 10% annualized clip over the next few years. The physical store business is good for about 5% growth per year. The ad business will likely grow around 20% per year, representative of market share expansion in a 10% to 15% growth industry. And the cloud business will likely grow around 25% per year, in line with market estimates for cloud spending growth.
Altogether, this is a company with clear visibility to mid-teens revenue growth over the next five years. Operating margins have room to expand to 10%, as the high-margin ad and cloud businesses comprise a bigger slice of the sales pie. When you run the math on those projections, it becomes clear that Amazon will easily be able to net about $8 in earnings per share by 2027.
Slap a simple 20X forward earnings multiple on that. That implies a 2026 price target of $160 for Amazon stock. Discount that back by 10% per year. You arrive at a 2023 price target around $120.
Amazon stock trades around $108 today. High-quality firms like Amazon rarely – if ever – trade below their fair value. When they do, you simply must take advantage.
So, do yourself a favor, and buy this dip with high conviction.
The Final Word
The current phenomenon happening in Amazon stock is a microcosm of what’s happening across the entire stock market.
Due to cyclical fears related to a potential recession, dozens of super high-quality stocks with growing revenues, profits, and cash flows are seeing their stock prices get crushed.
This happens all the time. About once a decade, investors start worrying about a potential recession. High-quality stocks see their prices get crushed – but their revenues, earnings, and cash flows keep growing. Investors who buy the dip in those stocks end up making a ton of money – because they always bounce back in a big way.
This time will prove no different. Investors who buy the dip in high-quality stocks that were crushed in 2022 will make a ton of money in 2023 and ‘24. It’s that simple.
Amazon stock is one such investment. But it is far from the only one.
And we believe what comes next is a big rally, so the window to capitalize on these stock price divergences is rapidly closing.
Is your portfolio positioned for this rare trading phenomenon?
Let us tell you about the best stocks to buy to play this great divergence.

2023-02-06 00:00:00+00:00,AI Mania: 3 Rare Pure Plays to Monitor,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ai-mania%3A-3-rare-pure-plays-to-monitor,"The Emergence of AI
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has garnered widespread attention from users and investors after the viral rollout of the AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT. To give you an idea of how successful the launch has been, ChatGPT is now the fastest consumer app to reach 100 million active users – taking just two months to reach the milestone. As a result of the meteoric rise to popularity, privately held ChatGPT creator OpenAI has secured more than $10 billion in investments from Microsoft MSFT.
Companies like Amazon AMZN have been using AI under the hood for years. For example, Amazon leverages AI on its back end to increase sales on its e-commerce platform (if you add a table to your shopping cart, it will suggest chairs). Microsoft is not the only publicly traded company making bold bets in the AI space to compensate. The emergence of ChatGPT has exhibited not only the power and versatility of AI technology but also the threat to existing tech juggernauts. AI technology may not only disrupt technology, but it is also likely to impact investments. The recent awakening is causing tech giants such as Alphabet GOOGL to take notice but and action. Friday, Alphabet announced an investment of $300 million in AI start-up Anthropic. Meanwhile, International Business Machines IBM has been on a spending spree of its own, attempting to bolster the firm’s AI presence by acquiring a handful of small AI-centric firms in recent months.   
Can AI Move the Needle?
Though the new investments by the dominant tech players are significant from a dollar perspective, they are unlikely to move the needle in the short term for a company like Alphabet, which has a market cap of over $1 trillion, or Microsoft, which has a market cap of nearly $2 trillion.
Because the technological advances in the space are still relatively new and many companies are privately held and small in size, investors are left with little in the way of AI stocks to choose from. Fortunately, there are three public companies that recently IPOed and are pure plays on emerging technology, including:
1.   C3.ai Inc AI: C3.ai is an enterprise AI software provider that aims to develop, deploy, and operate large-scale AI, predictive analytics, and IoT applications. Since going public, the stock’s performance has been dismal. AI traded as high as $180 in its third week of trading in 2020, only to crash to as low as $10 last year.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
However, the recent AI hype, rising revenue, and a narrower than anticipated loss in the company’s recent earnings report have driven shares higher and changed the character of the stock. Over the past three months, the stock is up by more than 100% on massive volume. Surprisingly, more shares traded hands last week than the week of the IPO.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Though C3 has yet to turn a profit as a public company, its revenue has been growing for several quarters, and the company has onboarded some impressive clients including, the U.S. Airforce, utility giant Consolidated Edison Inc ED, and Koch Industries (the second largest privately held company in the United States).
At present, avoid shares of C3 because they are extended in price and hold a lowly Zacks Ranking of 4. Nevertheless, investors should keep an eye on the stock over the coming months. C3 is one of the few AI pure plays available to public investors, and the recent buying pressure in shares suggests that investors are anticipating a turnaround.
2.   Veritone Inc VERI: Veritone is a firm that runs a proprietary cloud-based digital asset management platform focused on leveraging AI technology and its benefits to clients in the media, politics, legal, and law enforcement industries. Veritone’s niche in digital asset management has attracted some noteworthy clients, such as the Los Angeles Chargers football organization. The Chargers have more than 60 years of video content stored. Organizing such a large amount of content can be a headache and requires several employees and a lot of money. That is until they took advantage of Veritone’s platform. Veritone’s solution organizes, stores, and makes the content searchable, like Google.
Like C3, Veritone has taken investors on a rollercoaster ride since coming public in 2017. With that said, the stock has been on the rebound and has garnered the attention of investors in recent weeks.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Veritone has only produced one profitable quarter since going public. That said, top-line growth has been strong – VERI has consistently achieved mid to high double-digit revenue growth since going public.  
3.   Bigbear AI Holdings BBAI: Bigbear.ai is a provider of artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud-based analytics, and cyber engineering solutions. Through AI, Bigbear aims to provide its clients with a clearer view of their current data, better predictability of future outcomes, and “pathways to navigate changing conditions.” Like Veritone and C3, BBAI gets its revenue from various industries, including government (intelligence analysis), healthcare, and manufacturing. BBAI shares have gone on an impressive run over the past few weeks – rocketing from a low of $0.58 to a high of around $6. However, the company is tiny, unprofitable, and holds a poor Zacks rating of 4.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Takeaway
For now, the current AI craze loosely echoes “blockchain mania” from a few years ago. During this period, any company with “blockchain” in its name rocketed higher as the speculative juices began to flow on Wall Street. In 2017, Long Island Iced Tea Corp switched its branding to “Long Blockchain Corp” to benefit from the hype. Ultimately current earnings power and future earnings runway began to matter again in the blockchain stocks, and I suspect the same will happen in AI–related stocks. The likely scenario in the stocks mentioned above is that they have benefitted from hype, small floats, and speculation in recent weeks.
Nevertheless, it never hurts to begin researching a novel, innovative industry such as AI. For pure plays, patience is required. Secondary beneficiaries such as Nvidia NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD currently have more favorable reward-to-risk profiles.

Since going public, the stock’s performance has been dismal. AI traded as high as $180 in its third week of trading in 2020, only to crash to as low as $10 last year.
However, the recent AI hype, rising revenue, and a narrower than anticipated loss in the company’s recent earnings report have driven shares higher and changed the character of the stock. Over the past three months, the stock is up by more than 100% on massive volume. Surprisingly, more shares traded hands last week than the week of the IPO.
Though C3 has yet to turn a profit as a public company, its revenue has been growing for several quarters, and the company has onboarded some impressive clients including, the U.S. Airforce, utility giant Consolidated Edison and Koch Industries (the second largest privately held company in the United States).
At present, avoid shares of C3 because they are extended in price and hold a lowly Zacks Ranking of 4. Nevertheless, investors should keep an eye on the stock over the coming months. C3 is one of the few AI pure plays available to public investors, and the recent buying pressure in shares suggests that investors are anticipating a turnaround.
2.   Veritone Inc: Veritone is a firm that runs a proprietary cloud-based digital asset management platform focused on leveraging AI technology and its benefits to clients in the media, politics, legal, and law enforcement industries. Veritone’s niche in digital asset management has attracted some noteworthy clients, such as the Los Angeles Chargers football organization. The Chargers have more than 60 years of video content stored.
Organizing such a large amount of content can be a headache and requires several employees and a lot of money. That is until they took advantage of Veritone’s platform. Veritone’s solution organizes, stores, and makes the content searchable, like Google.
Like C3, Veritone has taken investors on a rollercoaster ride since coming public in 2017. With that said, the stock has been on the rebound and has garnered the attention of investors in recent weeks.
Veritone has only produced one profitable quarter since going public. That said, top-line growth has been strong – VERI has consistently achieved mid to high double-digit revenue growth since going public.  
3.   Bigbear AI Holdings: Bigbear.ai is a provider of artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud-based analytics, and cyber engineering solutions. Through AI, Bigbear aims to provide its clients with a clearer view of their current data, better predictability of future outcomes, and “pathways to navigate changing conditions.”
Like Veritone and C3, BBAI gets its revenue from various industries, including government (intelligence analysis), healthcare, and manufacturing. BBAI shares have gone on an impressive run over the past few weeks – rocketing from a low of $0.58 to a high of around $6. However, the company is tiny, unprofitable, and holds a poor Zacks rating of 4.
Takeaway
For now, the current AI craze loosely echoes “blockchain mania” from a few years ago. During this period, any company with “blockchain” in its name rocketed higher as the speculative juices began to flow on Wall Street. In 2017, Long Island Iced Tea Corp switched its branding to “Long Blockchain Corp” to benefit from the hype. Ultimately current earnings power and future earnings runway began to matter again in the blockchain stocks, and I suspect the same will happen in AI–related stocks. The likely scenario in the stocks mentioned above is that they have benefitted from hype, small floats, and speculation in recent weeks.
Nevertheless, it never hurts to begin researching a novel, innovative industry such as AI. For pure plays, patience is required. Secondary beneficiaries such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices currently have more favorable reward-to-risk profiles.

2023-02-08 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Jumped 34% in January,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-jumped-34-in-january,"What happened
Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the chip maker best known for its graphics processors, were soaring last month as the company seemed to benefit from a broader turnaround in tech stocks and as interest built in all things artificial intelligence (AI)-related following the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT.
According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock finished the month up 34%.
As you can see from the chart below, the stock gained steadily over the course of the month, significantly outpacing the Nasdaq, which jumped 11%.
NVDA data by YCharts.
So what
There was little company-specific news out on Nvidia last month, but after the stock plunged 50% last year, investors seemed to spy a buying opportunity as market sentiment shifted in January.
Another Consumer Price Index report showing the inflation rate continuing to come down encouraged investors that the market could rebound without a deep recession, and confidence built that the Federal Reserve would slow down its interest rate hikes. At its meeting on Feb. 1, it did just that when it raised rates by just 25 basis points, its lowest increase in nearly a year.
Nvidia shares also seemed to move higher as interest surged in artificial intelligence following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November and as Microsoft and Alphabet both declared a pivot to AI, signaling that a new tech race was on in chat-powered search and other AI categories.
AI stocks like C3.ai also jumped toward the end of the month, and Nvidia seemed to catch a tailwind because it's generally considered the leader in AI chips. A majority of its revenue also comes from chips for data centers, which are expected to be in high demand as AI becomes the next frontier in technology.
Now what
Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and revenue is falling across the board due to an inventory glut. Recent reports from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices made clear that the fourth quarter is likely to be a challenging one for Nvidia.
Still, the company once again seems to be at the right place at the right time in the chip sector and is likely to benefit from the boom in artificial intelligence.
We'll learn more when Nvidia reports fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 22. Analysts are expecting another decline in revenue, calling for the top line to slide 21.4% to $6.01 billion and earnings per share to shrink from $1.32 to $0.81. However, investors will also be keen to hear management's comments on the evolution of AI, as that will be a greater determinant of the company's long-term performance.

2023-02-09 00:00:00+00:00,3 Red-Hot Stocks That Could Continue to Beat the Market,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-red-hot-stocks-that-could-continue-to-beat-the-market-5,"Generally speaking, investors want to own a piece of companies with real growth prospects and proven staying power. If they do, stocks' prices will eventually take care of themselves. Conversely, chasing a hot stock simply because it's hot is rarely a great idea. When unsupported rallies take a turn for the worse, the turns can become mighty painful.
There are cases, however, where a red-hot stock rally really is an indication of the company's underlying strength. At the very least, these stocks are worth a closer look. Here's a rundown of three such recently hot prospects you might want to consider for your portfolio.
1. Nvidia
It would be easy to assume the worst of chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) right now. Not only are the warning bells of a semiconductor supply crisis still ringing, but macroeconomic weakness tends to take an exaggerated toll on the technology sector. Revenue for its fiscal 2023 third quarter (ended Oct. 30) dropped 17%, and the top line for its recently ended Q4 is projected to fall over 21%. Sales for the quarter currently underway are expected to slide even more.
And yet, the stock's up nearly 50% over the past month, and still steaming higher.
Why the discrepancy? Two things.
First, much of the recent rally is related to the overzealous selling seen in 2022. The market's just correcting its mistake. Second, investors are seeing the bigger picture, recognizing Nvidia's longer-term potential is incredible despite the current turbulence.
It's easy to overlook, but this company isn't just making graphics cards for video gamers anymore. Data center processors are its biggest business now, and most of its data center offerings are artificial intelligence (AI) computing platforms. That's a very resilient, high-growth arena. Precedence Research predicts the AI hardware market will grow at an average annualized pace of nearly 27% through 2030. Market research outfit Omdia estimates that around 80% of the world's artificial intelligence processors are already made by Nvidia, so it's clearly got the right stuff to help hold onto this dominant degree of market share.
2. Tapestry
It's curious. Consumers are seemingly losing interest in expensive fashion labels, while appreciation for value and quality is growing. Traffic at mall-based department stores also continues to wane as the world finds other, more cost-effective and efficient means of shopping. The shift seemingly works against luxury clothing and accessory specialists like Tapestry (NYSE: TPR), which owns brands such as Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman.
Yet it continues to persevere. While initially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, sales for the fiscal year ending in mid-2021 were up an impressive 16%. They grew the same amount for the next 12 months. Revenue is on pace to roll in a little below last year's top line for fiscal 2023 ending in June, but it is then predicted to accelerate again. Oh, and the company is increasingly profitable despite stiff inflation and a wobbly economy.
The explanation for this unlikely success is simple enough: This isn't your mother's (or your grandmother's) Coach and Kate Spade.
It's admittedly so subtle that it's difficult to see. This company, however, is truly connecting with consumers willing and able to spend a bit more than average for access to luxury. It does a significant amount of repair and refurbishment business, for instance, appealing to the buyer that's also worried about the fashion business's impact on the environment. At the same time, Tapestry's management understands its current core customers -- Gen-Z -- are looking to fashion as an expression of their individual style as much as they're looking for affordable luxury.
And yes, it all makes a difference. While Goldman Sachs concedes the average consumer is strapped right now, the investment bank's researchers suggest shoppers are more likely to spend less on basic goods like denim so they can continue to purchase higher-end handbags.
3. SolarEdge Technologies
Finally, add SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ: SEDG) to your list of red-hot stocks that may not be slowing down anytime soon. Its shares notched a 46% gain in the past three months, including a 13% advance over just the past month.
If you're not familiar, SolarEdge makes power inverters for solar panels. The solar panels collect the sun's electricity-producing photons, and inverters like the ones made by SolarEdge convert them into the usable AC electricity being piped to your home's light fixtures and wall sockets. As it turns out, while they're generally efficient enough, poorly conceived inverters have been as big of hurdle to mainstreaming solar power as relatively inefficient panels were at one point. Not only can SolarEdge's inverters be easily managed with an app, but they also integrate nicely with solar's common add-ons like EV chargers and battery-based power storage.
There's never been a better time to be in the business, either. New legislation turned into federal law in the middle of last year boosts the industry in a big way. Namely, the Defense Production Act encourages more domestic production of solar panels, while the Inflation Reduction Act offers generous tax credits for all facets of new solar power system installations. Much of the rest of the world is taking similar stimulative measures as well.
These tailwinds are expected to make a major impact, too. The International Energy Agency indicates the planet's annual pace of solar panel installations will quadruple between 2022 and 2030. This market growth is a key reason SolarEdge Technologies' top line is expected to have grown by nearly 60% last year, and will likely rise another 30% this year.

2023-02-10 00:00:00+00:00,SoftBank's Arm China lays off workers as outlook grim -sources,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/softbanks-arm-china-lays-off-workers-as-outlook-grim-sources,"By Jane Lanhee Lee, Josh Horwitz and Stephen Nellis
OAKLAND, Calif/SHANGHAI Feb 13 (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp's 9984.T chip technology firm Arm Ltd's China joint venture laid off 90-95 employees last week to cope with a challenging business outlook this year, according to three sources familiar with the situation.
The layoffs come as SoftBank tries to set up a public listing for Arm this year. The China market has been a major source of growth, although a two-year management dispute at the joint venture that resulted in the ousting of the former CEO created some challenges.
Two of the sources said those who lost their jobs were mostly engineers in research and development. Before the layoffs, Arm China had about 700 employees; there were no layoffs last year when parent Arm Ltd had global layoffs affecting up to 15% of its workforce, according to one of the sources.
Arm China declined to comment.
Last year's layoffs came after Nvidia Corp NVDA.O failed to take over Arm because of regulatory hurdles. The collapse of the sale marked a major setback for SoftBank's efforts to generate funds when valuations across its portfolio are under pressure.
Arm China is the exclusive distributor of Arm licenses in China. It collects payments, and sends them to Arm Ltd, which delivers the technology directly to customers.
One of the sources said some customers are concerned about Arm potentially changing how it charges royalties, as well as U.S.-China geopolitical tensions that could cut off access to Arm technology.
Chinese companies, including Huawei Group and Alibaba, have been restricted from using some of Arm's technology in recent years.

2023-02-13 00:00:00+00:00,US STOCKS-Wall Street ends higher as investors eye inflation data,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-street-ends-higher-as-investors-eye-inflation-data,"By Noel Randewich
Feb 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed higher on Monday as investors awaited inflation data likely to hint at the path of the Federal Reserve's future interest rate hikes, while Meta Platforms gained after a report that the Facebook parent was planning fresh layoffs.
MetaMETA.O jumped after the Financial Times reported on Sunday that the company was preparing to announce a new round of job cuts, adding to layoffs last November.
Microsoft MSFT.O, Nvidia NVDA.O, Apple AAPL.O and Amazon AMZN.O also gained. Along with Meta, those tech-related heavyweights contributed more than any other stocks to the S&P 500's gains for the session.
Helping lift Microsoft, Stifel raised its price target on the software company and said it is clearly looking to upend Alphabet's Google search dominance through its integration with ChatGPT.
Investors are laser-focused on January inflation data due on Tuesday to reassess their bets on the central bank's monetary policy path.
Wall Street's main indexes lost ground last week after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that interest rates may need to move higher than expected in the central bank's battle against inflation.
""Today is just a natural reaction in the opposite direction after we've seen very heavy selling pressure,"" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta.
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 46.50 points, or 1.15%, to end at 4,137.48 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC gained 174.12 points, or 1.49%, to 11,892.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 374.45 points, or 1.11%, to 34,243.72.
So far in this year, the S&P 500 has gained about 8%, and the index remains down about 14% from its record high close in January 2022.
Fidelity National Information Services IncFIS.N plunged following the banking and payments processing conglomerate's decision to spin off its merchant payments business.
Coca-Cola KO.N rose ahead of its quarterly report due out early on Tuesday.
As U.S. quarterly earnings reports wind down, 69% of the S&P 500 firms that have reported results so far have exceeded profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data. Analysts expect December-quarter earnings to have fallen nearly 3% from a year earlier.

2023-02-15 00:00:00+00:00,The Large Cap Rally Is Largely About These 3 Stocks,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-large-cap-rally-is-largely-about-these-3-stocks,"If this year’s stock market were likened to a weight lifting exercise, it would be a shoulder shrug.
Investors shrugged off recession talk and mixed earnings reports on Monday to erase much of last week’s losses. It was another example of a ‘buy the dip’ mentality that has prevailed thus far in 2023 — and has the S&P 500 up 8% year-to-date.
As global equities continue to drift from their October 2022 low, broad sector participation lends credence to the recovery. All 11 GICS sectors have advanced since October 13th. The industrials, financials, materials and technology groups are each up at least 20%.
For U.S. large caps, the bull run has also been well attended at the sector level, but a select few mega caps have the biggest impact. Warner Bros. Discovery, Catalent and Align Tech have gained more than 50%, but their small S&P 500 weightings limit their overall contribution.  The benchmark’s largest components — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon — are up in 2023, but aren’t having the same influence as in years past. 
With a combined weighting of more than 4%, its strength in these three tickers that have much to do with the S&P’s 2023 performance.
Tesla’s Prices Are Falling…Why Is the Stock Rising? 
Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) accounts for nearly 1% of the S&P 500’s 8% year-to-date return. No other company in the index is off to a hotter start. 
The EV leader found another gear after it reported 40% earnings growth for the fourth quarter. The result surpassed Wall Street’s expectations and demonstrated positive vehicle production and delivery trends. Better profits in the less-discussed Energy Generation & Storage business also helped push Tesla over the top.
In contrast to the higher average selling prices for Tesla’s sedans and SUVs witnessed in Q4, price cuts have been the theme in the current quarter. As much as $13,000 was slashed from the Model 3 and Model Y stickers in the U.S., and similar rollbacks have been implemented in the Greater China market. 
Tesla’s shift from being a luxury brand for the affluent to an affordable brand for the masses has been remarkable. From 2017 to 2022, the average price on a Tesla EV was halved. During the same period, operating margins went from red to black. This long-term trend has investors unfazed by the recent price cuts and Tesla at the front of the S&P 500 race.
Which Company Is Driving the Semiconductor Rally?
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) has roughly the same weighting as Tesla in the S&P 500. Its 49% year-to-date climb is a big reason why stocks are off to their best start since 2019. The chipmaker is also leading a resurgence in semiconductors which, alongside auto manufacturers, is this year’s best-performing industry. It’s a fitting duo given NVIDIA’s recent push into the auto market.
Last month, the company announced that it joined forces with the world’s leading tech manufacturer Foxconn to develop automated EVs. Foxconn will produce electronic control units (ECUs) based on the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin chip. The technology will present automakers with an all-in-one solution for self-driving capabilities and an AI command center.
Although NVIDIA’s automotive segment is a small part of the business, this is a significant step towards being an influential tech player in the global EV and autonomous vehicle markets.
Whether or not the volatile stock’s recent gains hold up will likely depend on next week’s earnings release. If management can show continued strength in data centers and an improvement in gaming, NVIDIA could overtake Tesla as this year’s top S&P stock. If the report is disappointing, look for it to have a significant drag on market direction.
Is Meta Platforms Stock Headed Back to $200?
Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) gapped up in good volume on better-than-feared fourth-quarter revenue. Despite continued weakness in advertising demand, the market felt the worst might be over for Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. 
Some $4.2 billion in cost cutting measures tied to layoffs, facilities consolidation and nixing several data center projects helped Meta Platform reduce its 2023 expense guidance. This was the report's highlight because it showed expense reductions are working and profits could improve as the economy does the same. 
The stock’s 23% post-earnings jump was supported by a favorable regulatory ruling on the same day of the report. A federal judge shot down the FTC’s request to block Meta’s takeover of virtual reality fitness game maker Within Limited.
The FTC’s assertion that this would limit competition in the VR fitness app market proved unfounded. Being able to proceed with the deal for the Supernatural app maker is significant for two reasons: 1) the app’s popularity will give Meta Platform a major inroad to the fast-growing VR space, and 2) an antitrust victory of any magnitude bodes well for Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse ambitions.
Meta shares have sold off since reaching their highest level since June 2022 but, up 49% year-to-date, are having a big impact on the overall market. The consensus price target points to a potential return to $200, with some analysts forecasting a push toward $300.

Feb 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were on track to open sharply lower on Thursday after stronger-than-expected producer prices data fed into fears that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates to tame stubbornly high inflation.
A Labor Department report showed producer prices climbed 0.7% in January after a 0.2% fall in the previous month. Economists polled by Reuters expected a 0.4% increase in January.
Another set showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, offering more evidence of the economy's resilience despite the tighter monetary policy.
""You're seeing the inflation numbers continue to be higher than expected and not really showing disinflation and now the expectations are that the Fed is likely to take rates higher and be more aggressive going forward,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance at Charlotte, North Carolina.
""You're also seeing the job market still very strong as well, with claims coming in less than expected,"" Zaccarelli added.
After a torrid 2022, the main stock indexes have climbed this year on the back of upbeat earnings and expectations that the U.S. central bank will switch to smaller rate hikes, pushing investors to scoop up beaten-down growth stocks.
However, signs of a resilient economy and an acceleration in January consumer prices recently raised concerns among traders that the central bank may not hit pause on its hawkish policies anytime soon, let alone pivot to cutting rates later this year.

Adding to the downbeat mood, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said inflation remains too high and noted that she was open to raising rates by more than what her colleagues wanted at the last monetary policy meeting.

2023-02-17 00:00:00+00:00,AI Stocks: The ACTUAL Winners and Losers from the AI Revolution,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ai-stocks%3A-the-actual-winners-and-losers-from-the-ai-revolution,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
In January, media firm Buzzfeed (NASDAQ:BZFD) made headlines after its CEO proposed using ChatGPT to help generate “cultural currency” and “inspired prompts” for his site. The following week, meme stock Helbiz (NASDAQ:HLBZ) would join the frenzy… without any detail on how an e-scooter business benefits from using chatbots.
Tongues would quickly start wagging.
“The AI stock mania is reminiscent of other speculative crazes in the world of tech,” wrote CNN’s Paul La Monica. “Remember when crypto-related stocks soared in 2021 and then tanked in 2022? And let’s not forget the epic rise of many dot-com companies in the late 1990s and their subsequent plunge in 2000.”
Yet, we know that artificial intelligence is here to stay; Mr. La Monica himself later conceded that AI “is no passing fad.” Much like the internet in the late-90s, we know that artificial intelligence creates tangible benefits… even if we’re not sure how to best use it yet.
That hasn’t stopped investors from unthinkingly rushing in. Shares of Buzzfeed would rise over 100% in the week after its ChatGPT announcement. And Helbiz would spike 250% for a brief period.
That means it’s more important than ever to separate the companies that claim they will benefit from AI, versus the ones that actually do. The internet of the 1990s couldn’t save outdated businesses from the dustbin of history. And artificial intelligence won’t either.
Chipmakers: Many Winners in the High-Tech World
The most obvious winners of the AI revolution are the chipmakers themselves. No matter which software firm eventually prevails, the top hardware makers must still play a role.
Winners: AI and Analog Chipmakers
The greatest beneficiaries of artificial intelligence are chipmakers that create GPUs (graphical processing units) and ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that help train AI models. Most hyped-up alternatives such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Data Processing Units (DPUs) are usually some combination of these two.
These types of chips can run multiple processes at once, making them far more powerful than traditional CPUs at training AI algorithms. GPUs are also becoming more scalable, thanks to a new generation of multi-node software.
As far as the GPU makers themselves, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the leader in the industry. The California-based firm holds a stunning 88% market share thanks to a massive R&D budget that can outspend all competitors. It’s a virtuous cycle that allows Nvidia to develop better hardware and more reliable drivers, which in turn sells more products. Analysts expect the GPU maker’s long-term growth rate to top 21%, according to Thomson Reuters.
However, buying top-dog Nvidia won’t come cheap. The company trades at 65X forward earnings, making it one of the most expensive hardware manufacturers in the world by that metric. Investors know that NVDA is the king, so much of the alpha has already been consumed.
Fortunately, investors have alternatives. First, the FPGA chip industry (field-programmable gate arrays) is a relatively profitable one that also benefits from AI. These are the low-power chips used to run AI models after they’re trained. Here, firms like Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) and Xilinx, a subsidiary of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), are profitable players that can be bought for lower prices than Nvidia. Lattice trades at 46X forward earnings, while AMD trades at 27X.
Next, investors looking further ahead should also consider analog chipmakers. These firms produce chips that are used in sensors and other IOT (internet of things) devices that connect computers with the outside world. Greater use of AI will naturally increase demand for these chips as applications from self-driving cars to smart homes become commonplace. The analog chip industry is also less competitive (and quite profitable) thanks to years of consolidation. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) averages a 31% return on capital invested (ROIC), yet trades for only 21X forward earnings. Smaller competitor Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) has averaged a 20% ROIC and trades at 18X.
Finally, specialized pick-and-shovel companies such as ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) also stand to gain. ASML, for instance, produces the machines that make AI chips, and can be bought at 33X forward earnings.
Losers: General-Purpose and Commodity Chipmakers
Meanwhile, general-purpose CPU companies will see a demand crunch, at least in relative terms. CPUs have more limited applications in artificial intelligence applications, and the industry’s cyclical nature makes it prone to post-overexpansion hangovers. Analysts estimate that Intel’s revenues will shrink almost 20% this year, and for 2026 profits to be less than half of 2019 levels.
Many commodity chipmakers are in even worse shape. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), a firm that produces commoditized memory chips, has seen analysts cut long-term growth rates to -35.4%, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Though artificial intelligence promises to use more computing power, makers of lower-value chips will mostly see no benefit.
Software Companies: Mostly Good… If You’re High-Tech
It’s still too early to call winners with “generative” AI models. Chatbots — from OpenAI’s ChatGPT to Alphabet’s LaMDA — are relatively neck-and-neck in their problem-solving abilities. And the industry currently has surprisingly low barriers to entry; the internet is a trove of free training data, and talented engineers are quick to switch jobs. It’s a fool’s errand to guess whether Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) or Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AI will come out ahead.
Nevertheless, winners are already emerging in other industries.
Winners: Data Analytics
The clearest corporate beneficiaries of AI are those that help users analyze, crunch and store data. Many of these companies — such as Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) — have used existing products to establish a base, and then upsold customers on “value-added” AI products. Workday, for instance, has been able to help employers predict which workers are about to quit… since 2019. And Salesforce’s Einstein now provides salespeople with recommendations for the next best actions when making a sale. Rapid improvements in artificial intelligence will create even more “land and expand” abilities.
Other firms are more direct. Companies like cloud monitoring firm DataDog (NASDAQ:DDOG) and cybersecurity firm Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) rely on machine learning to provide any product at all. Without it, their monitoring and authentication services will look much like the legacy systems they’re attempting to replace. And as artificial intelligence improves, products at these next-gen companies will stand out even more relative to legacy products. DataDog and Okta are expected to grow revenues by 32% and 41%, respectively, this year.
Losers: Business Process Outsourcing Firms
On the other hand, AI is squeezing lower-value software companies. And in particular, business process outsourcing (BPO) firms are feeling the heat. Former meme stock Exela Technologies (NASDAQ:XELA) now trades at a near-zero valuation. And Xerox’s BPO spinoff Conduent (NASDAQ:CNDT) has lost over 70% of its market value since spinning off in 2016. These companies specialize in offloading manual tasks to offshore workers, and AI tools are replacing everything from customer service chats to manual data entry.
Perhaps the only notable exception is Accenture (NYSE:ACN) — a consulting firm that’s long focused on higher-value BPO solutions. But even there, growth is slowing. Analysts expect Accenture’s earnings per share (EPS) growth to decline from the 16% range to single-digits this year.
Digital Media: A Mixed Bag
Winners: You and Me
In 2021, intense competition between Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other streaming services sparked “peak TV,” a period of incredible content creation. The number of original, scripted, adult-targeted programs jumped to 559, according to FX Research — straining the wallets of companies from Amazon to Disney (NYSE:DIS)
A similar gold rush is now happening in generative AI, particularly in digital art and chatbots. High-quality image generators from Midjourney to Stable Diffusion are available to anyone with an internet connection (and enough patience to wait in line). And Microsoft’s $10 billion investment in OpenAI and its ChatGPT is still (mostly) being given away for free to the public. (Google’s Bard might have to be given away, considering its issues).
The bonanza will last longer than most realize. The cost of running an AI model costs far less than… say… producing a hit TV show. And the competitive cloud industry means that cloud computing firms themselves are the ones using AI chatbots as loss leaders. Online storage might be a commodity. A high-quality chatbot running on it is not.
Losers: Content Creation Sites… And Many NFT Holders
Sadly, advancements in AI won’t help content creation companies — a competitive industry that has already exhausted the benefits of outsourcing. Websites like Forbes already routinely use freelancers in place of full-time staff. Only 10% of Buzzfeed’s staff belong to the NewsGuild labor union.
The inclusion of AI will only worsen the “race to the bottom” in digital media. Buzzfeed holds no monopoly over ChatGPT usage, so any financial benefit from using the service will be quickly erased by competitors doing the same. Only “AI-content natives” might benefit.
It’s the same story we saw in apparel in the 2000s with the rise of e-commerce: No clothing brand received an outright advantage, save for online-only companies.
Then there are NFT holders — investors who splashed out in 2021-2022 to acquire the rights to expensive digital art. Today, AI can create digital pieces by the thousands… and automatically mint them as NFTs if asked. It’s a comeuppance for those who once noted that “lots of NFTs are fairly dumb.”
Many younger investors might wonder what it was like to invest during the late-1990s tech bubble. With the introduction of AI chatbots and other generative models, these investors don’t have to dream any longer.

Next, investors looking further ahead should also consider analog chipmakers.",2023,2023-02-17,21.369007110595703,0.65,0.35,0.1,0.2,0.0

BRUSSELS, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft MSFT.O President Brad Smith on Tuesday will seek to convince EU antitrust regulators at a closed hearing that the U.S. software giant's $69 billion bid for ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard ATVI.O will boost competition.
Smith will lead a delegation of 18 senior executives, including Microsoft Gaming Chief Executive Officer Phil Spencer, while Activision will be represented by its CEO Robert Kotick, a European Commission document seen by Reuters showed.
The hearing will allow Xbox maker Microsoft to gauge the mood among senior EU and national competition officials and European Commission lawyers ahead of the submission of remedies to address antitrust concerns.
""I think we will make clear that our acquisition of Activision Blizzard will bring more games to more people on more devices and platforms than ever before,"" Smith told reporters on his way to the hearing.
Microsoft was willing to address concerns with ""Call of Duty"" licensing offers similar to the 10-year deal with Nintendo 7974.T and regulatory undertakings, Smith added, without providing any further details.
Microsoft announced the Activision acquisition in January last year to take on leaders Tencent 0700.HK and Sony 6758.T, but has run into regulatory headwinds in Europe, Britain and the United States.
Sony, which wants the deal to be blocked, sent its gaming chief Jim Ryan.
Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google and chip designer and computing firm Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, which has a gaming business, also took part in the hearing.
""The European Commission asked for our views in the course of their inquiries into this issue. We will continue to cooperate in any processes, when requested, to ensure all views are considered,"" a Google spokesperson said.
Nvidia declined to comment. The European Games Developer Federation, which has said the deal will allow Microsoft to challenge Apple AAPL.O, Google and Tencent, is one of the participants.
Video game distributor Valve, video game publisher Electronic Arts EA.O and the German competition watchdog and its peers in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden will also be taking part in the event.

 The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Visa Inc. (V), and Toyota Motor Corporation (TM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
 You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>
  Shares of NVIDIA have declined -2.0% over the past year against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry’s decline of -10.5%. The Zacks analyst believes that the company’s near-term prospect looks gloomy due to weakening demand for its chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While the macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and data center chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war is likely to continue negatively impact NVIDIA’s near-term revenues.
 Nonetheless, solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions is likely to aid NVIDIA’s growth. Additionally, collaboration with the likes of Mercedes-Benz and Audi is expected to further strengthen NVIDIA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.

 Shares of Visa have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+0.9% vs. -6.4%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company’s numerous buyouts and alliances paved the way for long-term growth and consistently drove its revenues. Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa.
 A strong cash position enables it to boost shareholder value. However, high operating expenses stress the margins. Ramped-up client incentives will dent the top line. The company's volumes will likely suffer due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
  (You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)
 Shares of Toyota Motor have declined -25.0% over the past year against the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry’s decline of -34.8%. The Zacks analyst believes that the shortage of microchips compounded by the Russia-Ukraine war is weighing on Toyota. The Japanese auto giant is also bearing the brunt of soaring raw material prices. Supply-chain disruptions, logistical challenges, and manufacturing inefficiencies are playing spoilsports.
 Additionally, high inflation, rising interest rates, and an uncertain macro environment also raise concern for Toyota as the auto industry is highly cyclic. Rising R&D expenses and capex are expected to hurt near-term margins and cash flows. The company’s high debt levels also raise concerns.

2023-03-02 00:00:00+00:00,Why Qualcomm Stock Lagged the Market on Thursday,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-qualcomm-stock-lagged-the-market-on-thursday,"What happened
Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) stock couldn't quite keep pace with the broader market on Thursday, ending the day essentially flat while the S&P 500 index crept almost 0.8% higher. Some investors were dismayed by a new take on semiconductor companies from an analyst resuming coverage of the sector who was rather cool on Qualcomm's prospects.
So what
The (re)covering party was Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri, who resumed tracking a host of ""semis."" In addition to Qualcomm, the lineup included top sector players Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others.
Of the nine stocks, Pajjuri tagged two -- Nvidia and AMD -- as strong buys, rated four (including Intel) as outperform (buy, in other words), and three as mere market-perform (i.e., hold) candidates. Qualcomm was one of the latter trio.
Pajjuri's reasoning with regard to Qualcomm was that it should be able to ride the wave of a cyclical recovery in the semiconductor industry, but its tailwinds are dying down.
Now what
This latest take on Qualcomm came less than a month after the company released its first-quarter fiscal 2023 results.
Battered by challenging macroeconomic conditions, its revenue and profits both fell by double-digit percentages in the quarter -- revenue declined by 12% on a year-over-year basis, while non-GAAP (adjusted) net income tumbled by nearly 30%. Crucially, its biggest hardware segment (mobile handsets) saw an 18% drop in sales.
Analysts like Pajjuri are forecasting more pain for Qualcomm, though. Their collective revenue and net income estimates for both the current quarter and fiscal 2023 are down compared to their previous respective periods.

2023-03-03 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-Nvidia's plans for sales to Huawei imperiled if U.S. tightens Huawei curbs-draft,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-nvidias-plans-for-sales-to-huawei-imperiled-if-u.s.-tightens-huawei-curbs-draft,"By Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp's plans to sell technology to China's Huawei would be thwarted if the U.S. government proceeds with a proposal to further restrict shipments to the blacklisted company, a draft report by a government contractor shows.
The Biden administration has been considering limiting the items it authorizes U.S. companies to ship to telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co, which was added to a U.S. trade blacklist in 2019 but which continues to receive billions in U.S. goods under a special plan implemented by the Trump administration.
""The proposed 2023 amendment of (the Commerce Department's) licensing will likely have a high economic impact on Nvidia,"" according to excerpts of the draft report seen by Reuters, referring to the company's ""pending license value.""
Nvidia's plans to sell to Huawei have not been previously reported.
A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the document, saying: ""The China market presents a significant opportunity for the U.S. semiconductor industry. While we are unable to comment on any pending license requests, we work with customers and partners worldwide to comply with all applicable export controls and meet market demand.”
A senior State Department Official said the document was a preliminary draft prepared by a contractor, and the department ""would not have approved of the report in its current form."" It also said the government ""has written and contracted multiple reports on this subject, based on different contingencies, which arrive at very different conclusions.""
The White House and Commerce Department declined to comment. Huawei did not respond to a request for comment.
The document shows the Biden administration is seeking to assess the impact on U.S. companies of proposed Huawei policy changes before imposing new rules that could crimp projected revenue streams at a time when the tech industry is already reeling. It also provides unusual insight into the politically sensitive question of which U.S. companies are seeking business ties to Huawei, one of Washington's most penalized Chinese companies.
Reuters could not learn the details of the specific policy change whose impact was being assessed in the report.
The report suggested Qualcomm would likely suffer a ""moderate economic impact"" from the change in policy, in contrast to Huawei. Indeed, the loss of access to Qualcomm's modem chips would have a bigger impact on Huawei, the report forecast, since Huawei ""relies heavily on Qualcomm's modem chips to support its smart phone offering.""
Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment.
Reuters reported in 2021 that U.S. officials had approved license applications worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Huawei to buy chips for its growing auto component business, including vehicle components such as video screens and sensors, as trade restrictions crippled other business lines.
Huawei was placed on the ""entity list"" in 2019 amid fears it could spy on Americans and allegations it was stealing intellectual property and violating sanctions. The U.S requires that suppliers seek a special license that is usually denied when selling U.S. goods to companies on the list. But the Trump administration instituted a more lenient policy for Huawei, blocking its access to 5G chips but allowing other items like 4G chips to be shipped to the firm.
The Commerce Department's top export controls official, Alan Estevez, said this week the Trump-era policy allowing U.S. technology below the “5G level"" to be shipped to Huawei was ""under assessment.""
But sources say there are differences within the administration odds over how far to go: some officials advocate blocking all licenses to Huawei suppliers and revoking existing authorizations, while others want to extend restrictions only to 4G chips and other targeted technologies going forward.

2023-03-06 00:00:00+00:00,"SoftBank's Arm aims to raise at least $8 billion in U.S. IPO, sources say",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/softbanks-arm-aims-to-raise-at-least-%248-billion-in-u.s.-ipo-sources-say-1,"By Echo Wang and Anirban Sen
NEW YORK, March 5 (Reuters) - Arm Ltd, the British chip designer owned by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T, is likely to aim to raise at least $8 billion from what is expected to be a blockbuster U.S. stock market launch this year, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
Arm is expected to confidentially submit paperwork for its initial public offering in late April, the two sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential. The listing is expected to happen later this year and the exact timing will be determined by market conditions, the sources added.
SoftBank has picked four investment banks to lead what is expected to be the most high-profile stock market flotation in recent years. Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Barclays BARC.L and Mizuho Financial Group 8411.T are expected to be the lead underwriters for the deal, the sources said, adding that no bank has been picked for the much-coveted ""lead left"" position yet.
The Australian Financial Review reported on the lead banks earlier on Sunday.
The preparations for the IPO are expected to be kick-started in the U.S. in the coming days, the sources said. The valuation range has not yet been finalized but Cambridge, England-based Arm is hoping to be valued at more than $50 billion during its share sale, the sources said.
SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Arm, Goldman Sachs, Mizuho, Barclays, and JPMorgan declined to comment.
A successful listing for Arm this year would provide a boost to the IPO market, which has been largely frozen since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 triggered market volatility and a huge sell-off in tech stocks.
The IPO market briefly flickered back to life last month as a number of companies including solar tech firm Nextracker Inc NXT.O and Chinese sensor maker Hesai Group HSAI.O listed their shares on U.S. stock exchanges, but investors still remain wary of betting on new stocks.
IPO advisors are not expecting a full-blown recovery in capital markets until the latter half of this year.
Arm said last week it would pursue a U.S.-only listing this year, dashing the British government's hopes that the tech giant would return to the London stock market.
SoftBank has been pursuing a listing for Arm since its deal to sell the chip designer to Nvidia Corp NVDA.O for $40 billion collapsed last year because of objections from U.S. and European antitrust regulators.

2023-03-08 00:00:00+00:00,Will Tech Sector Earnings Growth Resume in Q1?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-tech-sector-earnings-growth-resume-in-q1,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>
Here are the key points:
 Total S&P 500 earnings for 2023 Q1 are expected to be down -9% from the same period last year on +1.9% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.8% decline in the preceding period’s earnings (2022 Q4) on +5.5% higher revenues.
  Estimates have come down the most for the Aerospace, Basic Materials, Autos, Consumer Discretionary, Retail, Medical and Transportation sectors. The Utilities sector is the only one that has enjoyed modest positive revisions since the start of January.
 While the direction of 2023 Q1 earnings estimates is in-line with the trend we have been seeing over the few quarters, the magnitude of negative revisions is smaller relative to what we had seen in the comparable periods for the preceding two quarters.
 Earnings estimates for full-year 2023 have been coming down as well. From their peak in mid-April 2022, the aggregate total for the year has been cut by -12.4% for the index as a whole and -14.5% excluding the Energy sector’s contribution.
 The Tech sector has gotten off to a great start in 2023, handily outperforming the S&P 500 index in the year-to-date period. While Tech stocks have lost ground over the last few weeks, the Zacks Tech sector is still up +12.1% in the year-to-date period vs. the +3.9% gain for the market as a whole. 
This came after a tough year for the group in 2022 when Tech stocks were big-time losers. The Zacks Tech sector lost -36.2% of its value in calendar year 2022, clearly underperforming the S&P 500 index’s -20.7% decline.
These stocks’ recent positive follow through has a lot to do with the market’s evolving expectations of an end to the Fed’s tightening cycle. Higher interest rates resulting from the hawkish Fed posture are a big headwind for these ‘long-duration’ stocks, a big portion of whose value comes from profitabiltiy in future years.
The onset of monetary policy headwinds last year coincided with the group adjusting to the post-Covid world. As we all know, Tech companies were big beneficiaries of Covid-related disruptions. You can see this in the chart below that shows the Zacks Tech sector’s total earnings, actual as well as estimated, in billion dollars.

The chart below shows the same data as growth rates

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The post-Covid adjustment view posits that the 2021 jump in the group’s earnings brought forward profitability from future years. As you can see in the above two charts, the market expects this ‘adjustment’ to last through this year, with ‘regular’ growth resuming next year.
The Tech sector’s earnings outlook has been weighed down by the combined effects of post-Covid adjustment and softening demand as a result of the Fed tightening. The chart below shows how the Tech sector’s 2023 earnings estimates have evolved since the start of last year

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
As noted earlier, aggregate 2023 earnings estimates for the group have been cut more than -20% since April last year. The magnitude of cuts to some of the major players in the space such Alphabet GOOGL, Meta META, Nvidia NVDA and others is even more pronounced.
The Earnings Big Picture
For the current period (2023 Q1), S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to decline -9% from the same period last year on +1.9% higher revenues.
As has been the case over the few quarters, estimates for 2023 Q1 have been steadily coming down, as the chart below shows

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Please note that the magnitude of cuts to Q1 estimates is relatively lower compared to what we saw in the comparable periods for the last few quarters.
The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate earnings estimates for 2023 since the start of 2022.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
As noted earlier, the current aggregate earnings total for the index approximates to an index ‘EPS’ of $215.23, down from $242.98 in mid-April, 2022.
The chart below tracks these index ‘EPS’ values since the start of 2022. Please note that these ‘EPS’ values are imputed approximations and have been previously published on the dates listed in the chart below.

Expectations for the Coming Periods
The chart below provides a big-picture view of earnings on a quarterly basis. The growth rate for Q4 is on a blended basis, where the actual reports that have come out are combined with estimates for the still-to-come companies.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
As mentioned earlier, 2023 aggregate earnings estimates on an ex-Energy basis are already down by more than -14% since mid-April 2022. Perhaps we see a bit more downward adjustments to estimates over the coming weeks, after more companies report Q4 results and provide guidance along the lines of what we saw with Microsoft. But we have nevertheless already covered some ground in taking estimates to a fair or appropriate level.
This is particularly so if whatever economic downturn lies ahead proves to be more of the garden variety rather than the last two such events. Recency bias forces us to use the last two economic downturns, which were also among the nastiest in recent history, as our reference points. But we need to be cautious against that natural tendency as the economy’s foundations at present remain unusually strong.
This Little-Known Semiconductor Stock Could Be Your Portfolio’s Hedge Against Inflation
Everyone uses semiconductors. But only a small number of people know what they are and what they do. If you use a smartphone, computer, microwave, digital camera or refrigerator (and that’s just the tip of the iceberg), you have a need for semiconductors. That’s why their importance can’t be overstated and their disruption in the supply chain has such a global effect. But every cloud has a silver lining. Shockwaves to the international supply chain from the global pandemic have unearthed a tremendous opportunity for investors. And today, Zacks' leading stock strategist is revealing the one semiconductor stock that stands to gain the most in a new FREE report. It's yours at no cost and with no obligation.

Top Analyst Reports for NVIDIA, McDonald's and Intuit
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp., McDonald's Corp. and Intuit Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

You can see all of today's research reports here >>>

Shares of NVIDIA have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+6.0% vs. -4.6%). The company is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.

Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. The Zacks analyst expects its Automotive segment's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 50% through fiscal 2023-2025.

However, NVDA's near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and data center chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.

McDonald's shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (+15.3% vs. +12.9%). Sales at company-operated restaurants grew 7% year over year. The growth was fueled by strategic menu prices, strong operating performance, marketing campaigns and loyalty programs.

McDonald's increased focus on menu innovation is commendable. The company is also undertaking every effort to drive growth in international markets. Robust digitalization is likely to help the company to drive long-term growth.

However, the inflationary pressure and persisting COVID-related risks are concerns.

Shares of Intuit have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-7.9% vs. -7.5%). The company is facing macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds which might significantly hurt small businesses operations, thereby posing risks for Intuit's top-line growth. Additionally, higher costs and expenses due to increased investments in marketing and engineering teams are likely to continue impacting bottom-line results in the near term.

However, Intuit is benefiting from strong momentum in online ecosystem revenues and solid professional tax revenues. The TurboTax Live offering is also driving growth in the Consumer tax business. Solid momentum in the company's lending product, QuickBooks Capital, remains a positive.

Moreover, the company's strategy of shifting its business to cloud-based subscription model will help generate stable revenues over the long run.

2023-03-14 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Metaverse Stocks Ready for a Bull Run,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-metaverse-stocks-ready-for-a-bull-run-0,"Investing in the metaverse is a rather nebulous concept. There's no official definition for what the metaverse is, other than a variety of virtual worlds where people can interact.
During the pandemic, the value of such virtual spaces became clear. The market rewarded companies that shifted their focus to developing next-generation virtual experiences. That's not so much the case now. In fact, the market has punished some companies because of their ties to the metaverse.
However, I think there's a long-term investing thesis that can hold water for specific companies operating in this space. Here are three of my top picks for investors looking for metaverse stocks to buy during the next bull run.
1. Meta Platforms
Investors are finally regaining confidence in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) stock. Indeed, 2022 was not a great year for investors in the company formerly known as Facebook. That's mainly due to bearish sentiment around the company's financial performance, as investors homed in on the company's incredible spending clip when it comes to the metaverse.
Meta's Reality Labs division burned more than $1 billion per month in 2022, losing $13.7 billion in 2022 alone. However, a slightly lower-than-expected operating loss of $4.3 billion last quarter, relative to expectations of a $4.4 billion loss, along with significant cost-cutting efforts, did lead the stock to surge following the company's earnings report.
With the stock still hovering around levels seen following the report, it appears the market is still trying to digest Meta's longer-term outlook.
On the cost front, where many investors are most concerned, Meta has signaled a more intense focus. The company announced a second round of layoffs this week, in a bid to assure investors that bottom-line performance will continue to be the focus, as Meta's so-called ""year of efficiency"" continues. The company has also reportedly moved to a flatter corporate model, asking many of its managers to ""get back to making things or leave.""
Free cash flow numbers will continue to be my primary focus with this stock. These cost-cutting efforts should accelerate growth on this front, which has been lagging. Meta's 2022 cash flow of $5.3 billion was decent compared with the $1.5 billion analysts expected, but it still declined nearly 60% from 2021 levels.
Given the relatively low bar Meta now has to jump over, should free cash flow growth accelerate in 2023 and 2024, this is a stock with plenty of room to appreciate in the years to come.
2. Nvidia
As the leader in the GPU market, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) plays a pivotal role in the metaverse industry. Its years of experience and state-of-the-art design abilities make it a dependable platform for developers to use as they construct new products, experiences, and services in the metaverse.
Nvidia's stock price has been on a tear thus far in 2023, surging in an almost linear fashion to start the year. This move probably represents a broader bullish take on Nvidia's growth prospects over the longer term, particularly in high-profile areas such as artificial intelligence (AI).
That said, this is a highly diversified company with respect to the markets Nvidia serves. The company's high-end GPUs are foundational for a number of high-growth industries. AI is just one of many use cases for its technology.
The company's previous significant declines in 2022 were generally tied to expectations of slowing growth in areas such as gaming, which implicitly includes the metaverse, and crypto mining. However, if investors turn bullish on high-tech growth stocks once again, it could be argued that any sort of bull run in the metaverse would be a similar catalyst as the recent surge in the valuation of AI-related companies this year.
Nvidia stock is one I view as a more indirect way to play a potential bull market rally among metaverse stocks. For investors seeking growth exposure, Nvidia's more diversified business model, and the fact the company serves so many unique industries with their own sets of secular tailwinds, could provide relative outperformance over the long run, even compared with the other two names on this list.
3. Roblox
Roblox (NYSE: RBLX) runs a metaverse gaming platform that allows users to construct and participate in games simultaneously. During the pandemic, the platform saw a surge in popularity as people sought improved social connections, which Roblox's virtual worlds provided through its metaverse environment. However, the growth rate has since stabilized, leading to a substantial decrease in the stock price of RBLX.
The company's focus has been expanding its target audience. During Roblox's Q3earnings call CEO David Baszucki noted, ""It's worth mentioning that the growth in the 17- [to] 24-year-old demographic has consistently improved over the past three to four years, and this is due to our all-encompassing approach.""
I think the company's recent stock price decline was probably warranted. Hindsight is a great thing, of course. However, the idea that Roblox's revenue could continue to grow at a nearly fourfold clip, as it did between Q4 2019 and Q4 2021, was wishful thinking. At these more reasonable valuations, any sort of surprise to the upside in terms of growth could reinvigorate the growth-investor crowd.
The metaverse is down, but not out
These metaverse stocks are probably poised for more volatility in 2023. It's hard to make the case that growth will materialize to the extent many investors had previously priced in during the most recent bull run. These stocks sold off as the market sought more appropriate valuation levels across the board.
However, should growth accelerate as these companies continue to invest in their innovative and disruptive technologies, it's entirely possible that these three metaverse stocks could be outperformers during the next bull market rally.

It’s not all bad out there. While bank failures and ongoing market volatility generate headlines, there are several stocks that have staged huge rallies to start the year. Many technology stocks that were badly beaten up in 2022 have gained more than 50% since the start of this year. While worries persist about inflation and the likelihood that interest rates will continue rising over the near-term, investors have been quietly piling into certain securities, leading to isolated breakouts that could result in some share prices skyrocketing in the coming weeks and months. To be sure, risks remain. But investors who know where to look can make money in the market right now. Here are three breakout stocks to buy before they skyrocket.
NVDA Nvidia $258
META Meta $199
AMZN Amazon $98.55
Nvidia (NVDA)

So far in 2023, the share price of semiconductor and microchip company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has gained 77%. Considering that we’re only ten weeks into the year, that is an astounding gain in a relatively short period of time. Looking behind us, it appears that NVDA stock bottomed at $108 a share last October. Since then, the share price has more than doubled. And momentum seems to be gathering behind the chipmaker as its stock has gained 10% in the last month alone.
The breakout appears to have been fueled by several factors. Sentiment towards technology stocks has been improving after a brutal selloff through much of last year. Nvidia gave investors and analysts reasons for optimism with a fourth-quarter earnings print, delivered at the end of February, that beat expectations.
And Nvidia’s high-powered chips are seen as a key component needed to advance artificial intelligence and the chatbots that are transfixing the investment community. All this signals that NVDA stock is likely to continue rising.
Meta Platforms (META)

Facebook’s parent company, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), is another tech stock that is breaking out after a tough downturn in 2022. In 2023, META stock has risen 58%, including a 14% gain over the past month. The share price is on the cusp of breaking above $200 and a new 52-week high looks within reach. Sentiment towards the company run by Mark Zuckerberg has improved dramatically from just a few months ago when analysts were disparaging the billions of dollars being allocated to the development of the metaverse.
Zuckerberg and his company have managed to win back analysts and investors by undertaking aggressive cost-cutting measures that have included laying off more than 20,000 employees. Zuckerberg has called 2023 Meta’s “year of efficiency,” which is winning applause along Wall Street.
On February 1, Meta Platforms also announced a $40 billion stock buyback program, which has also helped lift the share price. And, META stock is benefitting from threats by President Joe Biden to ban Chinese social media app TikTok, which is a key competitor of Meta Platforms.
Amazon (AMZN)

Many professional analysts and traders on Wall Street are rooting for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently named Amazon a “top pick” for the remainder of 2023. And JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) just reaffirmed its “overweight” (buy) rating on AMZN stock.
These firms believe that Amazon’s stock has been oversold and that its CEO, Andy Jassy, is righting the ship after announcing 18,000 job cuts and hitting pause on several infrastructure projects, including a second headquarters in Virginia.
While AMZN stock has not rallied as strongly as NVDA or META  this year, there are signs of life at the e-commerce company. Amazon’s share price has risen 7% since the beginning of March and is now close to breaking above $100 a share for the first time since the start of February.
Amazon has also benefitted from a rotation out of bank stocks following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, and growing expectations that the Federal Reserve may now need to slow its pace of interest-rate increases.

NVIDIA Declares $0.04 Dividend
On February 22, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share ($0.16 annualized). Shareholders of record as of March 8, 2023 will receive the payment on March 29, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.04 per share.
At the current share price of $255.41 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.06%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.20%, the lowest has been 0.02%, and the highest has been 0.50%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.12 (n=237).
The current dividend yield is 1.09 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.09. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

  Welcome to Episode #353 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.
Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.
This week, Tracey is going solo to discuss the semiconductor stocks. After a terrible 2022, the semiconductors stocks have rallied in 2023. The iShares Semiconductor ETF is up 23% year-to-date while the S&P 500 has only gained 3.6%.
Are the Semis Sending a Bullish Signal?
On Mar 20, 2023, Carson Group’s Chief Market Strategist, Ryan Detrick, tweeted out about how the semis made a “new 52-week relative strength high” versus the S&P 500. Detrick noted in the tweet that such an event wasn’t normally consistent with a recession.
Is the semiconductor rally of 2023 signaling that there will NOT be a recession this year? Is the economy stronger than many realize?
And if not, should investors be buying the semiconductors?
5 Big Cap Semiconductor Stocks
1.      NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)
NVIDIA is the semiconductor company on everyone’s lips in 2023 due to its focus on gaming and AI. After selling off in 2022, shares of NVIDIA have rallied 76% year-to-date.
Earnings are expected to jump 34.1% in fiscal 2024 and another 33% in fiscal 2025.
But investors won’t get NVIDIA shares cheaply on a P/E basis. It trades with a forward P/E of 57.8.
Should investors disregard valuation and own NVIDIA for its growth anyway?
2.      Broadcom (AVGO)
Broadcom is also up in 2023, gaining 13.8% year-to-date. Analysts are bullish on Broadcom, with 12 estimates up for fiscal 2023 in the last month. Earnings are expected to rise 9.9% this year.
Shares of Broadcom are also still cheap, with a forward P/E of just 15.6. Additionally, many income investors are fans, as Broadcom pays a dividend currently yielding 2.9%.
Should Broadcom be on your short list due to its attractive valuation?
3.      Texas Instruments (TXN)
Texas Instruments is the third largest position in the iShares Semiconductor ETF. Shares of Texas Instruments are also up in 2023, gaining 7.2%.
But earnings are expected to fall 19.8% this year to $7.53 from $9.39 last year. It’s not that cheap, with a forward P/E of 23.8.
Is Texas Instruments a value trap?
4.      Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)
Advanced Micro Devices has soared 46.5% in 2023. But it’s a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) as 14 earnings estimates have been cut in the last 2 months for 2023, including one in the last week.
Earnings are expected to fall 14% in 2023 to $3.01 from $3.50. Advanced Micro Devices is also not a cheap stock, with a forward P/E of 32.2.
Is Wall Street looking past Advance Micro Device’s falling earnings estimates for this year?
5.      QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM)
QUALCOMM shares are also up in 2023, gaining 11.8% year-to-date. But analysts are bearish on it, as earnings are expected to fall 24.1% in fiscal 2023. The Zacks Consensus is calling for $9.51 from the $12.53 it made last year.
QUALCOMM, however, is still cheap. It has a forward P/E of just 12.8. QUALCOMM also pays a dividend, currently yielding 2.5%.
Should investors be keeping QUALCOMM on its short list?

2023-03-23 00:00:00+00:00,US STOCKS-Wall St ends higher as Yellen vows actions to safeguard deposits,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-st-ends-higher-as-yellen-vows-actions-to-safeguard-deposits,"By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - Wall Street see-sawed to a higher close on Thursday as market participants were reassured by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's reassurances that measures will be taken to keep Americans' deposits safe.
""You watch this market and you watch it change direction in a short period of time and it’s based on some market participants’ interpretation over what someone said and how it affects how their trading,"" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta.
""The market as a whole is telling you is there are a lot of different ways to interpret all the things people are saying.""
The session followed Wednesday's boom-and-bust moves after the Fed's rate hike, Fed Chair Jerome Powell's subsequent Q&A session and Yellen's testimony before Congress in which she ruled out blanket protection for all deposits.
Interest rate hikes by central banks around the world have stressed the banking sector, which became manifest with the recent failures of SVB Financial Group SIVB.O and Signature Bank SBNY.O.
Jitters among regional banks persist.
""Every central bank that was on path to raise rates raised them,"" GLOBALT's Martin added. ""Therefore they’ve all identified that inflation is currently the most important issue and poses the most risk to the system, whereas the effect of higher rates on financial stability isn’t as much of a concern - although it remains highly concerning.""
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 11.12 points, or 0.28%, to end at 3,948.09 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC gained 116.85 points, or 1.00%, to 11,786.81. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 66.08 points, or 0.21%, to 32,096.19.
Shares of First Republic Bank FRC.Ndropped in volatile trading in the wake of Yellen's testimony.
Chipmaker Nvidia Corp NVDA.O advanced after Needham raised its price target.
Block Inc SQ.N shares slid after Hindenburg Research disclosed its short positions in the company.
Crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc COIN.O tanked in the wake of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's threat to sue the company.
Accenture ACN.N surged after it announced plans to cut about 2.5% of its workforce.

Stronger solar module shipments helped Canadian Solar (CSIQ) topple expectations, and Accenture (ACN) trimmed its annual revenue guidance and announced a big round of layoffs.
Amazon.com Announces More Job Cuts
Accenture wasn't the only tech name that announced layoffs, as Amazon.com (AMZN) announced it will cut 9,000 jobs in two of its highly-successful division. Ford Motor (F) revealed financial details in its electric vehicle (EV) unit, including a $2.1 billion loss.  Nvidia (NVDA) was praised by analysts after revealing its artificial intelligence (AI) tool. The embattled bank sector saw some positive updates, with New York Community Bancorp (NYBC) agreed to buy deposits and loans from Signature Bank (SBNY), and PacWest Bancorp (PACW) announced its deposits movements stabilized.

2023-03-27 00:00:00+00:00,Price & Volume: The Anatomy of a True Market Leader,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/price-volume%3A-the-anatomy-of-a-true-market-leader,"Price & Volume are Key Elements
Studies show that as much as 60% of the human body is comprised of hydrogen and oxygen (water). Said another way, without water, humans cannot survive very long. In the stock market, the elements that comprise a true market leader are strong price and volume trends. Without these two critical ingredients, a stock is unlikely to trend higher.
Monitoring price and volume (or supply and demand) is vital for an investor because it can provide valuable insights into the behavior of the general market and individual equities, such as clues of:
·      Institutional Accumulation: When a stock shoots higher on expanding price and volume, it can be a clue that an institution is accumulating a position. For example, after its last earnings report, Nvidia (NVDA) gapped higher by 14% on volume 129% above the norm.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Nvidia traded a mind-blowing 111 million shares in the session. Because such a large number of shares is impossible for retail investors to buy, the demand was indicative of institutional investors like mutual funds, banks, and pension funds. Remember, institutions move stocks, not retail.
·      A Strong Pullback: As any experienced investor knows, no stock goes straight up. For this reason, investors can gain valuable information by monitoring how a stock pulls back. Shallow pullbacks on low volume are a sign of digestion, not downward conviction. Often, the strength of a stock is revealed in the pullback, not the advance. See Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) below:

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
·      Weak Rallies: When a stock moves higher on low volume, it should raise cautionary flags for investors. Rallies like this signify that while the stock is moving higher, conviction is low. A good recent example is Walker Dunlop (WD).

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Takeaway
Similar to how a doctor consoles an X-Ray for pertinent information, investors look to price and volume charts to reveal important patterns. Charts help investors to identify institutional accumulation from low conviction accumulation. Furthermore, they allow investors to separate strong pullbacks from weak ones. As the old saying goes, “a picture is worth a thousand words.”

There is a lot of buzz today around artificial intelligence, or AI, and how it is taking over our lives. Created through machine learning, it is about training a system with ample data to make inferences about all the new data. AI has been around for a few years but since the start of 2023, it seems like it is everywhere. With the need for advanced technology growing, AI has already become a main driver across industries, from robotics to Big Data and the internet of things. It has started to transform the software development space and is going to be huge this year. However, the market is still in the early stages of AI adoption and smart investors know that AI growth stocks are where the potential lies.
There are many artificial intelligence stocks on the market, but only a few have the potential to make it big. If you want to tap into the future of AI, consider pure-play AI stocks for your portfolio. Growing interest and an investment surge in AI makes it an ideal time to take your position. Let’s take a look at the best AI growth stocks to add to your portfolio:
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com
One of the first companies that comes to mind when we think of the best AI growth stocks is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Already a solid player in the industry, Microsoft was recently in the news for increasing its stake in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. The revolutionary tool has shown how far AI can go and how capable it is in generating images, texts, ideas, and sounds. This year, Microsoft made a $10 billion investment, a sizeable increase from its previous investment of $1 billion in 2019.
Microsoft recently added “AI-generated stories” to its Bing search engine to give users a better insight into AI. MSFT stock is trading at $280, up 18% in the past six months, and is inching closer to the 52-week high of $315, making it one of the best artificial intelligence stocks to own today. AI justifies its higher valuation and I believe the company’s investments will pay off in the near term. 
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sees AI as the next big computing platform and this investment is just step one in the company’s AI transition. Apart from this investment, the company is harnessing the power of AI in multiple ways, including clinical documentation and healthcare. 
This month, Microsoft also introduced Dynamics 365 Copilot, a tool designed to assist with many businesses’ day-to-day tasks including marketing, sales, and customer service. The technology is still being tested but, if successful, could transform the current automated chat experience. Microsoft is a proven performer, no matter the state of the tech industry, making it a stock to buy and hold onto.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Another artificial intelligence stock to watch out for is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). A leader in the graphics chip industry, it is making the most of the AI boom and could become one of the biggest players in the world. Its data center segment has shown a steady rise in the share of the total revenue of the company and managed to top the gaming segment in revenue last year. Despite the drop in tech stocks and the market turmoil, NVDA stock was standing strong because AI was one of the driving forces behind its growth. 
The stock is currently trading at $265 and is up more than 100% in the past six months. Nvidia recently launched a set of inference platforms designed for generative AI and its chips are already popular for handling large workloads. Because it has applications that are required to run AI apps, Nvidia should remain in demand and relevant in the upcoming years.
In the upcoming years, Nvidia intends to make self-driving car processors another revenue stream. Since cars with self-driving capabilities gather ample amounts of data from cameras and sensors in real-time, AI is then used to make complex decisions — something Nvidia intends to start contributing to in the next few years. NVDA stock does not come cheap and it is currently trading at 24.8 times sales, but the growth potential is massive.
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)
Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, is another top artificial intelligence stock to buy for long-term growth. It recently acquired Alter, an AI avatar startup that allows creators and brands to express their virtual identities, for $100 million. In order to get an edge in the AI sector, companies need to make ongoing investments and Alphabet has the liquidity to do so. It also has the experience and resources to make a mark in the AI industry.
The company’s recent history is not without setbacks. Between the partnership of Microsoft with OpenAI and their ChatGPT tool, as well as the relatively unsuccessful launch of Google’s own AI-equipped service, Bard, GOOG stock has taken hits in recent months. However, the company has many years of experience in deep learning and it can help with a smooth transition into AI.
GOOGL stock is on sale currently which is also another reason to buy. The stock is trading at $105 today and is down 25% in the past year. Considering its history and growth potential, it is cheap for the tech sector.

2023-03-29 00:00:00+00:00,Is Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (NULG) a Strong ETF Right Now?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-nuveen-esg-large-cap-growth-etf-nulg-a-strong-etf-right-now,"Making its debut on 12/13/2016, smart beta exchange traded fund Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (NULG) provides investors broad exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Growth category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.
Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance.
Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.
Fund Sponsor & Index
The fund is sponsored by Nuveen. It has amassed assets over $906.66 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Growth. Before fees and expenses, NULG seeks to match the performance of the TIAA ESG USA Large-Cap Growth Index.
The TIAA ESG USA Large-Cap Growth Index is comprised of equity securities of large capitalization companies listed on US exchanges & meet ESG criteria & exhibit overall growth style characteristics based on long-term forward EPS growth rate, short-term forward EPS growth rate, current internal growth rate, long-term historical EPS growth trend & long-term historical sales per share growth trend.
Cost & Other Expenses
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for NULG are 0.25%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.37%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 38.90% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Healthcare round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) accounts for about 11.60% of total assets, followed by Nvidia Corp (NVDA) and Home Depot Inc (HD).
Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 36.06% of NULG's total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF has added about 9.41% and is down about -11.87% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 03/29/2023), respectively. NULG has traded between $45 and $62.03 during this last 52-week period.
The ETF has a beta of 1.12 and standard deviation of 24.70% for the trailing three-year period. With about 76 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Growth segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.
IShares ESG Aware MSCI EAFE ETF (ESGD) tracks MSCI EAFE ESG Focus Index and the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ESGU) tracks MSCI USA ESG Focus Index. IShares ESG Aware MSCI EAFE ETF has $7.01 billion in assets, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF has $13.89 billion. ESGD has an expense ratio of 0.20% and ESGU charges 0.15%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Growth.

2023-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,The 3 Best Tech Stocks to Buy for Exposure to Artificial Intelligence,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-3-best-tech-stocks-to-buy-for-exposure-to-artificial-intelligence,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Artificial intelligence (AI) is at an inflection point, creating new possibilities for innovation and automation in numerous industries. With the ability to analyze massive amounts of data, recognize patterns and learn from experience, it has the potential to revolutionize the way we work and live. According to PwC, it could contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. As a result, there will be a massive tailwind for AI tech stocks that provide the necessary tools and infrastructure.
As broad AI adoption accelerates, businesses are using large language models (LLMs) and generative AI to transform their operations. In data analysis, machine learning algorithms can now identify patterns and trends faster than human analysts.
For instance, in healthcare, AI models are fast tracking the development of new treatments, providing quicker diagnosis and improving patient outcomes. Similarly, autonomous AI-powered robots and systems can perform complex tasks by learning from experience and making decisions based on real-time data. For this reason, AI will revolutionize transportation, logistics and manufacturing industries where autonomous systems can improve efficiency, reduce costs and increase safety.
Developing, training, managing and improving LLMs and machine learning algorithms requires high-performance chips and resources. Therefore, as AI adoption increases, AI tech stocks will be key beneficiaries.
Microsoft (MSFT)

While the Redmond-based technology behemoth is known for its traditional businesses, such as Windows and Office, it has made significant investments in AI in recent years.
Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI research division, Microsoft Research, has made significant contributions to the field of AI. For instance, it developed the deep learning framework CNTK (Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit). Furthermore, the company is partnering with leading innovators in the field. The latest example is a collaboration with OpenAI to introduce a more powerful large language model to Bing search. 
 Currently, the company offers a range of AI-related products and services. An example is Cognitive Services APIs, featuring decision-making, speech, vision and language AI models, which allow developers to add AI capabilities to their applications. Recently, through Microsoft365 Copilot, it has also integrated AI capabilities into its Office productivity tools. By embedding the power of LLMs into Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Teams, its users will improve their productivity.
In addition to its AI-related products, Microsoft will benefit from the growth of AI in the cloud computing industry. The company’s cloud computing platform, Microsoft Azure, provides the best AI supercomputing infrastructure to train models. Also, their Azure Machine Learning platform helps businesses build, optimize and scale high-quality models for their applications.
Finally, considering its breadth of investments in AI solutions, including Dragon Ambient eXperience for clinical note-taking, GitHub Copilot and Azure are set for growth in the coming years. Meanwhile, as the AI revolution plays out, Microsoft’s established business segments will continue to gush free cash flow. Moreover, as one of the only two AAA-rated companies, it is one of the safest stocks to invest in.
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, is a technology giant with a market capitalization of over $1.2 trillion. Although there are concerns due to the competitive threat from ChatGPT, Google’s AI research division, Google Brain, has been at the forefront of AI research for years. The company’s deep learning models, like LaMDA have made significant advancements in computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing.
Google has made AI a core part of its products, including Google Assistant, Google Maps, YouTube and Google Photos. For instance, it uses AI in YouTube’s video recommendation engine and to maximize return on investment (ROI) for advertisers.
Beyond AI research and development, Alphabet is also well-positioned to benefit from the growth of the AI market. The company’s cloud computing platform, Google Cloud, is a major player in the cloud computing industry and offers a range of AI services, including pre-trained machine learning models that enable clients to customize their models.
As more companies adopt AI, demand for these services will likely grow, benefiting Alphabet’s bottom line. Meanwhile, the stock trades at a reasonable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19 and has $113 billion in cash on its balance sheet.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the perfect pick-and-shovel play to participate in the AI boom. It is the leading manufacturer of graphics processing units (GPUs), which are critical components in developing and training AI models.
Nvidia’s chips power the most energy-efficient supercomputers used for quantum computing, climate science research, material science and molecular dynamic simulations. Many of the world’s leading AI researchers and companies, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google, use the company’s GPUs. 
The company’s GPUs are particularly well-suited for deep learning, a type of AI that involves training neural networks on large datasets. LLMs train on thousands of GPUs. As demand for powerful AI services grows, this only means higher demand for its chips. As LLMs continue to process more data, they will need more computing resources. Besides having the best AI chips, Nvidia is also scaling its AI ecosystem CUDA, a range of software tools for deep learning that developers use to build and train AI models.
Its AI-related revenue has been growing rapidly, with the company’s data center segment (which includes AI-related products) growing by 11% year-over-year in the most recent quarter. The company is set to grow revenues in the coming years as AI chip demand increases and cloud service providers continue to sign multi-year agreements for the new Nvidia AI cloud service offerings.

NVIDIA Declares $0.04 Dividend
On February 22, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share ($0.16 annualized). Shareholders of record as of March 8, 2023 received the payment on March 29, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.04 per share.
At the current share price of $277.77 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.06%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.19%, the lowest has been 0.02%, and the highest has been 0.50%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.12 (n=237).
The current dividend yield is 1.11 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.09. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

2023-04-06 00:00:00+00:00,Alphabet Says Google's Latest AI Chip is 1.7 Times Faster Than Nvidia. There's a Catch.,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alphabet-says-googles-latest-ai-chip-is-1.7-times-faster-than-nvidia.-theres-a-catch.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is all the rage lately. Human-like interactions from the latest generation of chatbots -- powered by generative AI systems -- has peaked public interest. Microsoft raised eyebrows when it confirmed a $10 billion investment in ChatGPT-creator OpenAI and its plans to integrate the system with its Bing search engine. Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google helped fueled the fervor with the debut of its own chatbot, Bard.
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has long been the gold standard semiconductor used for training AI systems, but being No. 1 invites and even encourages competition, as rivals are always looking to topple the leader.
Now Google is claiming to have wrested the title from Nvidia, but things are a bit more complicated.
Image source: Getty Images.
An audacious claim
In a scientific paper released Tuesday, researchers at Google claimed that a supercomputer powered by its latest tensor processing unit (TPU) -- a processor specifically designed to train AI models -- outperformed a system powered by comparable Nvidia chips.
The process involves feeding massive amounts of information through these systems to train them for specific tasks, including providing more human-like responses to questions. Because of the enormous datasets used to train these AI models, researchers strung together more than 4,000 TPUs to create a supercomputer, while using specially designed switches to disburse the workload across the massive chipsets.
Google said that in its tests, its 4th generation TPU, which the company uses to train its own AI systems, were as much as 1.7 times faster and 1.9 times more power efficient than Nvidia's comparable A100 Tensor Core GPU.
This would seem to suggest that Google has succeeded in knocking Nvidia off its lofty perch, which would be of great concern to Nvidia shareholders -- but the devil is in the details and the results aren't as cut and dry as you might expect.
Not apples-to-apples
When technology moves at the speed of sound, the latest news is often outdated before the ink is dry and that appears to be the case here.
Early last year, Nvidia announced the development of the H100 ""Hopper"" chip, which the company said would be nine times faster for training AI models and up to 30 times faster for inference -- the process of using the models after they've been trained -- when compared with its A100 chip. The company also said the H100 was the most ""power-efficient Nvidia GPU to date."" This suggests that Nvidia's H100 processor likely outperforms Google's latest TPU across the board.
Google disclosed that it didn't compare its 4th-Gen TPU to the H100 because Nvidia's latest flagship processor hit the market after the research was completed. But the company did suggest that additional upgrades were on the drawing board, noting that Google has ""a healthy pipeline of future chips.""
What these developments mean for investors
It's important for investors to put these latest developments into historical context. This isn't the first time Google has claimed its AI-centric processor was better than a comparable one by Nvidia, only to be outdone by Nvidia's latest innovations.
In its fiscal 2023 (which ended Jan. 29), Nvidia spent $7.34 billion on research and development (R&D) expenses, up 27% compared to fiscal 2022. Not only that, R&D costs last year represented 27% of Nvidia's revenue, up from 20% in the prior year.
This helps illustrate why Nvidia has been the king of the AI-processor hill for so long -- its breakneck pace of innovation. The company's GPUs continue to be the gold standard for training and inference in AI systems. Nvidia has consistently demonstrated its ability to stay one step ahead of all comers, even those with massive size and gargantuan budgets.
That's not to say Alphabet isn't also a worthwhile investment -- which is why I own both.

NVIDIA Declares $0.04 Dividend
On February 22, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share ($0.16 annualized). Shareholders of record as of March 8, 2023 received the payment on March 29, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.04 per share.
At the current share price of $271.69 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.06%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.19%, the lowest has been 0.02%, and the highest has been 0.50%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.12 (n=237).
The current dividend yield is 1.08 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.09. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

Recession fears dominated trade upon the release of Federal Reserve minutes, even as inflation numbers indicated that the central bank’s policies were taking effect. All three major indexes ended in the red.
How Did the Benchmarks Perform?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 0.1% or 38.29 points to close at 33,646.5. Sixteen components of the 30-stock index ended in negative territory, while 14 ended in positive.
The S&P 500 lost 0.4% or 16.99 points to close at 4,091.95. Seven of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLBK) declined 1.6%, 1% and 0.6%, respectively, while the Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) advanced 0.3%.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 102.54 points, or 0.9%, to finish at 11,929.34.
The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) remained flat at 19.09. A total of 10.4 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 11.8 billion. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, a 1.69-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.
Headline CPI Comes in Lower
The session had started on a good note, with headline inflation barely increasing in March. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) had advanced 0.1% last month after rising 0.4% in February. This compares to the consensus estimate of 2% for the current period, and was cheered by investors. The Fed would most likely interpret the numbers as evidence that its stringent policy moves have started taking effect. President Joe Biden shared this buoyant mood and said that the sharp slowdown in the inflation rate meant ""more breathing room for hard-working Americans.""
However, core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, remained significantly hot albeit on par with expectations, rising 0.4% in March. In February, it had increased 0.5% and is still way above the Fed’s target rate of 0.2%.
Fed Minutes Cast a Pall on the Market
The relief from the CPI report did not last long, with the Fed minutes getting published as the day progressed. The March meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee included a presentation from staff members on the potential repercussions of the baking sector crisis that began in early March, and it does not paint a rosy picture.
The minutes did show, however, that Fed members had seriously pondered on a rate pause but had finally voted to increase the interest rate by 25 bps, the ninth increase over the past year. The rate, thus, currently stands at a target range of 4.75-5%, its highest level since late 2007. As a fallout of the banking crisis, Fed officials expect gross domestic product growth of a frugal 0.4% for 2023. Even as the minutes noted that the bail-out programs initiated by the treasury helped the struggling financial sector, officials expected lending to tighten and credit conditions to deteriorate. In other words, rate hikes are probably not going away anytime soon if the crisis deepens further.
The way the market has been reacting to chatter about continued rate hikes, it did not come as a surprise that recession became a major talking point on Wednesday. It may be argued that only after the Fed definitively signals a rate pause, this trend might change. On cue, growth and tech stocks, consumer discretionaries declined the most. Tech has been on a free-fall all week.

2023-04-14 00:00:00+00:00,Investors Heavily Search NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Here is What You Need to Know,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investors-heavily-search-nvidia-corporation-nvda%3A-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-5,"Nvidia (NVDA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Over the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +3.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +7.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 13.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -32.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $4.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +34.7%. This estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.98 indicates a change of +32.9% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nvidia.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
In the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $6.5 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.6%. The $29.68 billion and $37.11 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10% and +25%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Nvidia reported revenues of $6.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.8%. EPS of $0.88 for the same period compares with $1.32 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.61%. The EPS surprise was +8.64%.
Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Numerous strategies exist to maximize gains in the stock market. However, investing in progressive growth stocks is among the most effective. Companies with developed business models and solid growth engines make some of the best long-term investments for those seeking capital appreciation. I tend to look at sectors with strong growth trends, such as the semiconductor space, where a number of high-profile chip stocks to buy for growth can be found in spades.
Like all sectors, there’s nuance to the semiconductor industry. Not all chip stocks are equal. Plus, while there is competition in this sector, there are a few companies which really dominate certain, and very profitable, niches.
With that said, here are the three top chip stocks I’ve got on my watch list right now.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: Shutterstock
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a well-known semiconductor chip maker and market leader. The company’s stock has witnessed an impressive surge of almost 90% in 2023, causing the market capitalization to peak at around $689 billion. With a focus on developing chips that offer high-quality graphics, Nvidia’s products are widely sought after for computer gaming.
Nvidia is making impressive advancements through its association with the popular ChatGPT online chatbot developed by OpenAI. OpenAI uses Nvidia’s chips to train its extensive language models. Moreover, Nvidia has extended its reach by offering its DGX Cloud platform online, making it accessible to a broader range of businesses to develop artificial intelligence tools. With these exciting developments, the possibilities for NVDA are boundless.
After a considerable decline in 2022, NVDA shares rebounded and are performing well in 2023. Nevertheless, the stock is still trading approximately 30% lower than its peak in November 2021. While the stock’s valuation remains high, Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about investing in NVDA. It has received a strong buy consensus rating from analysts. These ratings have led to an average analyst estimate of $256.39 per share for NVDA stock, suggesting a possible upside of around 10%.
Nvidia maintains its fundamental growth drivers, positioning it as one of the most lucrative companies for investors to assign a higher-than-market multiple. Its robust fundamentals and growth tailwinds suggest this is among the best chip stocks to buy for long-term growth.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), a company that prides itself on semiconductor innovation, periodically faces price drops that can be seen as a blessing. Financial traders need not panic during these dips. Instead, such dips present an opportunity for investors to consider adding to their holdings of AMD stock.
Like Nvidia, AMD stock surged in March. Indeed, this dramatic increase of approximately 25% last month may not be repeatable in April, especially given how the month has started. Though, it’s important for investors to keep in mind that this is a stock that peaked out around $155 in November 2021. Thus, there is still an opportunity for AMD stock to rise in value, if investors believe new all-time highs are on the horizon from here.
The question is whether AMD stock represents a solid bet, in the sea of options in this space. Accordingly, it’s important to assess AMD’s business model and valuation for insight.
Investors like Advanced Micro Devices due to its next-generation chips. In fact, the company just introduced its fourth-generation EPYC Embedded CPUs, putting the company in an enviable position in the sector.
It’s expected growth from these next-generation chips could lead to significant profitability over time. While AMD has lagged behind Nvidia in this department, it’s also a stock that’s more fairly valued. Currently, AMD stock trades at a trailing price-earnings multiple of around 110 times, compared to Nvidia’s multiple of more than 150 times.
Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)

Rounding out this list of chip stocks to buy is perhaps the best option of them all. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is the largest global player for producing advanced semiconductors.
There are many reasons why investors look to Taiwan Semi as one of the best options in this space. Of course, size matters. Accordingly, TSM stock provides investors with the size and scale that’s extremely difficult to build, especially in a complex space like semiconductors.
Notably, Taiwan Semi and grown its revenue by 18% annually, on a compounded basis, since 1994. This is the kind of growth companies of Taiwan Semi’s size shouldn’t be able to produce. However, a continuation of growth is expected moving forward, as global chip demand provides sustained revenue growth momentum into this year.
Who knows what will happen in this sector. However, TSM stock does appear to provide solid value right now, trading around 13.5 times trailing earnings. Accordingly, for those looking for chip stocks with size, scale, profitability and growth potential, TSM stock could be the best pick of them all.

2023-04-19 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia Is a Top Stock to Bet On in Quantum Computing,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-is-a-top-stock-to-bet-on-in-quantum-computing,"In many ways, the current spate of generative artificial intelligence (AI) services like ChatGPT can thank Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) for their existence. Nvidia researches and designs semiconductors that accelerate computing time -- most notably GPUs (graphics processing units), originally used for high-end video game graphics and now being applied to train large-language models (LLMs) that ChatGPT runs on.
But a new breed of computing accelerator is being developed: quantum computing. Nvidia has announced software geared toward quantum computing researchers over the last few years. But does its latest hardware announcement, the DGX Quantum, propel the company into the world of designing quantum computing systems, too?
Nvidia: the quantum computing company?
Nvidia's DGX Quantum is actually a collaboration with Israeli start-up Quantum Machines, which makes some hardware components for a quantum computing system. Specifically, DGX Quantum features a new Nvidia Grace Hopper GPU paired with an OPX+ from Quantum Machines, a ""quantum control"" unit that orchestrates the operations of a quantum computer.
The DGX Quantum, an Nvidia Grace Hopper GPU system paired with a Quantum Machines OPX+. Image source: Nvidia.
What does that mean? DGX Quantum isn't itself a quantum computer. Rather, it's a component in a quantum computing system, albeit an important one at this early stage of research and development for practical use of quantum computing.
According to Nvidia, a complete quantum computer requires a QPU (quantum computing processor, akin to a CPU or GPU), a system to perform operations on the QPU, a way to measure and record the resulting data, and a way to create and connect multiple QPUs that can operate with each other.
Quantum DGX is thus a means to govern the operation of this quantum computer system. And Quantum DGX will also make use of Nvidia's CUDA Quantum software stack, a hybrid platform of classical computing (CPUs and GPUs) and quantum computing (QPUs) that unifies an entire system to make it useful for researchers.
A growing number of quantum computer operators (like the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan), quantum hardware makers IonQ, and start-up software developers (Agnostiq and QMware) have adopted CUDA Quantum in their operations.
The first deployment of the Quantum DGX hardware, the Israel Quantum Computing Center, is expected by the end of 2023.
A bet on an unknown future
At its most basic level, quantum computing is simply a means to further speed up computing times, enabling researchers to experiment with big problems that classical computers can't solve. Accelerated computing is Nvidia's specialty, so dabbling in quantum computing research is a natural fit for the semiconductor company.
But as its management told me in a recent conversation, widespread commercialization of quantum computing is still likely many years off. And when it does start to take root, quantum computing will supplement classical computing, not replace it -- much like Nvidia GPUs have accelerated the work traditionally handled by CPUs, not replaced them. Think of quantum computing and the QPUs that power them as another (future) extension of the classical computing work already done up to this point.
And given their industry-leading performance, Nvidia GPUs are helping propel this virtuous cycle of using the most advanced technology of today to develop the cutting edge technology of tomorrow.
Given that quantum computing is in its nascent stage, most investors who want to bet on it would be best suited by sticking to long-term ownership of stocks like Nvidia at this juncture.

2023-04-20 00:00:00+00:00,3 ETFs to Buy for the AI Revolution,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-etfs-to-buy-for-the-ai-revolution,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been the talk of Wall Street this year, especially when it comes to new technologies and growth avenues. AI continues to grow at an alarming rate, leaving consumers and investors scrambling to keep up. It’s got the latter group looking for AI ETFs to buy.
No one knows where the next ChatGPT will come from or when it will pop up. Since hitting the scene in November 2022, ChatGPT has blown up in popularity. It garnered millions of subscribers in record time and new platforms seem to pop up overnight.
There’s no question that AI is transforming the way that we’re using technology. It’s not a fad and it’s not going away. Rules will likely be put in place, or there will be an attempt to, but as the saying goes “the cat is out of the bag.”
So now the big question is how can investors position themselves to take advantage?
Invesco QQQ Trust Series (QQQ)
Source: Shutterstock
I would start with the Invesco QQQ Trust Series ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ). While this ETF is hardly obscure and is one of the most popular trading vehicles in the market. It is a worthy consideration when looking for AI ETFs to buy.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the top holding in QQQ, with a weighting of 12.63%. The tech giant has been positioning itself to have a great foothold in the AI space.
As soon as ChatGPT showed off its stuff, Microsoft moved quickly to make a multi-billion dollar investment in the platform’s parent company, OpenAI. Now Microsoft is working to integrate AI into its search and browser products, as well as its other platforms aimed at enterprise use.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is another top holding in QQQ, coming in as the fourth-largest holding. Nvidia produces the hardware that makes AI possible. While others will eventually enter its domain, Nvidia is the king of AI chips for the moment.
VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)

Another ETF where Nvidia is a top holding? The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH). Only in this case, Nvidia is the top holding in the fund, with a 13.66% weighting. The next largest company in the ETF is Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) with an 11.57% weighting.
That’s significant, as a quarter of the ETF is tied up in two stocks. More than 64% of SMH is invested in its top 10 holdings. So why am I picking this ETF? Put simply by Forbes:
“If you want investing exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) without betting on young, unproven companies, semiconductors may be your angle. Semiconductors are the building blocks of AI applications—so as AI adoption grows, so does the demand for semiconductors.”
None of this is possible without semiconductors and the strain and demand from new technology using AI applications is going to be intense. That means better chips, higher-end components and all-around stronger demand for the parts produced by semiconductor companies.
Global X Autonomous And Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV)

Lastly, there’s the Global X Autonomous And Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ:DRIV). While the name of the fund would lead you to believe that this is simply geared toward vehicles, it’s got more AI exposure than you’d think at first glance.
First, its top holding is Nvidia. That’s followed by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG). While there is an electric vehicle component in there, all three companies will surely play a role in AI adoption. Alphabet is working on its own AI platform called Bard, and like Microsoft, will surely look to integrate it into its existing platforms.
Other top stocks in the fund, like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Microsoft, will all benefit from, and play a role in, the future of AI as well.

As investors pored over a slew of corporate reports, Wall Street’s “fear gauge” slumped. Despite the low volatility environment, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), S&P 500 Index (SPX), and Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) were unable to take advantage. The blue-chip index is in the midst of a four-day losing streak and a fifth-straight weekly win looks untenable. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are also headed for a week in the red. Choppy oil prices and rising bond yields were in focus throughout the week as well, all while the VIX traded at its lowest level since November 2021.
Tech News This Week
Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META) is set to report earnings next week, and both analysts and options traders are chiming in ahead of the event as the stock continues to rally on the charts. Tesla Inc's (TSLA) post-earnings slide weighed on tech stocks on Thursday, and analysts hit the electric vehicle (EV) maker with bear notes ahead of the event.

2023-04-25 00:00:00+00:00,Semiconductor ETFs in Focus Ahead of Q1 Earnings,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/semiconductor-etfs-in-focus-ahead-of-q1-earnings,"The semiconductor stocks and ETFs have been rising this year on growing optimism that a sales downturn in the industry has reached its lowest point, in part due to a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Additionally, fears of recession and financial instability have compelled investors to flock to safe value companies that are old, have cash-rich balance sheets and durable revenue streams.

As such, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL and Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ have gained 22.4%, 20.1%, 14.3% and 19.7%, respectively, so far this year. The strong trend is likely to continue in the weeks ahead as the Q1 earnings season picks up pace (read: What's Up for Chip ETFs After Their Best Quarter Since 2020?).

Semiconductors have been the most important drivers of the overall growth in technology, given the use of chips in day-to-day life, from cars, to electronic gadgets, to planes and weapons. The demand will continue to trend higher given the increased digitization in various corners like healthcare, transport, financial systems, defense, agriculture and retail, among others.

The rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology like cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, AI, cryptocurrencies, 5G and other advanced information technologies should continue to fuel growth. Further, the introduction of expensive and new-generation chips has been leading to an enhancement in the product mix for semiconductors.

Some other well-known players in the space, such as Intel INTC, Qualcomm QCOM, NVIDIA NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD, will report earnings in the coming days. Let’s delve into the financial picture of the companies that have a higher allocation in the above-mentioned ETFs and the power to move the funds up or down as Q1 earnings unfold. SOXQ is largely concentrated on four firms with a combined share of 30.2%, followed by 29.2% for SMH, 26.4% for SOXX and 21.6% for FTXL.

Per our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Inside Our Earnings Prediction
Intel is slated to release earnings after market close on Apr 27. It has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -3.01%. The stock saw negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Intel delivered a negative earnings surprise of 6.42%, on average, for the preceding four quarters.

Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -1.10%. The stock witnessed no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter and delivered an earnings surprise of 3.75% in the trailing four quarters, on average. The company is expected to report earnings after the closing bell on May 3 (see: all the Technology ETFs here).

NVIDIA, expected to report on May 24, has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3.20%, on average, over the past four quarters. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the quarter to be reported (read: 5 Tech Stocks That Powered Nasdaq ETF in the First Quarter).

Advanced Micro Devices has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Its earnings surprise history is impressive, with the average beat being 2.81% for the preceding four quarters. The stock witnessed no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the quarter to be reported. The company is slated to report earnings on May 2 after the closing bell.
Conclusion
Though the companies do not expect to surprise on earnings this season, semiconductor ETFs might see smooth trading in the weeks ahead as SOXX, SMH and FTXL have a Zacks ETF Rank #2 or 3. This suggests their strong performance in the weeks ahead.

2023-04-27 00:00:00+00:00,Stinky Breadth: FAANG Masks Market Weakness Beneath the Surface,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stinky-breadth%3A-faang-masks-market-weakness-beneath-the-surface,"FAANG’s Dominance
FAANG is an acronym that stands for Facebook (now Meta Platforms (META)), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (now Alphabet (GOOGL)). The “FAANG” stocks rose to prominence over the past decade due to their strong price and fundamental performance and massive market caps. Since their initial rise, investors have often added to the group of stocks and have included the likes of stocks such as Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA).

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Pictured: META and the FAANG names are outperforming the general market by a longshot.
Though the market has thousands of stocks to choose from, these stocks have earned the hype and popularity and continue to be the overwhelming choice of retail and tech-oriented institutional investors. Despite their already massive size, these stocks continue to gain market share through innovation, high growth, and market dominance. To give you an idea of FAANG’s dominance, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon now comprise around 30% of the market cap weighting of the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ).
Mega-Cap Tech’s Outsized Performance
Because three in four stocks tend to follow the general market’s direction, in the 2022 bear market, most stocks fell – including FAANG. However, in 2023, FAANG stocks are once again outperforming – and the performance is becoming more profound. For example, Microsoft leaped 7% on earnings earlier this week. Meta Platforms is up more than 10% this morning following its report. Conversely, smaller growth-tech names such as Mobileye (MBLY), Impinj (PI), and Netgear (NTGR) are getting clobbered by 10% or more after their reports.
Stinky Breadth
The dichotomy between mega-cap tech stocks and traditional growth names is the largest in recent times. Does it matter, though? The short answer is yes, eventually, it will matter. Weak participation (also known as breadth), can be sustained in the short-term. However, eventually the stocks that are holding the market indices up will succumb to gravity and pullback. In other words, you shouldn’t trust an index’s move just because it is marching higher – a few large weighted stocks, such as Microsoft, can skew the results and mask weakness beneath the surface.
An Easy Way to Gauge Participation
There are many ways to gauge market breadth, including the advance/decline line, new highs & new lows, and the up/down volume. However, one of the easiest methods I have found is to simply compare an equal-weighted index to a market cap-weighted index. Below is a year-to-date performance chart of QQQ – the most popular tech ETF.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
While QQQ is up 17% in 2023, the Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight Index (QQQE) is only up a feeble 8%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
In other words, currently, the market is being held up by just a few strong mega-cap stocks.
Takeaway
A signficant dichotomy exists in the market between QQQ and QQQE. Investors should not simply take an index’s performance at face value but rather take the time to compare it to an equal-weighted index. Breadth is an important concept to understand as a rally is only sustainable for a long period of time with strong participation. Remember, a few large-cap stocks can mask the performance beneath the surface.

April 28 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O said on Friday it signed a 10-year deal with Nware to bring Xbox and Activision Blizzard ATVI.O games to the Spanish cloud-gaming platform, days after Britain blocked its $69 billion buyout of the ""Call of Duty"" maker.
The agreement marks the latest effort by Microsoft to ease fears its purchase of Activision would hinder competition in cloud gaming, which was the reason cited by the Competition and Markets Authority to veto the biggest deal in gaming.
""While it's still early for the emerging cloud segment in gaming, this new partnership combined with our other recent commitments will make more popular games available on more cloud game streaming services than they are today,"" Microsoft President Brad Smith said.
The Xbox console maker, which plans to appeal CMA's decision, has signed similar deals with the owners of streaming platforms including Valve Corp, Nvidia NVDA.O and Boosteroid.
It had also offered Sony - a vocal opponent of the deal - a 10-year ""Call of Duty"" license, in line with an agreement to bring the multi-billion dollar franchise to Nintendo's Switch.
In its decision on Wednesday, the CMA said Microsoft had an estimated 60%-70% of global cloud gaming services as well as competitive advantages including owning Xbox, PC operating system Windows and cloud provider Azure.
The Activision deal is the biggest involving technology companies the regulator has blocked. Europe will decide on the deal by May 22. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also seeking to block it.
Microsoft shares were slightly lower in U.S. premarket trading, while those of Activision ticked up 0.2%.

2023-05-02 00:00:00+00:00,Bear of the Day: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM),NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bear-of-the-day%3A-taiwan-semiconductor-tsm,"Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is the giant chip foundry that serves the world's most important manufacturers, like Apple and NVIDIA.

These big clients are considered ""fabless"" because they rely on foundries like Samsung and Taiwan Semi (aka, TSMC) to conduct wafer fabrication of their designs.

On April 20, TSMC reported profit of $6.8 billion in its first quarter. On a per-share basis, the Hsinchu, Taiwan-based company said it had profit of $1.31, which beat the Zacks Consensus estimate of $1.21 by 8.25%.

The chip company posted revenue of $16.72 billion in the period, versus consensus of $16.81B. ""Our first quarter business was impacted by weakening macroeconomic conditions and softening end market demand, which led customers to adjust their demand accordingly"" said Wendell Huang, VP and CFO of TSMC.

And reaction to the quarter and outlook has skewed negative with estimates for this year being taken down by several analysts.

Since the report, the EPS consensus has fallen from $5.57 to $5.33, representing a 19% drop in annual growth versus last year.

Meanwhile, projected revenues of $71.6 billion for this year are expected to come in 5.65% shy against 2022.

What's Driving the Slowdown As NVDA Soars?

This softening outlook comes after years of strong high-tech growth -- TSMC revenues have more than doubled since 2019 -- and may now pivot on three different catalysts.

First, geopolitical tensions with Taiwan have scared some investors away, including Warren Buffett who reportedly sold all his TSM shares bought last year.

Second, as Artificial Intelligence and ChatGPT fuel the current fortunes of companies like NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT), the chips they need fabricated by TSM run on a much longer planning and production cycle.

And now we are hearing about delays in the next micro-revolution in chip architecture. Engineers regularly design and build integrated circuits and transistors at the sub-10 nanometer scale (a billionth of a meter).

The next evolution includes designs for 3nm. But as DigiTimes reported last week, TSMC's major fabless clients may defer their 3nm chip rollouts. ""TSMC has obtained 3nm chip order commitments from vendors including AMD (AMD), NVIDIA, and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are all looking to defer the delivery of their 3nm generation devices,"" DigiTimes' Monica Chen and Jessie Shen reported, citing industry sources.

Thirdly, there is the complicated issue of semiconductor trade, tariffs, and subsidies. The WSJ is reporting that TSMC is pushing back on some subsidy conditions. With plans to invest $40 billion in two chip factories in Arizona, TSMC is arguing that some of the conditions Washington has attached to subsidies are ""unacceptable.""

As TSMC looks for up to $15 billion in government subsidies, The Wall Street Journal's Yang Jie reports the company is concerned about rules that could require it to share profits from the factories and provide detailed information about operations.

Bottom line on TSM: This key global player in semiconductor innovation is a core part of any tech investor's portfolio. But after blistering industry growth, the headwinds substantiate the pause.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the world and the stock market is no exception. AI-powered algorithms are now being used to predict stock prices, identify investment opportunities and even manage portfolios. A great example of AI stock predictions yielding good results is the ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ), which employs AI as a tool for their research. Meanwhile, a bad example of AI stock predictions would be AI Powered Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:AIEQ), which uses AI as a replacement for human analysts instead of a tool, and it has so far delivered poor and underwhelming results.
With that in mind, I strongly encourage you to not use AI stock predictions as a replacement for traditional screening and analysis of the market. Instead, use it as a tool to bolster or gain more clarification on the stock or its underlying business.
We’ll be doing just that with Google’s Bard AI. While some may call it a letdown, it is trained on a larger and newer dataset than OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Bing AI. Bard also outperformed these two when it came to a performance test.
Let’s look at what it has to say.
Me: Hi, Bard! I am writing an article for InvestorPlace.com about “7 Stocks to Buy Now That Can Make You Rich.” Can you help me with seven stock picks that fit the criteria?
Here’s what I got:
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Daniel Fung / Shutterstock
Bard: “Amazon is the world’s largest online retailer and a leader in cloud computing. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of e-commerce and the cloud computing market.”
While AI algorithms like Bard do not provide thorough research and specific metrics about the business or the stock, I believe the argument for buying Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is solid. Amazon has a solid foothold in the cloud computing industry, which has slowed down in recent months, but it is still among the fastest-growing sectors in IT. The AWS segment grew 16% year-over-year in Q1, down from 20% in Q4 last year. Overall revenue growth also reached near double-digit figures, and analysts expect ~12% growth here in 2024.
E-commerce may also be returning to a healthy growth trajectory after the post-Covid-19 correction. Amazon posted a 3% increase in online store sales, discounting foreign exchange fluctuations. I believe this segment will continue to accelerate in future years, mainly driven by the newer generations’ preference for online shopping. Morgan Stanley also expects the e-commerce growth to return to healthy levels.
Thus, AMZN is definitely a buy in my book at this price range. Most analysts think so too, with 37 “Buy,” 1 “Hold,” and no sell ratings, with a 34.4% upside potential by Apr. 2024.
Tesla (TSLA)

Bard: “Tesla is a leading electric vehicle manufacturer. The company is growing rapidly and is poised to become a major player in the automotive industry. Tesla is also a leader in the development of self-driving cars.”
This may be an unpopular opinion with some, if not, many investors, but I would disagree with Bard’s pick. I believe investors should put a hold on buying Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) right now as the market is re-evaluating what the company is actually worth. Tesla’s earnings decline, even if it’s temporary, is not a good look for the company. In combination, the company’s price cuts have dragged down its margins, which is among the best factors that set it apart from other electric vehicle (EV) makers. Analysts also anticipate EPS to decline further to $3.44 in 2024, and that’ll inflate the earnings multiple even more.
All things considered, the stock’s valuation looks steep, and it won’t be improving anytime soon. Investors care less about volume and more about profits; thus, I see TSLA stock being much cheaper in the near future. Meanwhile, there are better deals in the market with much more upside potential, where analysts don’t have mixed feelings. This option just proves that not all AI stock predictions are a win.
NVIDIA (NVDA)

Bard: “NVIDIA is a leading semiconductor company that is well-positioned for growth in the years to come. The company is a leader in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, and it is also expanding into new areas such as artificial intelligence and autonomous driving.”
This option is would not make the top of my list for AI stock predictions either. Much like Tesla, NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) valuation seems too inflated, and investors should take a pass. Sure, machine learning algorithms have been remarkable so far in terms of what they can do, and NVIDIA dominates the AI chip industry. But that does not mean that it will remain this way forever.
I believe the AI growth story is only starting, and by the time these AI algorithms do start generating revenue, or even profits for that matter, companies like NVIDIA will likely have lots of competitors. It is a fabless chip maker, and companies like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) won’t have too much of a hard time catching up. In fact, Qualcomm’s AI chips are already beating NVIDIA’s when it comes to power efficiency.
Regardless, a stock up 102% year-to-date with a $714 billion market capitalization is too hot. The business’ financials are declining, and the speculation baked into NVDA makes it a risky and irrational buy. Avoid.
Block (SQ)
Source: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com
Bard: “Block is a leading financial technology company that is well-positioned for growth in the years to come. The company offers a variety of products and services, including Square Cash, Square Capital, and Square Terminal.”
Block (NYSE:SQ) seems more or less fairly valued if we consider the tough macroeconomic conditions on the horizon for late 2023. But if we’re looking at a multi-year timeframe, this is a solid pick since the downside risk is relatively low, trading below 2019 levels. Additionally, analysts have very bullish sentiments about the stock, with a $96.6 price target, reflecting 60% upside.
There are concerns about the Hindenburg report, but I believe the fears are overblown as the company’s financials justify its current valuation.
PayPal (PYPL)
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com
Bard: “PayPal is a leading digital payments company that is well-positioned for growth in the years to come. The company is a leader in the online payments market, and it is also expanding into new areas such as mobile payments and in-store payments.”
PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a better buy than Block, in my opinion, as it is a profit-generating company and enjoys worldwide recognition, and almost all vendors support it for transactions. In terms of growth though, PayPal lags behind as its revenue growth rate is 6.8% for the year, while Block’s growth for the same period is 14.3%. However, the gap in growth is forecast to shrink in the coming years as the room for growth shrinks for Block.
Analysts agree that PYPL has a similar upside potential to SQ, albeit slightly less. But that is worth it, considering the investigations Block is under.
Shopify (SHOP)
Source: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com
Bard: “Shopify is a leading e-commerce platform that is well-positioned for growth in the years to come. The company is a leader in the small business e-commerce market, and it is also expanding into new areas such as enterprise e-commerce and international markets.”
Much like Amazon, I believe Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is an excellent pick due to the e-commerce sector’s continuing growth, but only in a multi-year timeframe. I believe it has appreciated enough to compensate for its earlier selloffs and is likely to trade sideways in this macroeconomic environment for at least the next few months.
The company’s sales have increased by 25.7% to $1.74 billion in Q4, showing strong momentum. It is expected to end 2023 with 19% growth before re-accelerating to 21% in 2024.
Still, I would reiterate that the upside potential here might be limited in the near term. Analysts see only a 5% upside in the next 12 months.
Meta Platforms (FB)
Source: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com
Bard: “Meta Platforms is a leading social media company that is well-positioned for growth in the years to come. The company is a leader in the social media market, and it is also expanding into new areas such as virtual reality and augmented reality.”
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been a hotly debated stock in the past two years due to the company’s heavy expenditure on the metaverse. It has so far spent billions on the loss-making project, which has shaved hundreds of billions off META’s market cap.
Nowadays, it is more of a debate about whether or not the metaverse will be a successful project. But I think the strong underlying business should call for a buy at this range, making this a win.

2023-05-05 00:00:00+00:00,Meta Platforms scoops up AI networking chip team from Graphcore,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/meta-platforms-scoops-up-ai-networking-chip-team-from-graphcore,"By Katie Paul
May 5 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc META.O has hired an Oslo-based team that until late last year was building artificial-intelligence networking technology at British chip unicorn Graphcore.
A Meta spokesperson confirmed the hirings in response to a request for comment, after Reuters identified 10 people whose LinkedIn profiles said they worked at Graphcore until December 2022 or January 2023 and subsequently joined Meta in February or March of this year.
""We recently welcomed a number of highly-specialized engineers in Oslo to our infrastructure team at Meta. They bring deep expertise in the design and development of supercomputing systems to support AI and machine learning at scale in Meta's data centers,"" said Jon Carvill, the Meta spokesperson.
The move brings additional muscle to the social media giant's bid to improve how its data centers handle AI work, as it races to cope with demand for AI-oriented infrastructure from teams across the company looking to build new features.
Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has become increasingly reliant on AI technology to target advertising, select posts for its apps' feeds and purge banned content from its platforms.
On top of that, it is now rushing to join competitors like Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google in releasing generative AI products capable of creating human-like writing, art and other content, which investors see as the next big growth area for tech companies.
The 10 employees' job descriptions on LinkedIn indicated the team had worked on AI-specific networking technology at Graphcore, which develops computer chips and systems optimized for AI work.
Carvill declined to say what they would be working on at Meta.
Graphcore closed its Oslo office as part of a broader restructuring announced in October last year, a spokesperson for the startup said, as it struggled to make inroads against U.S.-based firms like Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O which dominate the market for AI chips.
Meta already has an in-house unit designing several kinds of chips aimed at speeding up and maximizing efficiency for its AI work, including a network chip that performs a sort of air traffic control function for servers, two sources told Reuters.
Efficient networking is especially useful for modern AI systems like those behind chatbot ChatGPT or image-generation tool Dall-E, which are far too large to fit onto a single computing chip and must instead be split up over many chips strung together.
A new category of network chip has emerged to help keep data moving smoothly within those computing clusters. Nvidia, AMD and Intel Corp INTC.O all make such network chips.
In addition to its network chip, Meta is also designing a complex computing chip to both train AI models and perform inference, a process in which the trained models make judgments and generate responses to prompts, although it does not expect that chip to be ready until around 2025.
Graphcore, one of the UK's most valuable tech startups, once was seen by investors like Microsoft and venture capital firm Sequoia as a promising potential challenger to Nvidia's commanding lead in the market for AI chip systems.
However, it faced a setback in 2020 when Microsoft scrapped an early deal to buy Graphcore's chips for its Azure cloud computing platform, according to a report by UK newspaper The Times. Microsoft instead used Nvidia's GPUs to build the massive infrastructure powering ChatGPT developer OpenAI, which Microsoft also backs.
Sequoia has since written down its investment in Graphcore to zero, although it remains on the company's board, according to a source familiar with the relationship. The write-down was first reported by Insider in October.
The Graphcore spokesperson confirmed the setbacks, but said the company was ""perfectly positioned"" to take advantage of accelerating commercial adoption of AI.
Graphcore was last valued at $2.8 billion after raising $222 million in its most recent investment round in 2020.

FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.
What if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?
Nvidia's Business In-Depth
With that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.
NVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.

NVIDIA’s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company’s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.

NVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company’s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.

NVIDIA’s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company’s GPUs power the top two supercomputers in the world, located at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan. In all, NVIDIA powers 136 of the TOP500 supercomputers.

Santa Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023, slightly up from $26.91 billion in fiscal 2022.

Beginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments – Graphics and Compute & Networking.

Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.

Compute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.

Graphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 44% and 56% of fiscal 2023 revenues, respectively.
Bottom Line
Putting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Nvidia, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.
According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2013 would be worth $82,710.89, or an 8,171.09% gain, as of May 8, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.
The S&P 500 rose 156.21% and the price of gold increased 31.59% over the same time frame in comparison.
Analysts are anticipating more upside for NVDA.
NVIDIA is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect its Automotive segment’s revenue to grow at a CAGR of 29% through fiscal 2023-2025. However, NVDA’s near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and data center chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.
Shares have gained 6.08% over the past four weeks and there have been 3 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

So far in 2023, an investment in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has yielded outstanding results. What’s the long-term outlook for NVDA stock, though? If you believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is here to stay, then don’t be too surprised if the Nvidia share price is significantly higher in five years than it is today.
Some folks, including video game fanatics, might only think of Nvidia as a manufacturer of graphics processing units (GPUs). Yet, there’s more to Nvidia in the 2020s, as the company is making a name for itself in the AI hardware market.
In addition, Nvidia is boldly venturing into AI-related software. You just never know what Nvidia might do next, so be prepared for the company to continue innovating in multiple tech markets and providing ongoing value to the shareholders.
AI Supercomputers Enhance the Bull Case for NVDA Stock
Not long ago, OpenAI’s ChatGPT popularized generative AI platforms. However, ChatGPT and other chatbots are typically known to be power-intensive. Nvidia’s A100 chip is designed to address this need, as it delivers the intense computational power that generative AI platforms often require.
Nvidia stock traders should know that the A100 chip isn’t the company’s only foray into AI-compatible hardware, though. The company has also introduced its DGX supercomputers, which are now “running 24/7 at businesses across the world to refine data and process AI.” Moreover, CEO Jensen Huang even went so far as to call Nvidia’s DGX supercomputers “modern AI factories.”
Customers around the globe — in Japan, Ecuador, Sweden and elsewhere — are deploying Nvidia’s DGX H100 supercomputers “like AI factories to manufacture intelligence.” From healthcare to legal research, higher education to digital advertising and beyond, the use cases for Nvidia’s supercomputers continue to grow in 2023.
Nvidia Addresses a Major Issue With Generative AI
AI chatbots are now part of the mainstream culture. However, some might wonder whether these programs are reliable and safe. Indeed, skeptics of generative AI could point to instances of chatbots delivering responses that are inaccurate, inappropriate or even dangerous.
Nvidia is now offering a tool called NeMo Guardrails to address this problem. Jonathan Cohen, Nvidia’s vice president of applied research, describes NeMo Guardrails as an “open source developer tool kit to guide LLM-powered chatbots to be accurate, appropriate, on topic, and secure.”
NeMo Guardrails is designed to prevent the disclosure of confidential personal information. It can also help to reduce the dissemination of fictional/inaccurate statements. Perhaps, NeMo Guardrails will bridge the gap of trust among businesses that are distrustful of generative AI. Consequently, the adoption of NeMo Guardrails could bolster Nvidia’s customer count and top-line results.
So, Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 5 Years?
Nvidia never ceases to develop best-in-class gaming GPUs. At the same time, the company is creating groundbreaking hardware and software for AI applications. Clearly, Nvidia will continue to push the envelope and that’s exciting for the company’s customers and shareholders.
Nvidia’s leading-edge hardware will be the main driver of NVDA stock over the coming quarters. However, the company’s foray into AI-related software could also boost Nvidia’s revenue.
Therefore, I’m targeting $500 for the Nvidia stock price in five years. That’s an attainable objective, especially if Nvidia maintains its status as a leader in AI-friendly technology.

2023-05-15 00:00:00+00:00,"PC Market on the Mend, Benefits Abound for Tech ETFs",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pc-market-on-the-mend-benefits-abound-for-tech-etfs,"PCs, be they desktops or laptops, are no longer considered “high tech.” Rather, they’re essential parts of everyday life around the world. As a result, many investors don’t view this as the high-octane market segment it was several decades ago.
That doesn’t mean related investment opportunities are limited. Quite the contrary. While the PC market endured a slump over the past couple of years, some analysts believe it’s primed for a resurgence and that rebound could bring positive implications for exchange traded funds such as the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and the Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM).
Indeed, PCs represent one of the slowest growth corners of the tech sector. But consumers and businesses still need to periodically refresh their tech stack. That upgrade cycle could benefit plenty of members of the QQQ and QQQM rosters.
“If you assume that users replace their PCs every four years, which is the five-year pre-COVID average, that about 65% of the current PC installed base or roughly 760 million units is going to be due for a refresh in 2024 and 2025,” noted Morgan Stanley hardware IT analyst Erik Woodring.
Pulse on PC Market Outlook
For investors looking to capitalize on the PC upgrade cycle, QQQ and QQQM could be ideal options. Both ETFs allocate nearly 49% of their rosters to the tech sector. Within that are plenty of companies with direct ties to PC sales, including Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and to a lesser extent, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG).
Add to that, QQQ and QQQM are homes to an array of semiconductor equities with direct ties to the PC space, including Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). Perhaps adding to prospects of a PC market rebound are expectations that the bounce back will be driven by corporations.
“We think the replacements and upgrades in 2024 and 2025, will come from the commercial market. With 70% of our 2024 PC shipment growth coming from commercial entities. Commercial entities are much more regular when it comes to upgrades. And they need greater memory capacity and compute power to handle their ever-expanding workloads,” added Woodring.
The analyst also points to generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential driver of increased PC demand. Because that nascent industry requires increased, higher-cost computing power. That could boost a slew of QQQ and QQQM member firms, including chip makers such as AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).

In the coming weeks, I believe there’s a good chance that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock will fall meaningfully. But given the company’s huge opportunities in AI and automobiles, I believe that the shares’ weakness would create a very good buying opportunity for long-term investors.
NVDA Nvidia $292.54
Why NVDA Stock Looks Poised to Sink in the Next Two Weeks
Nvidia is due to report its first-quarter financial results on May 24. The value of cryptocurrencies hasn’t risen much since January, and according to many sources, PC sales reportedly bottomed last quarter. Many of Nvidia’s chips are used to power crypto mining and PCs, so both factors will likely weigh on the company’s first-quarter results. Similarly, the video game sector has not been particularly strong in recent months.
Moreover, the current tremendous interest in artificial intelligence did not start materializing until last quarter, and it takes time for companies in general and larger firms, in particular, to decide to buy and purchase products.
Also noteworthy is that Washington’s debt ceiling fight will likely weigh on equities, including NVDA stock, in the coming weeks.
And finally, the valuation of NVDA stock, which has a forward price-earnings ratio of 63, remains quite high.
Nvidia’s second-quarter guidance could align with analysts’ average estimates or even a bit better than expected. But, given the points I outlined above, I still expect the shares to sink after its Q1 earnings report.
Why Investors Should Consider Buying NVDA Stock on Weakness
As I noted in a previous column, “Nvidia’s chips that power artificial intelligence are fetching prices” 10-20 times above their usual levels, driven by the current tremendous growth of AI. And the demand for such chips is expected to only surge going forward.
Also importantly, speaking in March, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said that both “large enterprises” and “startups” were looking to buy Nvidia’s chips to power various AI applications, including “a chatbot,” and “a simulation of their factories.”
Moreover, the CFO reported that Nvidia saw demand for its chips from Communication Service Providers that have to provide AI systems for their customers. Since many CSPs are quite large –think Meta (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) — CSPs are likely to buy many of Nvidia’s chips at high prices in the coming quarters and years, to power their AI systems.
On the auto front, many of China’s electric vehicles are using Nvidia’s chips. With the sales of EVs surging in the Asian country, Nvidia’s revenue from automakers is poised to jump going forward. And in March, Nvidia reported that its “automotive design win pipeline [had] increased to $14 billion over the next six years.”
Vehicles’ utilization of chips is constantly increasing, and the sector is moving towards higher levels of autonomy, a phenomenon that requires many highly advanced chips.
Finally, with PC sales likely having bottomed last quarter, NVDA will probably get a meaningful bump from the rejuvenation of PC sales going forward.
The Bottom Line on NVDA Stock
In the short term, NVDA stock will probably sink due to the past weakness of the PC and crypto sectors, along with the negative impact of the debt ceiling standoff. Over the longer term, however, the shares should get a big boost from the AI and auto markets.
As a result, it makes sense for the long-term to buy NVDA stock on weakness in the coming weeks.

Share prices of the graphics card specialist have nearly doubled in 2023 despite warning signs from peers such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which are struggling due to weak personal computer (PC) and data center markets.
Both AMD and Intel's exposure to the PC market led to declines in their revenue and earnings last quarter.
AMD reported a 9% year-over-year decline in revenue and a much bigger drop of 47% in earnings per share.
Intel turned in a similarly woeful performance with a 36% year-over-year drop in revenue. Chipzilla also swung to an adjusted loss of $0.04 per share as compared to a profit of $0.87 per share in the year-ago period.
But these reports haven't played spoilsport for Nvidia stock despite the company's exposure to the PC market. The stock maintained its terrific momentum, which will be put to the test when the company releases its fiscal 2024 first-quarter results on May 24.
Nvidia needs to pass next week's litmus test to sustain its hot rally
Nvidia stock trades at a whopping 166 times trailing earnings thanks to its red-hot 2023 rally. For comparison, the Nasdaq-100 index sports an average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27. Nvidia, therefore, needs to deliver a solid set of results next week.
The good part is that Wall Street already priced a steep decline into Nvidia's revenue and earnings based on the guidance that the company issued in February 2023. Revenue is expected to drop 21% year over year to $6.5 billion, while earnings could contract 32% year over year to $0.92 per share.
There are signs that Nvidia could deliver better-than-expected results thanks to the massive demand for the company's artificial intelligence (AI) chips, which carry a massive price tag. However, a lot will hinge on Nvidia's outlook.
Consensus estimates point toward a turnaround in the company's fortunes in the current quarter. Its Q2 fiscal 2024 (ending July 31, 2023) revenue is expected to increase 6.5% year over year to $7.1 billion, while earnings are expected to more than double over the prior-year period to $1.06 per share. If Nvidia is unable to match -- or exceed -- these numbers, it won't be surprising to see investors pressing the panic button.
After all, the stock is extremely expensive right now, and Nvidia's recent quarterly performances don't justify that valuation. Investors have been bidding up the stock based on the hype around AI applications and how they are going to create terrific demand for Nvidia's chips. So if the company doesn't provide evidence that AI is moving the needle significantly and misses Wall Street's forecasts, the stock's outstanding rally could come to a grinding halt.
At the same time, investors shouldn't forget that a third of Nvidia's revenue comes from PC-centric businesses -- gaming and professional visualization. With PC sales declining at an alarming pace and a recovery still some time away, there is a chance of Nvidia's results and guidance not being up to analysts' expectations.
In simpler terms, the combination of Nvidia's steep valuation and headwinds in a substantial part of its business makes it a risky bet right now. So it might be too late for investors who have missed the rally so far to buy Nvidia.
But a potential trick up the company's sleeve could help it sustain its momentum.
AI spending could be Nvidia's trump card
Nvidia gets nearly 60% of its revenue from selling chips deployed in data centers. The sizable influence of the data center business on Nvidia's top line could help it overcome the PC market's weakness, especially considering that companies involved in the development of AI applications made a beeline for its chips.
Nvidia's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU), which is used for training large language models and powers generative AI applications such as chatbots, sells for as much as $40,000. This robust pricing power is the reason AI is expected to substantially boost Nvidia's growth in the coming years, potentially adding billions of dollars to the company's revenue.
The good part is that investors may witness the impact of AI-related demand on Nvidia's business very soon. DigiTimes reports that the semiconductor bellwether reportedly placed more orders for data center chips at foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC. It is also worth noting that the demand for TSMC's 5nm chips, on which Nvidia's data center GPUs are based, increased by a big margin last quarter.
A closer look at how AI-related spending is booming gives us more reasons to believe that demand for Nvidia's expensive AI chips could be high. Market research firm IDC estimates that spending on AI-centric systems could increase 27% this year and hit $154 billion. More importantly, this momentum is expected to continue long term. IDC expects AI spending to increase by 27% a year through 2026 and to exceed $300 billion a year.
Meanwhile, the AI chip market alone is expected to grow to a whopping $227 billion a year by 2032 from just $17 billion last year, according to Precedence Research. Nvidia is the leading player in this market, with an estimated share of 95% of the market for GPUs used for machine learning applications, according to New Street Research. So it won't be surprising to see AI turning out to be a long-term catalyst for the stock.
What should investors do?
Nvidia's valuation suggests that it might be too late to buy the stock now given the potential headwinds discussed above. But if the company turns in a solid set of results and starts growing once again thanks to AI, growth stock investors should consider grabbing it. That's because Nvidia's forward P/E ratio of 64, which is less than half its trailing earnings multiple, indicates that its bottom line is set for solid growth.
More specifically, Nvidia's earnings are expected to jump 37% this year to $4.58 per share. The momentum is expected to continue in the next fiscal year as well with an estimated jump of 33% to $6.11 per share.
The company's solid pricing power in AI chips and robust demand for those chips could help Nvidia deliver such impressive growth. So if Nvidia regains its mojo thanks to AI, the stock could continue heading higher, in which case there's still an opportunity for investors to ride along.

For the fiscal first quarter, the company expects revenues of $6.5 billion (+/-2%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $6.51 billion, indicating a 21.5% decline from the year-ago reported figure.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings is pegged at 92 cents per share. This suggests a year-over-year decline of 32.4%.
The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the preceding four quarters while missing the same on two occasions, the average surprise being -3.2%.
Let’s see how things have shaped up before the announcement.
NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
NVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote
Factors to Consider
NVIDIA’s first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the recovery across its Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets. The Gaming end market’s last quarter results had shown early signs of recovery as inventory with channel partners reached normal levels. The company also registered strong demand across most regions for its gaming products.
Revenues from the Gaming end market increased 16% sequentially in the last reported quarter. NVIDIA’s Professional Visualization segment performance also reflected recovery, with revenues increasing 13% sequentially. We believe that the trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter for both end markets.
Moreover, the continued strength of its Datacenter business on the growing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the growing hybrid working trend is expected to have boosted NVDA’s first-quarter revenues. An increase in Hyperscale demand and growing adoption in the inference market are likely to have been tailwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.
Further, the company’s Automotive segment showed an improvement in trends in five of the last seven quarters. The positive trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal first quarter, mainly due to increasing investments in self-driving and artificial intelligence cockpit solutions.
However, we opine that ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, like high inflation and interest rates, are likely to have continued to hurt the sales of NVIDIA’s desktop workstation GPUs in the first quarter. Additionally, disruptions in retail channel sales due to travel restrictions and social-distancing measures implemented across several parts of China might have weighed on the overall financial performance in the fiscal first quarter.

NVIDIA Declares $0.04 Dividend
On February 22, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share ($0.16 annualized). Shareholders of record as of March 8, 2023 received the payment on March 29, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.04 per share.
At the current share price of $312.64 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.05%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.19%, the lowest has been 0.02%, and the highest has been 0.50%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.12 (n=237).
The current dividend yield is 1.10 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.09. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

2023-05-23 00:00:00+00:00,Bulls vs. Bears - Who Will Emerge Victorious?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bulls-vs.-bears-who-will-emerge-victorious,"Currently, the stock market is at an interesting crossroads. As investors patiently wait for the outcome of the debt ceiling negotiations from Washington, the U.S. Federal Reserve Meeting Wednesday, and the fallout from the banking crisis, there is a lot to digest. To make matters more confusing, the different equity indexes are diverging from each other in the widest margin seen in years. For example, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index ETF (QQQ) is higher by an impressive 26% year-to-date while the Russell 2000 Index ETF (IWM) is higher by a measly 1% (albeit it’s had to deal with a regional banking crisis).
From an investor perspective it can seem like a daunting task to try to account for and factor into a strategy monetary policy changes, macro-economic factors, political negotiations, geopolitics, and more. I have found that the best way to overcome this confusion is to factor in historical stats, precedent, and above all, listen to what the price and volume action is telling us. With that in mind, I will break down the bear and bull case for the stock market at this point in time.
Bear Case:
Bearish Divergence: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures the momentum of a particular instrument.Presently,The RSI of the S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) is showing a bearish divergence. Bearish divergences occur when the price of an asset makes new highs while momentum does not – an indication that momentum may be lagging.

“Sell the News” Potential: Wall Street tends to be a discounting device – it prices in highly anticipated events ahead of time. Is the recent melt up in stocks an indication that a resolution is likely to be found for the current debt ceiling negotiations? If so, savvy investors may use the burst of enthusiasm to take some profits. In October of 2022, stocks did the exact opposite and bought the news after the highly anticipated “highest in 40 years” inflation data hit news wires. Consequently, the S&P 500 had a bullish divergence at the time.

Pictured: RSI divergences can be key inflection points.
QQQ Distance from the 50-day Moving Average: Moving averages can be a valuable tool for investors because it can provide a reference point for trends. Uptrends tend to take two steps higher and one step lower, or three steps higher and two steps back. For investors, the best course of action is to avoid chasing trends and instead look to buy into support. Historically, when an index gets extended by 7% or more above the 50-day moving average it needs to correct – either through time or price. Late last week the QQQ index reached extended levels of 7% above the 50-day moving average.

Sentiment: The CNN Fear and Greed Index measures sentiment through seven fear and greed indicators. The index is currently flashing the “greediest” levels since February – just before the market endured a multi-week correction.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Bull Case:
Trends Tend to Persist: As Larry Hite once said, “the trend is your friend until the end when it bends”. Presently, QQQ and SPY are in classic uptrends. Price is above a rising 200-day moving average, the moving averages are stacked (faster moving averages above slower ones), and they are making higher highs and lower lows. Rarely does it pay to fight the predominant trend for more than a short-term trade.

Innovation to Drive Future Earnings and Cut Costs: Many value investors are complaining about big tech valuations in companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) (trades at 34x) and Nvidia (NVDA) (94x). Though the valuations are undoubtedly lofty, using P/E as a timing device is a fool’s errand – especially in bull markets. Firstly, the internet bubble and many bull markets over the years provide investors with proof that p/e ratio can extend to nosebleed levels and stay there for months or years before a stock tops.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Secondly, the AI revolution may boost earnings to a point where innovative companies like NVDA can “grow into them”. Even with this year’s monstrous move in stocks like Alphabet (GOOGL), MSFT, and NVDA, context is important. After the 2022 tech correction, all three stocks remain well below their highs, while growth is expected to catapult higher. For example, NVDA (which reports earnings Wednesday) is expected to announce record earnings in early 2024. Meanwhile, the share price is well below the all-time high price of $346 achieved in late 2021.

History Tells Us that Price Bottoms Well Before Earnings: The past three major bear markets (2020 Covid Crash, 2008 Global Financial Crisis, & 2000 Internet Bubble) saw price bottom before earnings. Will it happen once again?

Stabilization Outside of Tech: A key argument in many bearish theses is that mega-cap tech stocks such as Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are propping up the entire equity market.
Potential for Broader Participation: Monday, IWM shot higher by 1.22%, outperforming the other major indices. Beaten down ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) leapt higher by nearly 5%. Troubled auto retailed Carvana (CVNA) has more than doubled off lows. All the above point to evidence that weaker areas of the market may be finally stabilizing.
Putting it All Together
The bull and bear arguments laid out above suggest that the uptrend may need to pause and correct through time or price in the short-term. While there is little evidence to go short, new longs should be avoided until we get a pullback. Longer term, the evidence points to a bull market recovery.

NVIDIA Declares $0.04 Dividend
On May 24, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share ($0.16 annualized). Shareholders of record as of June 8, 2023 will receive the payment on June 30, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.04 per share.
At the current share price of $379.80 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.04%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.19%, the lowest has been 0.02%, and the highest has been 0.50%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.12 (n=237).
The current dividend yield is 1.17 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.09. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

2023-05-30 00:00:00+00:00,Did Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) Miss the Most Disruptive Innovation of All?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/did-cathie-woods-ark-innovation-etf-arkk-miss-the-most-disruptive-innovation-of-all,"Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation Fund (NYSEARCA:ARKK) bills itself as investing in “disruptive innovation.” Unfortunately for ARKK ETF holders, it seems that ARKK missed out on at least the early stages of the rise of the most innovative and disruptive technological advance in recent times -- artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI, in particular. 
Why Generative AI Should be in a Disruptive Innovation Fund
It’s hard to argue that the rise of AI, and specifically generative AI, isn’t the most disruptive technological breakthrough that we’ve witnessed in some time. For those unfamiliar with the term, Roundhill Investments defines generative AI as “artificial intelligence models capable of creating new, unique content (i.e., images, text, audio) by learning patterns and structures from existing data.”
Consumer-facing generative AI apps like OpenAI's ChatGPT have gone viral and reached critical mass at an unprecedented rate. After launching in November 2022, ChatGPT hit 100 million users a mere two months later, becoming the fastest-growing application of all time.  
And it’s not just ChatGPT -- investors and the public alike have been amazed by OpenAI’s Dall-E software, which can create elaborate images from text-based prompts. Recently, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) unveiled its new Firefly generative AI engine, which enables users to edit images in Photoshop using just a text-based prompt.
While the average investor can’t invest in privately-held OpenAI, there are plenty of ways for investors to gain exposure to this type of innovation. For example, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) owns a large stake in OpenAI. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has its own answer to ChatGPT called Bard.
The aforementioned Adobe is also publicly traded. Meanwhile, ChatGPT and other generative AI applications are powered by Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) semiconductors. Unfortunately, none of these names are found in the ARK Innovation ETF. 
Conspicuous in Their Absence
ARKK stock is up nearly 30% year-to-date, so it’s hard to criticize its performance so far in 2023. However, the leaders in generative AI mentioned above are glaring in their omission from a fund that is focused on innovative and disruptive technology, and many of these names are up even more than ARKK.
Nvidia is up roughly 180% year-to-date, far more than ARKK. Last week, Nvidia reported blowout earnings and released show-stopping guidance for the current quarter, and the stock gained ~24% on the day, tacking on $184 billion to its market cap. To put things into perspective, Nvidia essentially added more than the entire market cap of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or Nike (NYSE:NKE) to its valuation in a single day.
As mentioned above, Nvidia is not owned by ARKK. Making matters worse for ARKK holders is the fact that ARKK had the prescience to own Nvidia long before it became the hottest name in the market. ARKK exited its Nvidia position over the course of last November to this January, missing out on the bulk of its massive year-to-date run. 
In fairness to ARK Invest, the firm does own Nvidia in smaller funds like the ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ) and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW), but there’s no way around the fact that they missed out on a massive gain in its flagship fund. 
A Matter of Valuation?
In an interview with CNBC this past February, Cathie Wood said that the fund sold Nvidia as part of the process of “consolidating around their highest-conviction names” and that part of the reason that Nvidia didn’t make the cut was that its valuation is very high. Wood isn’t wrong about this valuation per se -- after its monster earnings report, Nvidia now trades at a nosebleed 50 times forward earnings and 40 times consensus 2025 earnings. 
It’s not a bad thing to take profits from some of your winners and consolidate them into your new best ideas, but unfortunately, the timing of this move didn’t work out in ARK’s favor. Furthermore, selling Nvidia based on its valuation makes some sense, although when looking at ARKK’s other top holdings, it doesn’t appear that valuation is a primary concern. 
Below is an overview of ARKK's top 10 holdings. Click on the image to learn more.
As you can see, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the fund’s top holding, with a large weighting of nearly 11%. Wood is a longtime and prominent Tesla bull, and this pick has been a big winner for ARKK, as Tesla has returned 86% year-to-date, driving a large part of ARKK's overall gain. However, Tesla also trades at an expensive P/E multiple of 55 and a forward P/E of 39 times. While this is slightly cheaper than Nvidia, they are still clearly in the same ballpark, and both trade at valuations well above the broader market. 
Meanwhile, other top-five holdings like Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) and Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) are not yet profitable.  
ARKK does own another AI play, UiPath (NYSE:PATH), in its top 10 holdings. UiPath specializes in workflow automation and trades at 46 times forward earnings and 41 times 2025 consensus earnings. So, again, it's another example of a holding where the valuation is not all that different from Nvidia’s.
Top 10 holding Crispr (NASDAQ:CRSP), focused on gene editing technology, is not yet profitable but trades at 50 times sales (a premium to Nvidia’s price-to-sales multiple of 36). 
As touched on above, Nvidia isn’t the only name involved in generative AI that is missing from ARKK’s portfolio. The fund doesn’t hold any semiconductor names, and to put it simply, analysts from Susquehanna recently called semiconductors the ""picks and shovels"" of the AI gold rush. None of the mega-cap tech names like Microsoft, Alphabet, or Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which are all pushing their own advances in AI technology, are present. Software names like Adobe or Hubspot (NYSE:HUBS), which are integrating AI into their platforms, aren't present either.
Within enterprise software, however, in addition to UiPath, the fund has been buying Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), another stock that has benefited from surging investor interest in AI.
Further, the smaller ARK Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF holds a 4.4% position in Nvidia. It takes a bit of a different approach to artificial intelligence and owns many industrial names that are incorporating robotics and AI technology into their products ranging from agriculture and construction machinery giants like Deere (NYSE:DE) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) to defense companies like Kratos (NASDAQ:KTOS) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). As well, the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF has a 1.6% position in Nvidia, as well as small positions in Microsoft and Palantir.
Is ARKK Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
According to the collective ratings of 398 analysts, ARKK comes in as a Hold. 49.75% of ratings are Buys, 40.45% are Holds, and 9.8% are Sells. The average ARKK stock price target of $49.81 implies 25.1% upside potential.
Looking Ahead
In summary, Cathie Wood and ARKK Invest certainly deserve credit for a strong rebound of nearly 30% so far in 2023. Still, you can’t help but feel that they missed out on perhaps the most ""disruptive innovation"" of all by selling Nvidia just before ChatGPT took generative AI mainstream.
Further, the fund doesn't have much other exposure to the other pioneers in the space, whether it’s other semiconductor companies or tech mega caps that have emerged as the early leaders in the AI revolution. At this point in time, based on its current holdings, it has to be said that ARKK doesn’t look well-positioned to truly capture the upside of the next era of revolutionary technological innovation.

2023-05-31 00:00:00+00:00,US STOCKS-Wall St falls as labor data spurs rate hike jitters before debt ceiling vote,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-st-falls-as-labor-data-spurs-rate-hike-jitters-before-debt-ceiling-vote-0,"By Herbert Lash and Shreyashi Sanyal
May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday as a deal to raise the federal debt ceiling headed toward a crucial vote in Congress, while unexpectedly strong labor market data rattled investors who fear the Federal Reserve might hike interest rates again in June.
The House of Representatives is expected to vote in the evening on a bill to lift the $31.4 trillion debt limit, a critical step to avoid a destabilizing default that could come early next week without congressional approval.
House passage would send the bill to the Senate, where debate could stretch to the weekend, just before the June 5 date when the government could start to run out of money.
But most analysts foresee the bill's approval and U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he expected the debt ceiling bill on his desk by next Monday.
""The bond market liked that there was some fiscal discipline and the equity market liked that it's not going to hurt growth,"" said Brad Conger, deputy chief investment officer at Hirtle Callaghan & Co in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.
""I don't think we could have asked for a better outcome.""
However, equity valuations are stretched considering interest rates are high, the economy is slowing and inflation needs to decline further, Conger said.
""Quite frankly, if we're really slowing down, the market is not offering a free lunch,"" he said. ""It's going to be a struggle if inflation is not perceived to be ebbing, which is where we are.""
The Labor Department reportedthat U.S. job openings unexpectedly rose in April, pointing to persistent strength in a labor market that suggests pressure on both wages and inflation.
Futures traders raised to 70% the probability of a 25 basis points hike at the Fed's June 13-14 policy meeting. But that likelihood fell to about 32% after comments by Fed officials who are leaning to what some call a ""hawkish pause."" FEDWATCH
Fed Governor and vice chair nominee Philip Jefferson said skipping a rate hike in two weeks would provide policymakers time to see more data before making a decision. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker also said on Wednesday that for now he is inclined to support a ""skip"" in rate hikes.
""The recent economic data has not really favored a pause in rate hikes,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""But we've had a number of Fed governors coming out this afternoon and saying a pause is either likely or certainly possible.""
The Labor Department's closely watched May unemployment report, due on Friday, could decide whether a rate hike occurs.
The major indices pared some losses after the comments by Fed officials.

The Nasdaq, propelled partially by optimism about artificial intelligence (AI), is already in a bull market, as the index had soared 25% so far this year. The S&P 500, which is on the verge of a bull market as well, has also benefitted from investor enthusiasm related to the technology. So, today, we’re going to look at the best stocks for an AI-powered market.
Rather than chase stocks with sky-high valuations, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and C3.ai (NYSE:AI), the best AI stocks to buy for a bull market are top-notch names that the Street has not yet or just recently started to embrace.
So, without further ado, here are the top stocks for an AI bull market.
Intel (INTC)

While some chipmakers such as Nvidia have run up sharply on the promise of AI, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has largely been left behind. However, recent comments by Nvidia Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang suggest that Intel may become a key Nvidia partner and benefit greatly from Nvidia’s prowess in AI.
“We’re open to manufacturing with Intel… and we’ve recently received the test chip results of [Intel’s] next generation process, and the results look good,” Huang said.
Intel is focused on expanding its manufacturing capacity. To this end, the company is building two chip factories in Arizona. In addition, the company began construction on a $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing site in Ohio in September.
Meanwhile, as I’ve reported previously, the company’s Gaudi chips look poised to enable a great deal of generative AI, boosting revenue and profits from data centers over the long term.
“We’re seeing a very positive response to Gaudi 2 and seeing our pipeline growing very rapidly for that product line,” said Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger on the company’s Q1earnings callin April.
Based on analysts’ average 2024 earnings estimate, INTC stock is trading at a price-earnings ratio of 17.8 compared with 38.4 for NVDA.
Lemonade (LMND)

Lemonade (NASDAQ:LMND) is an insurance company that extensively utilizes AI to price its offerings and interact with its customers. In a recent letter to its shareholders, the insurer reported that it had identified “100 business processes that generative AI can automate and
improve,” predicting these changes will significantly reduce its costs over the longer term.
The company’s strategy of using AI to make itself more attractive to millennials appears to be paying off. In the first quarter, revenue soared an incredible 115% year over year to $95.2 million, while adjusted EBITDA saw an 11% improvement. In-force premiums increased 56% from a year ago to more than $653 million. And its customer count climbed 23% versus the same period a year earlier to 1.86 million.
Finally, as Seeking Alpha’s Gary Alexander points out, the company is poised to benefit from interest rate increases and cross-selling opportunities.
LMND stock is changing hands for a reasonable 2.7 times 2024 sales estimates.
Medtronic (MDT)

Medical device maker Medtronic (NASDAQ:MDT) is utilizing AI in multiple aspects of its business. For example, the company is using the technology to predict outcomes for spinal surgeries,  identify pre-cancerous tissue and determine the amount of insulin that diabetic patients require.
And, as I’ve noted in previous columns, Medtronic has launched “a robot that helps perform surgeries” using artificial intelligence. Speaking to an analyst earlier this year, CFO Karen Parkhill said the robot is “going to be a strong contributor to our revenue growth for many years to come.”
Investment bank Bernstein recently expressed optimism about Medtronic’s chances of reporting strong results next year, and it maintained an “outperform” rating on the stock.
Shares currently trade with a forward price-earnings ratio of 15.4, but this discount may not last long.

We’ve have been under the threat of recession for more than a year. We’ve also been dealing with stubbornly high inflation along the way. And unfortunately, Americans are strained. However, there’s still opportunity to be found in some of the best stocks for non-recession recession.
NVDA Nvidia $391.71
GOOG GOOGL Alphabet $126.63
PM Philip Morris $90.05
DE Deere $363.65
BF-B Brown-Forman $63.08
AXP American Express $167.43
DG Dollar General $158.87
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: shutterstock.com/CC7
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the clearest choice among stocks to buy if we don’t experience a major downturn. The firm once famous for GPUs and more recently known for AI has taken off in 2023. 
By now, it’s old news that Nvidia is the best AI stock of 2023. Even prior to Q1 earnings NVDA shares more than doubled, moving from $124 to $305. Then, on May 24 the company released earnings that included guidance that blew previous expectations out of the water. Sales for Q2 are now forecast to reach $11 billion, well ahead of the $ 7.2 billion Wall Street had been expecting. That news skyrocketed prices to near $400 where they now sit. 
Investors have grown shaky at Nvidia’s valuations following the upswing. But Nvidia has cornered the market for AI chipsets and supplies a market no other firm can. These are Wild West days for Nvidia and AI but I’d bet against NVDA slipping, absent a recession. 
Google (GOOG,GOOGL) 
Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.com
Google (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) is my other AI stock pick at the moment. Why? Because it has more upside in relation to AI than its primary competitor, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While Microsoft has received a lot of positive attention related to AI thus far, Google has not. 
Google didn’t make a massive investment into OpenAI and ChatGPT. Microsoft did. So, round one clearly went to Microsoft. But Google has made up ground, recently releasing AI tools publicly. The balance of attention is shifting in its favor. Investors have a reasonably good idea of Microsoft’s AI positioning. They’re just beginning to understand where Google is positioned. 
That places Google in an enviable position in the coming months. If it shows promise in relation to AI investors should expect it to appreciate quickly. Google is also leaning out operationally which promises to boost its value. All of this threatens white-collar workers within and without the company, sure. But it stands to benefit Google investors. 
Phillip Morris (PM)
Source: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com
I’d argue that Phillip Morris (NYSE:PM) is one of the best stocks to invest in right now. That assertion holds true whether a clear recession emerges or not. PM shares offer value in both instances. 
Phillip Morris manufactures and sells cigarettes although it is pivoting toward a smoke-free business model. The point here is that cigarette companies have historically been one of the most inflation-resistant industries. People smoke when the economy is strong and when it isn’t they smoke more. During the last recession in 2008 tobacco firms boomed. In short, that gives reason to believe that a similar trend could emerge again.
And if no recession occurs Phillip Morris remains a strong investment. It currently offers a dividend yielding 5.6% and an average target stock price above $112. It trades at $90. That means that with dividends included PM shares have 29% upside. Investing is therefore arguably a win-win situation. 
Deere (DE)
Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com
Deere (NYSE:DE) stock continues to confound investors. Most signs suggest it should be flying high. However, it continues to trend downward. Sales increased by 34% to end the company’s second quarter and net income increased from $2.098 billion to $2.86 billion. Deere is a fundamentally sound firm to be sure. Agricultural equipment operating profits doubled to $2.2 billion year-over-year. In its construction business that same metric grew from $814 million to $834 million.  Yet share prices are falling. Some analysts attribute declining prices to fear that things can’t get better for the company. Others continue to worry about a recession. 
I believe DE stock is simply a bargain right now. Its P/E ratio is nearing a decade low and currently stands below 12. DE stock has a lot of upside built into share prices. The company is positioned to benefit from an infrastructure buildout and any push to increase U.S. agriculture. Further, worldwide sales increased by 30% this quarter so Deere is relatively insulated.
Brown-Forman (BF-B)
Source: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.com
Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF-B) is an alcohol stock that should do well in a variety of situations. The company sells liquor, wine, and ready-to-drink cocktails. Like Phillip Morris, Brown-Forman can be classified as sin stocks which generally are recession resistant. 
And Brown-Forman is doing quite well currently in the non-recession. The company’s top line is growing albeit somewhat slowly. That said, its ready-to-drink category is clearly a strength with 12% growth fueled by Jack Daniels mixed drinks. And bourbons including Woodford Reserve are growing at a much faster pace. 
Overall, Brown-Forman is not an exciting stock nor should investors expect it to provide rapid gains. It’s more of a capital preservation stock with decent upside in good times. Investors get a dividend that doesn’t yield much at 1.33% but one that also hasn’t been reduced since 1985. It’s a hedge against the worst that provides modest upside if the worst doesn’t materialize. 
American Express (AXP)

Investors looking to take advantage of record credit card debt should consider American Express (NYSE:AXP) first. It has obvious benefits as credit card debt reaches historic highs while also benefiting from its premium status. 
U.S. credit card debt is at all-time highs and is currently approaching $1 trillion. The average credit card interest rate is also at the highest levels on record. It doesn’t take much to understand how credit card companies like American Express stand to benefit from the current situation. That argument applies to all other credit card stocks too, though. So why should investors choose American Express over other firms?
The answer lies in its higher-income customer base. They are spending on travel and other services and goods that lower-income credit card users might pull back on. Further, they’re lower risk overall and tend to carry better creditworthiness. That shields American Express relative to other credit card stocks as its top-line results continue to grow. 
Dollar General (DG) 
Source: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.com
Dollar General (NYSE:DG) stock was the go-to retail investment during 2022 for the idea that an impending recession would gut purchasing power. The company did see strong growth as shoppers sought discounts. 
But 2023 has been different and Dollar General is facing a new set of problems as lower-income households are getting hit. Lower tax refunds are hurting Dollar General’s core customers. Theft, too, has been a real issue for the retailer. 
The result is that management now expects growth to be flat at best through the year and as low as -8%. Previous estimates pegged growth between 4-6%. But look at it differently and an opportunity emerges. Dollar General is suffering from negative expectations. It simply has to find any growth at all over the next 6-7 months and it will appreciate. Prices fell from $200 to $160 because of the news. It’s arguably an overcorrection that investors should seize.

2023-06-06 00:00:00+00:00,3 AI Chip Stocks Much Cheaper Than Nvidia,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-ai-chip-stocks-much-cheaper-than-nvidia,"There has been a lot of talk about artificial intelligence and the impact it will have on humanity and the economy ever since the release of ChatGPT last November. But that enthusiasm began to translate into eye-opening financial results with Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) blowout guidance on May 24 -- roughly six months later.
Nvidia's guidance seemed to validate the recent bullishness for semiconductors and cloud platforms generally, propelling many such stocks significantly higher. However, for some, Nvidia may now look at tad pricey, at over 200 times earnings and 35 times sales.

Fortunately, there are other data center-oriented chip stocks that will benefit handsomely from the AI trend, and they come at a cheaper valuation -- like the following three stocks.
Broadcom and Marvell
I group these two companies together because they have some overlap in terms of the products they offer, including Ethernet switching, optical component interfaces, storage controllers, and customized application-specific integrated chips (ASICs).
All of these chips will be essential in building out next-generation data centers geared for AI applications. On the company's recent conference call with analysts, Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) CEO Matt Murphy said:
... [L]eading cloud data centers connect thousands of these systems in a single cluster to provide maximum scalability for their customers, with each of these systems capable of driving tens of terabits of network traffic... And in order to create the largest possible cluster sizes at data center scale, these connections need to be able to operate over increasingly long distances. These clusters require a staggering amount of high-bandwidth connectivity, all of which needs to be provided at ultra-low latency and high reliability and within a reasonable power envelope.
In other words, along with GPU-based computing systems, networking and switching requirements are also about to skyrocket, which will play into the hands of Marvell's PAM4 digital signal processing (DSP) interfaces, data center interconnect, and Teralynx 10 Ethernet switching platforms.
Meanwhile, Broadcom's (NASDAQ: AVGO) current open architecture Tomahawk and Jericho chips for merchant switching and routing, currently deployed in data centers and telecom platforms, can be easily adapted and used for the intense networking needs of AI data centers.
In addition to these routing, switching, and optical interconnect platforms, both companies also compete in the arena of custom ASICs, which many large cloud companies are using with their custom-designed AI accelerators. JPMorgan Chase analyst Harlan Sur believes this will be a fast-growing market, with Broadcom having a leading 35% share, and Marvell having roughly 15% ASIC share. Yet, Sur sees both as poised to benefit from custom AI design wins in the years ahead.
Overall, both companies recently stated they see their AI-related revenue doubling this year, with another doubling next year. Broadcom notes AI-related products represent about 15% of its semiconductor business today, but remember, Broadcom also has a software segment that accounts for about 22% of revenues, so AI chips account for a little less than that 15% overall.
Meanwhile, for Marvell, AI-related products only accounted for $200 million of revenue last year out of $5.9 billion in revenue, or about 3.3%; however, Marvell obviously sees very strong growth here. Moreover, management isn't accounting for the knock-on benefits for its large storage control portfolio in its AI growth projections, which should benefit from increased data usage. Thus, the doubling in 2023 and 2024 AI revenue could understate the effect of AI on Marvell's business.
Broadcom is the more mature and profitable company, trading at just 18 times forward earnings with a dividend of 2.3%. Meanwhile, Marvell is smaller, at just a $51.8 billion market cap to Broadcom's $338 billion. Marvell isn't currently profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but is free cash flow profitable, due to high stock-based compensation.
The stock trades at 40 times this year's earnings expectations, and about 25 times 2025 analyst estimates, as analysts expect profitability to inflect upwards.
And don't sleep on Microchip
Meanwhile, Microchip Technology (NASDAQ: MCHP) also isn't the first chip stock many think about when they mention AI. This could be due to the company's microcontroller and analog focus, which are very diverse businesses beyond data center infrastructure.
However, Microchip's solutions are important to the data center, and management has identified the data center as one of six big megatrends it cited and attacked as part of its Microchip 3.0 strategy launched two years ago. In fact, Microchip's data center segment is the largest of the six megatrends cited, at 17.5% of sales, up from 14.2% just two years ago. Overall, Microchip's high-growth megatrend segments have grown from 34% to 45% of the business in just two years, growing at two times the rate of the overall company.
While not every Microchip data center product plays a role in AI, many do, including its PCIe switches, which connect servers and individual chips to each other as opposed to whole-rack systems like Ethernet does. Other AI-related products include smart memory interfaces, data center interconnect Ethernet products, power and silicon carbide chips, and others. All should benefit from increasing compute intensity, and Microchip's focus on sustainability and electrification should help mitigate the heat generated by massive AI clusters going forward, too.
Microchip is the cheapest of the three stocks, trading at just 11.5 this year's earnings estimates. While its AI impact may be more muted than the other two, Microchip's low valuation and increasing cash returns give it a lower hurdle to clear. Meanwhile, the rest of its portfolio is geared heavily toward industrial, IoT, and automotive chips, which should also have resilient growth as the electrification and automation trends sustain through this decade.

2023-06-07 00:00:00+00:00,Macroeconomic Headwinds Take a Toll on Semiconductor Sales,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/macroeconomic-headwinds-take-a-toll-on-semiconductor-sales,"According to the latest report by Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA),  global semiconductor industry sales were $40 billion in April, reflecting a monthly increase of 0.3% but a 21.6% decline from $50.9 billion in the year-ago period.
SIA president and CEO, John Neuffer cited cyclical downturns and sluggish macroeconomic conditions being the reasons behind the year-over-year decline. He also stated that “the month-to-month sales ticked up for the second consecutive month in April, perhaps foreshadowing a continued rebound in the months ahead.”
Despite modest month-to-month growth, the semiconductor industry continues to get negatively impacted by interrelated issues like rising prices, geopolitical tensions and pandemic aftereffects. These elements influence consumer spending, and result in macroeconomic uncertainty and swings in semiconductor demand. Also, currency fluctuations and fears of global recession continue to unfavorably impact the industry.
Nonetheless, the long-term prospects remain strong for the industry as semiconductors are the backbone of the current-day technology-driven economy. Digitization across industries, the adoption of cloud computing, and the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning are likely to fuel demand for semiconductors.

The accelerated deployment of 5G technology — the next-generation wireless revolution — is likely to propel further growth. Apart from this, blockchain, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality/virtual reality and wearables are other growth prospects.

In May, the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) projected global annual semiconductor sales to decline from $574.1 billion in 2022 to $515.1 billion in 2023. However, the same is expected to rebound strongly in 2024 and reach $576.0 billion, which would be the market’s highest ever. The semiconductor market registered growth of 3.3% to reach an all-time high in 2022 from $555.9 billion in 2021, according to a report released by SIA on Mar 27, 2023. Owing to robust demand, 2022 has so far been one of the best years for the market.

Considering the long-term bright prospects of the industry, it is wise to stay invested in semiconductor stocks like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Nova Limited NVMI, Allegro MicroSystems ALGM and Photronics PLAB. All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and have witnessed positive estimate revisions. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

2023-06-08 00:00:00+00:00,AI Could Send These 2 Nasdaq Stocks to the Moon,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ai-could-send-these-2-nasdaq-stocks-to-the-moon,"The stock market moved sharply higher on Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) picking up more than 1% shortly after noon. Despite lingering concerns about the state of the economy and the likely response of policymakers toward interest rates, investors appeared ready to declare an end to the bear market and get themselves squarely back into a bullish mood.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a key trend lifting markets, and there are plenty of AI stocks in the Nasdaq. Two companies in particular have made AI a big part of their future business models, and on Thursday, both Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) made sizable gains that further added to the furor surrounding the trend.
Adobe releases AI tools
Shares of Adobe were up 5% early Thursday afternoon. The creative software specialist is aiming to be at the forefront of the AI revolution as it pertains to content creation, and it announced a host of new innovations to help its clients get more from artificial intelligence.
Adobe's conference for the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region kicked off in London on Thursday, and the company released a lot of news. Adobe said that it would offer its Firefly generative AI package as part of its Adobe Express all-in-one app, in the hopes of making AI a more integral part of content creation more broadly. A new content supply chain solution will also incorporate generative AI capabilities and help brands with high-volume needs to be as efficient as possible while keeping overall costs down. And on the marketing side, the Sensei GenAI service will help marketing teams and other clients focused on customer experience keep productivity high.
Adobe stock also benefited from numerous increases in price targets from analysts that responded favorably to the news. Former price targets in the $415-$430 range got boosted to between $460 and $500, with many analysts pointing directly at the company's attempts to incorporate generative AI capabilities as a key driver of longer-term growth.
There's no doubt that many industries will face disruption from the rise of artificial intelligence, but the ability to create content prolifically is among the most obvious. That puts Adobe in a great position to be a first-adopter in embracing AI as part of its business model, and shareholders like that idea a lot right now.
Nvidia invests more in AI
Shares of Nvidia were up more than 3%, adding to its amazing run during 2023. The semiconductor giant has made a name for itself by fueling AI innovation across the tech industry, but it's also putting money to work to help other companies put artificial intelligence to the test.
Privately held AI foundation model specialist Cohere announced a successful funding round. Cohere raised $270 million, with Nvidia among those helping to back the round.
The news is important because Cohere is trying to offer an alternative to OpenAI, which Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has embraced as its core AI partnership. Large companies like Nvidia don't necessarily want to lock themselves into a Microsoft-defined framework to take advantage of opportunities in the AI space, especially this early in its development.
Some have argued that Nvidia stock has come too far, too quickly, as it has repeatedly flirted with the $1 trillion market capitalization mark. If AI turns out to be as big as many believe, though, then Nvidia could still have a lot further to go in the years ahead.

2023-06-09 00:00:00+00:00,These 2 Nasdaq Stocks Hit All-Time Record Highs Friday,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-2-nasdaq-stocks-hit-all-time-record-highs-friday,"The major indexes climbed higher again on Friday, and even though many media outlets paid close attention to the S&P 500 having climbed 20% from its bear market lows, the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) had already recovered much more of its lost ground since last October. Friday morning's gains of about 1% for the Nasdaq showed continuing optimism about the stock market's resilience even in the face of macroeconomic challenges.
Indeed, the mood was so good that some Nasdaq equities hit all-time highs. Investors have gravitated toward artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, and both ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ: ON) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) have hitched their wagons to the AI trend. Here's why investors are excited about both companies.
Making cars smarter
Shares of ON Semiconductor were up more than 1% in early trading. The semiconductor manufacturer has concentrated much of its attention on the automotive market, particularly the efforts of auto manufacturers to produce autonomous driving systems.
ON Semi's chips and components are geared toward multiple facets of autonomous driving. Whether you're looking for parking assistance capabilities, lane departure warnings, collision avoidance systems, advanced braking, or simple cameras that give drivers more awareness of their surroundings, ON Semi's memory chips, analog switches, microcontrollers, and sensors have become must-have items for aspiring automakers. Moreover, ON Semi has also benefited from other automotive trends, including infotainment offerings, power management systems, and in-vehicle networking.
Beyond autonomous driving, ON Semi is also poised to benefit from the trend toward EV adoption. Its power systems know-how could help the company provide better solutions over time for EV charging. Given the challenge that range anxiety represents to potential EV buyers, a solution from ON Semi could change the industry.
Best of all, unlike many tech companies, ON Semi is currently profitable and even trades at a reasonable multiple of about 20 times next year's estimated earnings. That suggests that even at a record stock price, ON Semi could still rise further.
Super Micro looks like a super stock
Meanwhile, shares of Super Micro Computer jumped another 5% Friday morning. That brought its year-to-date gain to more than 200% as more investors become aware of the hardware company and its potential relevance in an AI-driven market.
Super Micro has gotten on investors' radar as a result of its association with key players in the AI space. Its business centers on server and data storage system technology, and it is aiming to innovate in all the hottest growth areas, including cloud computing, enterprise transformation, AI, 5G infrastructure, and the metaverse. It has close partnerships with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), whose success has led some investors to see Super Micro as a follow-on play.
Some have criticized Super Micro's move higher as AI-based hype, especially since hardware-centric businesses generally haven't found long-term success. However, given its massive growth in profits, the stock still trades at reasonable multiples, and many see plenty more room for expansion in the immediate future.
Investors have had to deal with bear-market conditions for a long time. If they see the opportunity for a broad-based rebound, they're apt to take it -- and that could help stocks that are already hitting new all-time highs gain even more ground in the months and years to come.

2023-06-12 00:00:00+00:00,This Simple but Effective Fund is 2023’s Most Popular ETF,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-simple-but-effective-fund-is-2023s-most-popular-etf,"One ETF has taken in more money than all others so far in 2023, with a massive $11.3 billion in inflows as of June 6th, according to FactSet. But it’s not a hot new AI fund or an ETF capitalizing on other en-vogue tech trends, although it will give you some exposure to them. Instead, it’s arguably one of the most boring, vanilla ETFs out there, but this doesn’t mean it can’t help you to grow your portfolio. It’s the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO). In fact, whether you are just beginning your investing journey or if you are already a veteran trader who has spent years in the investing game, this unassuming but massive ETF can serve as a sound building block for your portfolio. Here’s why. 
Harness the Power of the Entire S&P 500 in Your Portfolio 
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF boasts over $300 billion in assets under management (AUM), making it the third-largest ETF in the market today. While there are many complex investing strategies and products out there that claim to offer investors a leg up on the market, VOO keeps it simple. It invests in the S&P 500 (SPX), the index that consists of about 500 of the largest 500 U.S. stocks and arguably the most important and influential index in the investing world.
The S&P 500 covers all sectors of the U.S. economy, so rather than having to bet on individual sectors, an ETF like VOO gives you exposure to them all -- from tech leaders like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to old economy industrial giants like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Deere (NYSE:DE) and everything in between.
The great thing about VOO is that it allows investors to harness the power and innovation of a large swath of the U.S. economy in one investment vehicle without having to pick favorite sectors or stocks. An investment in VOO is essentially a bet on around 500 of the top publicly-listed companies in the United States continuing to innovate and profit over time, which has historically been a winning proposition. 
Below, you’ll find an overview of VOO’s top 10 holdings, created using TipRanks' holdings tool.
Because it tracks the S&P 500 index itself, the fund is extraordinarily diversified, holding 504 stocks, and its top 10 positions make up just 27.8% of assets. As you can see, top holding Apple accounts for a 7.2% position in the fund, followed by Microsoft, which has a 6.6% weighting, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Alphabet (Class A) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rounding out the top five holdings. However, it’s not just tech stocks, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) and energy giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) follow closely behind. 
As you can see in the table, VOO's top holdings feature a pretty solid collection of Smart Scores. In fact, four of its top 10 holdings, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), feature 'Perfect 10' Smart Scores. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating, and VOO itself has a strong ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10.
Is VOO Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
So the quantitative factors rate VOO favorably, but what do Wall Street analysts think? VOO earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TipRanks based on analysts' ratings, and the average VOO stock price target of $445.50 implies upside potential of 11.9%. Of the 6,212 analyst ratings on the name, 59.13% are Buys, 35.33% are Holds, and just 5.54% are Sells.
Investor-Friendly Fees       
In addition to this ample diversification and broad exposure, another attractive feature of VOO is its low expense ratio. It’s hard to beat VOO’s minuscule expense ratio of just 0.03%. An investor putting $10,000 into VOO would pay just $3 in fees in year one. This type of investor-friendly expense structure helps investors defend the principal of their portfolios over time without coughing up too much in fees. For example, assuming this fee remains constant and that the fund returns 5% a year for the next 10 years, an investor will pay just $39 in fees over the course of the decade. Compare this to the multitude of ETFs on the market with expense ratios of 0.75%, where investors are paying $75 in fees on a $10,000 investment in just year one, and you really see the value proposition of an ETF like VOO.
Solid Long-Term Performance
With this diversification and investor-friendly expense ratio, it’s easy to see why this massive ETF is the most popular ETF in terms of inflows so far this year. Still, there’s also another factor leading to its popularity -- its long-term performance track record. VOO has consistently produced double-digit annualized total returns for its investors for a long time. No matter what time horizon you are looking over, VOO has delivered. As of the end of May, VOO had an annualized total return of 12.8% over a three-year time frame. Over a five-year time horizon, the massive ETF has delivered 11% total returns annually. Further, over the past 10 years, VOO returned 11.9% annually. VOO has been around since 2010, and since its inception that year, it has returned a stellar 13.3% on an annualized basis. 
Keeping Things Simple Can Pay Off
It doesn’t hurt to keep it simple. While there are plenty of exotic investment strategies out there, few beat an ETF like VOO over the long term. While this S&P 500 ETF isn't the type of investment that is going to give you a multi-bag return in a year, the reality is that few investments are. However, the good news is that investing in a broad-market ETF like this and allowing these gains to compound over the years is a time-tested way to build long-term wealth. Investors can dollar-cost average over time when they have a surplus of cash and/or when the S&P 500 falls while reinvesting dividends to amplify these results even more.
VOO’s strong performance track record, investor-friendly expense ratio, and portfolio of around 500 of the top U.S. stocks have made it a winner for a long time, and it's likely to remain a winner for the foreseeable future.

2023-06-14 00:00:00+00:00,Where Will Nvidia Be in 10 Years?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-will-nvidia-be-in-10-years-1,"The past decade has been outstanding for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors. Shares of the chipmaker have delivered handsome annual gains of more than 60% during this period, turning an investment of just $100 into more than $11,500.
Nvidia's terrific gains over the past 10 years can be attributed to its metamorphosis from a manufacturer of graphics cards meant for gaming personal computers (PCs) into a company whose chips are now used across a wide range of applications including data centers, cars, and digital twins. And now, Nvidia is right in the middle of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom with its chips playing a mission-critical role in the proliferation of this technology.
As such, it won't be surprising to see the next decade turn out to be a rewarding one for Nvidia investors, just like the last 10 years. This article will take a closer look at its key catalysts first and then see how much upside investors could expect from the stock over the next decade.
Nvidia's major growth drivers for the next 10 years
Nvidia pointed out on its investor day in March last year that it has a total addressable market (TAM) worth a whopping $1 trillion, spread across multiple verticals such as automotive applications, AI enterprise software, the omniverse, gaming, and chips and systems. Given that the company has generated just under $26 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months, it has massive room for growth.
The good part is that Nvidia is on its way to capitalizing on this tremendous opportunity already, especially in three major areas: chips and systems, automotive applications, and enterprise software. These three end markets account for $900 billion of the company's TAM, so progress in these areas will be crucial to its long-term growth. Let's look at how it is progressing in these markets.
The automotive opportunity
Nvidia's automotive business is a market where the company sees a $300 billion revenue opportunity. The demand for its chips in vehicles is growing thanks to their increasing levels of automation and connectivity. For instance, the chipmaker projects that the penetration of vehicles with level 2 and level 3 autonomous driving capabilities could increase from 10% last year to 50% in 2030.
And the growing number of cameras in each vehicle means that the amount of image processing is going to jump substantially. All this indicates that the need for Nvidia's graphics cards in the automotive market should increase because the large amount of data generated by each vehicle will have to be processed quickly to drive autonomous applications and connectivity.
And the company has built a solid ecosystem of customers, including original equipment manufacturers and component suppliers, that have helped it gain robust revenue in the automotive market.
In March last year, Nvidia was sitting on an $11 billion pipeline of automotive revenue. That figure has now increased to $14 billion, and it won't be surprising to see it head higher given the massive addressable opportunity in this space.
The second big catalyst, data centers, is where the company is on track to gain from two applications: enterprise data centers and hyperscale data centers.
The latter are large facilities that big data companies use to process huge amounts of data using fast connections. They are known for being scalable and can tackle intensive workloads. Enterprise data centers, on the other hand, are smaller than their hyperscale counterparts.
Nvidia sees a $150 billion revenue opportunity in hyperscale data centers, driven mainly by the growing adoption of AI. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are being increasingly deployed in data centers for training large language models and for inferencing purposes. For the record, inferencing is where the deep learning systems of AI meet the real world, making predictions about new, unseen data based on previous training. The chipmaker says that the use of GPUs for inferencing has shot up 9 times in the span of just three years.
Lastly, Nvidia's GPUs are being heavily used for training AI models. The company's graphics cards have been deployed for ChatGPT by OpenAI, and more companies keep joining the fray. Not surprisingly, there is reportedly a waiting period of two to three months for the chipmaker's AI-focused data center GPUs.
The data center business has generated $15.5 billion in revenue in the trailing four quarters, but there is still a massive opportunity in this space.
Terrific earnings growth is in the cards
The substantial growth opportunities discussed above tell us just why Nvidia's revenue and earnings are expected to head significantly higher.

Analysts also expect 21% annual earnings growth over the next five years, though it could increase faster thanks to the catalysts discussed above. Assuming earnings increase at even 25% a year from fiscal 2027 through fiscal 2033, its bottom line could jump to almost $59 per share after 10 years (using fiscal 2026's projected earnings as the base).
In other words, Nvidia's earnings could multiply by nearly 18 times over the next decade based on its fiscal 2023 bottom line of $3.34 per share. That would be a much faster increase than during the past decade.
NVDA net income (TTM); data by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months.
The company's improved earnings power over the next decade should have a positive impact on its share price as well. So investors who have held on to this tech stock over the past 10 years should continue to do so.
Investors currently have to pay a premium for Nvidia's stock, given its current price-to-earnings ratio of 205. However, the company's projected earnings growth and strong potential in sectors such as AI, automotive applications, and data centers still make a compelling investment case even at these lofty prices. And Wall Street expects Nvidia's bottom line to bloom -- the forward price-to-earnings ratio of 50 suggests substantial future earnings growth.
Nvidia is not just riding the coattails of technological advances but actively shaping an AI-powered future. With its robust product pipeline, strategic positioning, and solid growth trajectory, Nvidia appears well-equipped for the future, making it an attractive idea for long-term investors.

2023-06-15 00:00:00+00:00,First Citizen Bancshares and Icahn have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/first-citizen-bancshares-and-icahn-have-been-highlighted-as-zacks-bull-and-bear-of-the-day,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – June 15, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares First Citizen’s Bancshares FCNCA as the Bull of the Day and Icahn Enterprises IEP as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
Bull of the Day:
Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock First Citizen’s Bancshares is a North Carolina-based anomaly in the beaten-down banking sector. Early in the year, the Federal Reserve caught several regional banks off guard by raising interest rates at an unprecedented rate to quell inflation concerns (inflation was at 40-year highs at the time). Though the banking sector normally benefits from higher rates, several banks (particularly regional banks) were caught flat-footed. As Warren Buffett warns, “Only when the tide goes out do you learn who has been swimming naked.” As the contagion spread, several banks, such as Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank of New York, and Credit Suisse, began to go under. First Citizen’s Bank did not come out unscathed – from February to March the stock got hammered from $800 to $500.
Silicon Valley Bank Collapse: Crisis Equals Opportunity
What happened next would change the trajectory of the company. As you can see on the chart above, First Citizen’s Bank reversed course and is now at $1285 per share. In late 2022, Silicon Valley Bank, a publicly traded bank from California, began to incur significant losses due to rapid interest rate hikes. To make matters worse, as the name implies, Silicon Valley was heavily reliant on the tech industry for deposits. As the Nasdaq corrected and tech funding dried up, SVB incurred billions in losses. Finally, the FDIC stepped in to remedy the situation. The result? The FDIC sold off SVB’s assets to a variety of banks. With the help of the FDIC, FCNCA purchased more than $100 billion in deposits and more than $70 billion in loans from SVB at a more than $16 billion discount.
By the Numbers
Amidst a troubled banking sector backdrop, First Citizen’s Bank stands alone. FCNCA is dominating its industry from a historical EPS growth rate, projected sales growth, and margins perspective.
Furthermore, analysts believe that the SVB acquisition will be a significant earnings driver. Over the next two quarters, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest robust triple-digit earning’s growth.
Not only are analysts bullish, they are becoming more bullish by the day. The Zacks Consensus Estimate Trend shows Q1 EPS estimates of 21.78 per share 60 days ago and revised estimates of 47.98 per share now.
Firm Price and Volume Action
In late March, FCNCA gapped higher by more than 50% on volume ~900% above the norm. The flurry of buying pressure is indicative of institutional accumulation. Since the news broke, shares have rallied in a stair-stepping fashion and are consolidating in a tight range – indicating that investors are in no rush to sell shares.
Because stocks tend to leave consolidations in the direction they came into them, the odds favor a trend continuation in shares of FCNCA.
Conclusion
First Citizen’s Bancshares is a rare case of a bank successfully navigating the recent banking crisis. The purchase of Silicon Valley Bank for pennies on the dollar should be a fundamental catalyst for years to come. Furthermore, FCNCA is up 67% year-to-date, while the banking industry is down 15%. This makes one wonder how strong it will be if the banking sector continues to stabilize. Expect shares to be higher over the next 6-12 months.
Bear of the Day:
Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) Icahn Enterprises is a diversified holding company founded and controlled by billionaire Carl Icahn. Icahn Enterprises invests in investment management, metals, real estate, and home fashion companies through its subsidiaries and affiliates. Icahn Enterprises is known for its involvement in corporate governance matters and its efforts to management boards and decisions in the companies it invests in. As the company’s chairman, Carl Icahn plays a key role in setting its investment strategies and overseeing its operations.
Short-Seller Report: Hit Piece or Red Flag?
Last month, Hindenburg Research, a U.S. short-focusedinvestment researchfirm, unveiled a short report thesis on Icahn Enterprises. Shares of IEP swooned immediately following the report, dropping 55% for May on massive volume turnover.
In the short report, Hindenburg Research made bold accusations against IEP, claiming the company is inflating its illiquid private holdings. According to Hindenburg’s research:
·       IEP assets trade at a 218% premium to its last reported Net Asset Value (NAV)
·       IEP’s premium to NAV is higher than every closed-end fund and double the next highest.
·       IEP uses Carl Icahn’s legendary status and a hefty dividend to attract investors. Meanwhile, institutional investors have little to no exposure in the company.
What is Hindenburg’s Track Record?
Because short-focused research shops often release “hit pieces” to manipulate stocks for short-term gains, investors need to be wary of them. However, Hindenburg Research is an exception to this rule. In late 2020, Hindenburg accused EV-maker Nikola of fraud. Since then, the stock has dropped from $50 to $1.
Hindenburg also raised a red flag on the SPAC Clover Health. Like NKLA, CLOV dove and hasn’t looked back since. Most recently, Hindenburg pointed out accounting inconsistencies in Adani – India’s largest company. Since then, certain banks have stopped accepting Adani loans as collateral.
By the Numbers
Whether you agree with Hindenburg’s assessment or not, IEP’s fundamentals are unattractive at this juncture. Since 2018, IEP has posted negative EPS. Compared to its industry, IEP has lower historical EPS growth, projected sales growth, net margin, return on equity, and soaring debt.
Conclusion
With equities in a robust bull market, investors have ample opportunities outside Icahn Enterprises. The inflated NAV, poor fundamentals, and negative headlines should be red flags for prospective investors.

Capitalizing on the Boom in AI Software Development
By the time you are reading this, Apple will have unveiled its new VR/AR headset and the internet will be exploding with reactions.
It will no doubt be an excellent device and, more importantly, it will reveal directions for the mobile dominator's AI strategy.
I've been predicting Apple would own the category where devices and AI meet since 2017.
Wedbush Managing Director Daniel Ives, a Zacks friend and frequent guest on our podcasts, noted last week that all eyes will be on Tim Cook's keynote today to set the tone for developers and announce new products. Ives said Apple is finally set to unveil its mixed reality headset product named Vision Pro with price points in the $3k range running off a new operating system called xrOS.
He acknowledged how important this is since every tech stalwart has announced its own AI strategy with Microsoft and ChatGPT front and center, while Apple has been very quiet and non-existent on this front so far.
Ives believes this is about to change as he is expecting Cook & Co. to discuss Apple's AI strategy looking ahead and how the company can integrate and ultimately monetize its customer base around future generative AI coming from Cupertino.
Wedbush further expects Apple to head down the path to have its own AI driven solution that will be integrated within the Apple ecosystem.
What Hath ChatGPT Wrought?
If you wisely caught my Zacks Confidential article on March 20, you were given much of what you needed to know to assess and capitalize on the revolution.
I told you what was old, what was new, and what mattered for the stocks you could still buy that week, when my 5 recommendations were still trading at levels that could have produced some sizable double-digit gains for investors who followed...
NVDA: $265-270 and now $390
SNPS: $370-375 and now $450
GOOGL: $105 and now $125
SPLK: $90-95 and now $100
PATH: $16-17 and now $19
I wish I could have given you more ideas, including AAPL and MSFT. More on that coming up.
Tech Super Cycle is Alive and Well 
I’ve been trying to understand and explain the power of NVIDIA and GPU “massively parallel architectures"" since 2016.
And one of my most important Zacks Confidential entries was from December of 2017 where I recommended NVDA shares under $50. But it wasn’t the stock reco that stands out for me.
It was my thesis that I dubbed The Tech Super Cycle to explain why the hyper productivity of advances in semiconductors and software were sustaining a long-term environment of better, faster, cheaper that kept inflation at bay -- despite the zero interest rate Fed policy.
Of course, now that inflation has roared back with a vengeance, some will say I had it all wrong.
I don’t think so. That’s the thing about megatrends driven by technology innovation. They don’t die because of economic catastrophe, wars, pandemics, or bad government policy.
I bring this up today because many investing strategists are very concerned about recession, excessive valuations, and inflation. If you listened to them, you would be selling all your stocks and hunkering down for the apocalypse.
They could be right about reducing exposure in some areas or getting more diversification. But did selling semis or software in the scars of 2018, 2020, or 2022 really help? No way!
Obviously, Wall Street bears on technology are scary because they miss the forest for the trees. The evidence of revenues, profits, and valuations in the past 6 years tell me I was right about the Tech Super Cycle that will carry on through this decade.
The Meaning of NVIDIA Beyond $1 Trillion
It makes me laugh a little to be throwing praise on NVIDIA right now, after the world has discovered this AI juggernaut and all the journos can talk about is that it crossed some apparently magical mark... and now you should buy it.
By now you must be sick of the daily headlines about the company.
Then again, if you've been a steady investor/trader of NVDA shares with me for some time, you probably love it.
So let’s not only bask in the success, let’s keep learning about what is driving it. First up is a check-in with the one place I've been telling you to check-in with at least once a month for the past 5 years: The NVIDIA Newsroom.
Two exciting stories stand out lately...
World's Leading Electronics Manufacturers Adopt NVIDIA Generative AI and Omniverse to Digitalize State-of-the-Art Factories
This one warms my heart because ever since BMW adopted NVIDIA industrial simulation and design technologies -- including the Isaac Robotics platform -- for its new factories in 2018, I have been screaming that this is the future.
Second up is the continuing saga of the highest achievements by NVIDIA engineers that serve society by handing data power-tools to industry, science and medicine... 
NVIDIA Announces DGX GH200 AI Supercomputer
New Class of AI Supercomputer Connects 256 Grace Hopper Superchips Into Massive, 1-Exaflop, 144TB GPU for Giant Models Powering Generative AI, Recommender Systems, Data Processing
Recall they built a 5,760 GPU “super” for Tesla a few years ago that handles 1.8 exaflops (a billion billion floating point operations per second) for the exponentially-large parallel data sets in autonomous driving technology.
As I’ve suggested repeatedly since ChatGPT took the world by storm, every corporation, university, and research institution will want this kind of compute power now.
Beth Kindig Does the Math on NVDA > AAPL
Last year I shared the “crazy” view of an independent technology analyst who reasoned that because AI was a bigger megatrend opportunity than mobile, NVDA shares would over-take AAPL shares in this decade.
It’s still hard to wrap your head around -- but then again who predicted Apple would sell more than $75 billion worth of devices every quarter after quarter?
Here’s what Beth Kindig, founder of the I/O Fund and research house, wrote before NVIDIA’s May 24 report...
I've gone on record to say that Nvidia will surpass the valuation of Apple. That particular analysis compared the impact that AI will have to mobile, with AI adding $15 trillion to GDP compared to mobile’s $4.4 trillion. Mobile brought us three FAANGs: Apple, Google and Facebook. It has been my stance for years that AI will bring us a new set of FAANGs, one of which will be Nvidia.
However, now is not the best time to buy the stock. Rather than flatly tell you that while offering no way forward, I want to continue providing value to my readers by discussing when my firm plans to buy the stock again.
But also, we should discuss why the market is rallying on this company specifically. Good investors must do both – understand what makes a company stand out while being patient on price. Nvidia is trading 3X higher than its peers and in some cases 12X higher. I’m not defending this valuation, rather I want to explain how it’s possible that smart money continues to buy up here.
(end of excerpt from the I/O Fund letter)
You know that I have always tried to balance the euphoric valuation vs the tangible risk/reward. And that’s why I’ve done some trading with NVDA shares, getting out with some profits during the bear market and then jumping back in near the lows at $120 when nobody wanted it and Cramer said it was a “short.”
But more importantly I’ve tried to get you to see the paradigm shift that NVIDIA and its CUDA system hardware+software integrated stack represents to not just corporate data centers, but science and humanity overall.
I hope I’ve gotten through with that message over the years.
Besides the powerful medical applications, the next most exciting gold in Jensen Huang’s treasure chest is the potential to inspire millions of kids to be interested in science and math that can change their lives… and the world.
For Investors, It's All About AI-Fueled Software
Despite the bear market which took Software from euphoric 2021 bubble levels to minus 40%, I still firmly believe that nothing changes the world more powerfully than technological innovation.
This has been the case for thousands of years and the only things that have changed are (1) the exponential rate of innovations and (2) their synergistic convergence. In other words, separate technology platforms tend to accentuate and amplify the capabilities of each other, thus creating another layer of force multipliers.
For instance, as semiconductor technology has advanced – and shrunk transistors under 10 nanometers – this innovation combines with cloud/edge data storage and with AI/GPU/deep learning algorithms to create entirely new forms of engineering, materials science, and business intelligence with real-time data analytics, design, and decision making.
The technologies leverage each other simultaneously and synergistically. And I didn’t even mention quantum computing, which is on deck to rip the ceiling off of all of them. I’ll let a technology innovation expert with more experience than I explain.
Here’s how Peter Diamandis, author of The Future is Faster Than You Think, describes “exponential convergence” in a February 2022 blog post...
Accelerating the advancement of exponential technologies is actually old news. So, what’s the new news?
That formerly independent waves of exponentially accelerating technology are beginning to converge with other independent waves of exponentially accelerating technology.
In other words, these waves are starting to overlap—stacking atop one another, producing tsunami-sized behemoths that threaten to wash away (read: “reinvent”) most every industry in their path.
For example, the speed of drug development is accelerating. Not only because biotechnology (sequencing, CRISPR, etc.) is progressing at an exponential rate, but because AI, quantum computing, and other exponentials are converging on the field.
(end of excerpt from Peter’s blog)

2023-06-16 00:00:00+00:00,The 3 Best Stock Picks for the Booming AI Mega Trend,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-3-best-stock-picks-for-the-booming-ai-mega-trend,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
AI, also known as artificial intelligence, is an emerging technology with immense potential. While the concept has been around for a while, recent advancements have made it more practical. Now, computers can analyze data and make real-time decisions independently. The era of intelligent machines is no longer a distant dream but a tangible reality.
AI’s practical applications are revolutionary. It enables machines to learn, adapt, and perform complex tasks. Advanced AI powers cutting-edge technologies like voice and facial recognition, fraud detection, and pattern recognition. In the automotive industry, AI is utilized for real-time monitoring and the development of driverless vehicles. Indeed, the potential of AI is truly groundbreaking.
That said, here are three stocks you should secure once AI booms in the following months.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands out among AI stocks for a good reason. Notably, Nvidia is best known for its advanced graphics and video-processing chips. With expertise in high-end computing, AI, and virtual reality, Nvidia is poised to play a vital role in driving the metaverse.
Nvidia’s advanced chips are well-equipped to handle the processing demands of the immersive metaverse. The company’s Omniverse platform, designed for building and operating metaverse applications, also has the potential to become a leading solution for managing 3D data in this digital world.
Despite its incredibly high valuation, Nvidia is still among the most highly-rated stocks in the market. Investors and analysts alike continue to jump on Nvidia, given its picks-and-shovels exposure to the explosive AI megatrend.
The company’s recent guidance boost to revenue of $11 billion in the upcoming quarter, driven by AI, is evidence of why long-term investors are stocking with this name. Of course, if Nvidia can blow those expectations out of the water, a much higher valuation could be possible down the road. However, this company will certainly need to outperform to see such a scenario play out.
Currently, Bank of America recommends NVDA stock as a buy, with a target price of $500. Analysts note the company’s dominance in the GPU market and potential to profit from the surge in growth from AI-related companies as reasons to buy the stock. I agree.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is certainly among the top AI stock picks worth buying right now. The company’s collaboration between OpenAI and Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing product offers scalable computing power for widespread AI applications. This strategic partnership positions Microsoft as a potential winner in the AI revolution, particularly with the simplification of content creation through generative AI advancements.
Microsoft attributes its impressive first-quarter results to the growth of AI and its partnership with OpenAI. With confidence in the ongoing AI trend, Microsoft anticipates further profitability. The company already serves over 2,500 Azure OpenAI Service customers and provides AI-powered capabilities to 36,000 organizations through its Power Platform.
In the next five years, widespread adoption of generative AI by governments and businesses is expected. Microsoft’s strategic investment in OpenAI and integration of machine-learning capabilities across its products positions it as an AI leader. That said, investing in Microsoft can offer the opportunity to ride the wave of AI advancements and collect dividends along the way.
Baidu (BIDU)
Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com
Baidu’s (NASDAQ:BIDU) progress in generative AI bodes well for its future. The integration of Ernie 3.5 into its search engine is expected to improve user experiences and drive wider adoption of generative AI, leading to increased value growth for Baidu.
Baidu has launched a $140 million venture fund to support AI startups in the field of AI-generated content. They aim to foster innovation by encouraging developers to create applications using their large language model. Baidu’s commitment to integrating Ernie Bot across different sectors shows its dedication to enhancing products and services through generative AI. This strategic move highlights their determination to remain competitive in the AI industry and stimulate the growth of a productive AI ecosystem.
Baidu is also expanding its AI capabilities across its product offerings, including chatbots that can summarize financial statements and create presentations. The company’s Ernie Bot platform is in high demand, with over 120,000 Chinese companies signing up for testing. BIDU stock has seen a 32% gain in the past six months, with a 4% increase in 2023.
Despite experiencing a number of recent significant single-day rallies over the past few weeks, BIDU stock remains relatively unchanged from its 2023 low. This lackluster performance is surprising considering the company’s potential in AI. Baidu is currently trading at approximately 12 times this year’s earnings estimates, and analysts predict a growth rate of over 17% for the company. With these indicators, Baidu appears undervalued as one of the top AI stock picks right now.

2023-06-20 00:00:00+00:00,3 Dividend-Paying Technology Stocks With Big Growth,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dividend-paying-technology-stocks-with-big-growth,"Investors with a knack for dividends often target the utilities, finance, or consumer staples sectors. Companies within these three sectors often generate stable cash flows and deliver consistent earnings growth, helping vault them to the top of all income investors’ watchlists.
Still, a fair number of technology companies also reward their investors handsomely.
The technology sector is generally not targeted by income investors, as it’s common for companies within the sector to utilize their cash to fuel growth and future opportunities.
However, three exciting large-cap technology companies – NVIDIA NVDA, NetEase NTES, and Roper Technologies ROP – all provide investors with dividend payouts.
In addition, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, indicating near-term optimism among analysts. Let’s take a closer look at each.
NVIDIA
NVIDIA gripped the entire market following its latest blowout quarter, with the company posting results well above expectations and providing significant bullish revenue guidance. The stock presently sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

NVDA’s annual dividend presently yields a small 0.04%, lower than the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average. Still, the company’s remarkable growth trajectory helps pick up the slack, with earnings forecasted to soar 130% in FY24 and a further 33% in FY25.
It’s no secret that NVDA shares are pricey, currently trading at a 55.9X forward earnings multiple. Still, investors have had little issue forking up the premium thanks to the company’s remarkable growth profile.

NetEase
NetEase is an Internet technology company engaged in the development of applications, services, and other technologies for the Internet in China. Analysts have taken a bullish stance on the company’s earnings outlook, pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

NTES shares currently yield 1.9% annually, more than double that of the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average. The company has had little issue increasingly rewarding shareholders, boasting a 32% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.

The company posted results well above expectations in its latest release, delivering a 30% EPS beat. Quarterly revenue totaled $3.6 billion, ahead of expectations and slightly lower than the year-ago figure.
Roper Technologies
Roper Technologies, Inc. designs, manufactures, and distributes engineered products and solutions and software. Currently, the stock is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
ROP shares yield 0.6% annually currently, a tick below the Zacks sector average. Still, the company’s 10.6% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps pick up the slack in a big way.

For those looking for a potential entry point into ROP shares, the 50-day moving average could be considered. As we can see in the chart below, shares have recently bounced nicely off the level in the last two instances.

Bottom Line
While many income-focused investors target sectors such as utilities, finance, or consumer staples, the technology sector shouldn’t be forgotten.
Many technology stocks, including – NVIDIA NVDA, NetEase NTES, and Roper Technologies ROP – all provide a passive income stream.
In addition, all three boast strong growth profiles paired with favorable Zacks Ranks, undoubtedly a strong pairing.

2023-06-21 00:00:00+00:00,US STOCKS-Wall Street extends sell-off as Powell hints at further rate hikes,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-street-extends-sell-off-as-powell-hints-at-further-rate-hikes,"By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK, June 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's congressional testimony reinforced the central bank's objective to rein in inflation as he hinted at the likelihood of further interest rate hikes.
""It seems the market is catching its breath after a huge start to the month,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha. ""Historically June isn’t a very strong month for stocks, but this year could go down as one of the strongest Junes ever; so a small break in the run stocks have had is perfectly normal.""
Tesla Inc TSLA.O, along AI-related stocks such as Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O were the heaviest drags.
In his testimony before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, Powell reiterated the fact that the central bank remains ""strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal,"" and said it would be ""a pretty good guess"" that future rate hikes are in the cards if the economy continues on its current path.
""Two hikes, which is what the dot plot told us,"" Detrick said. ""There could be one more rate hike, but I don’t think anyone's buying the fact that there will be two. Markets are assuming that the Fed is very close to being done.""
At last glance, financial markets have priced in a 74% likelihood of another 25 basis point interest rate hike at the conclusion of July's monetary policy meeting, according to CME's FedWatch tool.
Powell is scheduled to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 22.98 points, or 0.52%, to end at 4,365.73 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC lost 165.09 points, or 1.21%, to 13,502.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 102.42 points, or 0.30%, to 33,952.64.
Tesla Inc was the biggest drag on the S&P 500, sliding after Barclays downgraded its rating on the stock to ""equal weight"" from ""overweight,"" saying the electric automaker's recent rally was too sharp relative to fundamentals.
""A big portion of today’s weakness is because Tesla had one of its worst days in a while,"" Detrick added. ""It's a stock that was due for a breather as well.""
""After a record win streak some kind of weakness is perfectly acceptable and normal.""
Package delivery firms FedEx FDX.N and United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N dropped after FedEx posted disappointing quarterly earnings and said waning global demand is pressuring its profit margins.
Crypto firms, including Coinbase COIN.O, Riot Platforms RIOT.O, Marathon Digital MARA.O and Bit Digital BTBT.O, advanced as Bitcon BTC=BTSP breeched the $30,000 level.

2023-06-22 00:00:00+00:00,"Jack Henry (JKHY) Unveils Fraud Monitor, Expands Portfolio",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jack-henry-jkhy-unveils-fraud-monitor-expands-portfolio,"Jack Henry JKHY has added a AI-based feature to its Payrailz digital payments platform called Payrailz Fraud Monitor.

Notably, the new feature, powered by AI and Machine Learning algorithms, offers real-time fraud detection across multiple payment types like person-to-person payments, consumer and business bill payments, and account-to-account outbound external transfers.

Further, Payrailz Fraud Monitor is capable of detecting account takeover by a fraudster on the back of behavioral analytics.

Moreover, it is designed to capture the incident when a fraudster tries to transfer funds out of an account using the original user’s credentials.

We note that Jack Henry is expected to gain solid momentum among various financial institutions and credit unions with Fraud Monitor, which holds the ability to reduce the number of suspicious transactions and stop fraudulent transactions automatically.
Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. Price and Consensus

Product Portfolio Expansion
The latest move bodes well for the company’s deepening focus on payments fraud reduction. In this regard, JKHY is set to make its cloud-based cross-channel fraud detection platform, Jack Henry Financial Crimes Defender, available this summer.

Moreover, the introduction of Payrailz Fraud Monitor is in sync with the company’s growing efforts toward expanding its overall portfolio.

The recent introduction of a policy management solution that combines workflows, documentation and storage on a single platform to streamline policy creation, review, approvals, attestations and exceptions, is a positive.

Furthermore, Jack Henry’s acquisition of Payrailz to expand payment capabilities for assisting financial institutions in effortlessly catering to the needs of consumer and commercial account holders is noteworthy.
Growing Clientele
The expansion of product offerings is expected to continue driving Jack Henry’s customer base in the days ahead.

Recently, Saco & Biddeford Savings Institution picked Jack Henry as its technology partner to modernize its infrastructure and enhance small business banking capabilities.

Further, Platinum Federal Credit Union teamed up with Jack Henry to enhance its members' financial health by leveraging the latter’s Symitar platform and comprehensive suite of solutions.

Also, Jack Henry’s modern core infrastructure was selected by First Community Bank, Sunrise Bank and Today's Bank to provide better service to retail and business customers.

We note that an expanding customer base is likely to contribute to Jack Henry’s top-line growth in the near term. This will aid the company in winning investors’ confidence in the near term.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for JKHY’s fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.05 billion, which suggests a 5.7% rise from the reported figure in fiscal 2022.

Coming to the price performance, shares of Jack Henry have lost 5.8% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry's decline of 19.8%.

2023-06-23 00:00:00+00:00,The Bull Case for High Dividend ETFs in SDOG,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-bull-case-for-high-dividend-etfs-in-sdog,"Dividends took the lead among investing themes towards the end of 2022, but megacap tech growth has stolen the show. Whether via spikes for names like Nvidia (NVDA) or simply by growth for the S&P 500, tech has overshadowed dividends. Still, dividends have powerful benefits outside of the admittedly potent mix of current income and stock exposure. Together they make the bull case for a high-dividend ETF like the ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs ETF (SDOG).
SDOG’s approach relies on investing according to the “Dogs of the Dow” theory. According to that strategy, the ETF invests in a portfolio that chooses the strongest dividend-yielding names from each of the Dow’s ten components. That’s helped SDOG offer a 4% annual dividend yield, outperforming both its ETF Database Category and FactSet Segment averages.

Those dividends, of course, are a powerful tool thanks to the current income they add to a portfolio. Not only that, dividends provide a helpful marker of firms’ health. At a time when any recession talk has focused on corporate profits, dividends can indicate which firms are better positioned. Dividends have also risen significantly in popularity among advisors.

The True Bull Case for High Dividend ETFs
The true bull case for high dividend ETFs, though, may be in the potential reinvestment of those dividends. At a time when it does seem as though growthier investment opportunities have ruled the day, adding dry powder helps. That reinvestment process alone makes a great case for adding a high-dividend ETF allocation like SDOG.
SDOG charges a 36 basis point fee to track the S-Network Sector Dividend Dogs Index. Though it started the year with a rough performance patch, it’s still returned 1.6% over one year. SDOG’s 4% annual dividend yield comes with a $2.00 annual dividend rate, as well. With more than ten years under its belt, SDOG presents a seasoned route into dividends. So when looking at ETFs like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), remember the benefit of dividends to investors eyeing a big upswing.

2023-06-26 00:00:00+00:00,3 Earnings Surprises That Make These Must-Watch Stocks,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-earnings-surprises-that-make-these-must-watch-stocks,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Earnings continue to be a significant driver of the impressive price performance we’ve seen thus far this year. A strong earnings beat and raised forward guidance (known as a “beat and raise”) continues to send various companies’ stock prices skyward. For example, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock surged 26% after impressive earnings, while Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock plummeted following its largest quarterly loss.
For investors who are managing their own portfolio, staying on top of earnings results of companies whose stocks they own is critically important. Successful investors typically hold stocks of profitable companies that consistently surpass earnings expectations and sustain growth. Here are three stocks you must watch due to their impressive recent performances.
ADBE Adobe $484.72
C Citigroup $46.02
ORCL Oracle $118.64
Adobe (ADBE)

Software developer Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) knocked it out of the park with its recent earnings. The company responsible for popular products like Photoshop, Illustrator, and PDFs exceeded Wall Street expectations with 10% year-over-year revenue growth in its fiscal second quarter, reaching $4.82 billion. Earnings per share came in at $3.91, beating analysts’ expectations for $3.79.
Adobe also announced that it generated cash flows of $2.14 billion during its latest quarter, up 5% from a year earlier. The company raised its guidance for the current fiscal third quarter, anticipating revenue between $4.83 billion and $4.87 billion. This amounts to approximately 10% year-over-year growth.
Earnings per share are forecast to come in between $3.95 and $4.00 per share, which would be annualized growth of 16% to 18%.
The company’s new guidance exceeded Wall Street’s expectations of $4.86 billion in revenue and $3.89 in earnings per share. If there’s an economic slowdown taking place, someone forgot to tell Adobe. So far this year, ADBE stock has gained 42%.
Citigroup (C)

Despite regional bank failures, larger financial institutions like Citigroup (NYSE:C) have remained resilient in the face of inflation and high interest rates. The lender reported first quarter earnings that handily beat Wall Street consensus expectations, on both the top- and bottom-lines. The lender reported Q1 revenue of $21.45 billion, which trounced forecasts for $19.99 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Citigroup’s Q1 earnings per share of $2.19 also trounced analysts’ views. Citigroup’s outperformance appears to be tied to personal banking revenue growth, which was up 18% year-over-year in the first quarter, due to elevated interest rates. Citigroup also reported over $1 trillion in deposits, and expressed confidence in navigating future challenges. This year, C stock is up 4%.
Oracle (ORCL)

Oracle’s (NYSE:ORCL) latest earnings were so good that it has many analysts and investors asking if the computer technology company is experiencing a renaissance. ORCL stock surged over 5% on strong earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations. Oracle reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings of $1.67 per share compared to the $1.58 that had been expected by analysts.
The company’s revenue in the quarter rose 17% year-over-year to $13.84 billion, versus the $13.74 billion that had been anticipated. The company’s cloud services and license support unit drove revenue growth of 23% to $9.37 billion in the quarter ended March 31. Furthermore, the company raised its guidance, expecting first-quarter earnings of $1.12 to $1.16 per share and 8% to 10% revenue growth.
Oracle also announced plans to develop its own generative A.I. cloud service. ORCL stock is up 45% year-to-date.

2023-06-27 00:00:00+00:00,New benchmark tests speed of systems training ChatGPT-like chatbots,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/new-benchmark-tests-speed-of-systems-training-chatgpt-like-chatbots,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
San Francisco, June 27 (Reuters) - MLCommons, a group that develops benchmark tests for artificial intelligence (AI) technology, on Tuesday unveiled results for a new test that determines system speeds when training algorithms used for chatbots like ChatGPT - and Nvidia NVDA.O came out on top.
The MLPerf benchmark is based on GPT-3, an AI model used to train ChatGPT, the viral chatbot developed by OpenAI and backed by Microsoft MSFT.O. However, because the model is huge, the benchmark only uses a representative portion.
""This was our most expensive benchmark so far,"" MLCommons Executive Director David Kanter told Reuters. ""We spent over 600K hours of accelerator compute time to develop it, plus some fantastically talented engineers.""
Kanter declined to disclose the cost of development, only saying it was in the millions of dollars.
Only two chip firms - Nvidia and Intel's INTC.O Habana Labs - submitted results for the benchmark, with the fastest time coming from systems using the latest H100 chip from Nvidia, the uncontested leader in hardware for training AI.
Nvidia's largest system submitted in partnership with AI cloud startup CoreWeave used 3,584 H100 chips, resulting in a training time of 10.94 minutes. Habana Labs, an AI chip company acquired by Intel, ran the benchmark in 311.945 minutes with a much smaller system equipped with 384 Gaudi2 chips.
Generally, more chips and a bigger system mean faster training.
Intel's Jordan Plawner, senior director of AI Products, said the results demonstrated the potential of Gaudi2, which will have a software update in September to boost speed.
""You will get a 1.5X to 2X speed up on the Habana results. So that's when we see Habana Gaudi2 being really competitive and lower priced than H100,"" Plawner told Reuters.
Plawner declined to say how much a Gaudi2 chip costs, but said the industry needs a second supplier of chips for AI training, and the MLPerf results show Intel can fill that need.

2023-06-28 00:00:00+00:00,US mulls new export restriction on computing power in AI chips,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-mulls-new-export-restriction-on-computing-power-in-ai-chips,"By Stephen Nellis and Karen Freifeld
June 28 (Reuters) - U.S. officials are considering tightening an export control rule designed to slow the flow of artificial intelligence chips to China by clamping down on the amount of computing power the chips can have, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The Biden administration last October issued a sweeping set of rules designed to freeze China's semiconductor industry in place while the U.S. pours billions of dollars in subsidies into its own chip industry.
An update to those rules may come by late July, two sources said, but one cautioned that such U.S. actions involving China often get delayed.
The U.S. Commerce department declined to comment.
Nvidia NVDA.O Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on Wednesday at an investors conference, ""Over the long-term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our data center GPUs to China, if implemented, would result in a permanent loss of opportunities for U.S. industry to compete and lead in one of the world’s largest markets and impact on our future business and financial results.""
The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday reported that the Biden administration was considering new restrictions on exporting AI chips to China.
One of the October rules limited the sale in China of chips that can provide the computing power needed to create artificial intelligence technologies similar to ChatGPT, a move that immediately impacted sales of products from Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O, and would likely affect future offerings from Intel Corp INTC.O.
The possible rule tightening would hardest hit Nvidia, whose strong position in the AI chip market helped make it worth $1 trillion earlier this year.
""""We do not anticipate that such additional restrictions, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact on our financial results,"" Nvidia's Kress said on Wednesday.
Questions have arisen about how effective the October rule will be in slowing Chinese companies' development of AI systems.
Nvidia has made special chips for the Chinese market that comply with the October restrictions, but Reuters reported last month that major Chinese companies such as Tencent Holdings 0700.HK plan to use Nvidia's export-compliant chips to cut the time it takes to train huge AI systems by more than half.
The current rule around AI chips involves two restrictions. One restriction focuses on how fast chips can communicate with each other, which is important because AI systems such as ChatGPT require thousands of chips to be chained together. The other restriction focuses on how much computing power the chip can have.
The H800 chip that Nvidia created for the Chinese market, for example, has as much computing power at some settings used in AI work as the company's chip for the rest of the world, but its chip-to-chip speeds are limited, according to a specification sheet seen by Reuters.
Intel declined to comment. AMD declined to comment. Previously, AMD have said the rules will not have an impact on its financial results.

A negative news related to A.I. chip export to China also dampened market participants sentiment. The Dow and the S&P 500 ended in negative territory while the Nasdaq Composite finished in positive zone.
How Did The Benchmarks Perform?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 0.2% to close at 33,852.66. Notably, 14 components of the 30-stock index ended in negative territory, while 16 in positive zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 13,591.75, gaining 0.3% due to strong performance of large-cap technology stocks.
The S&P 500 fell marginally by 1.55 points to end at 4,376.86. Six out of 11 broad sectors of the benchmark ended in negative territory while 5 finished in positive zone. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) tumbled 1.5% while the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) advanced 1%.
The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was up 2.3% to 13.43. A total of 9.89 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 11.57 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.
Powell Reaffirms Tighter Monetary Control
On Jun 28, during a monetary policy session in Sintra, Portugal, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank is likely to pursue multiple hikes in interest rate at an aggressive pace. According to Powell, “We believe there’s more restriction coming. What’s really driving it ... is a very strong labor market.”
The Fed raised the benchmark lending rate from the range of 0-0.25% in March 2022 to the range of 5-5.25% in May 2023. The massive rise in the Fed fund rate was solely aimed to combat a 40-year high inflation. In its latest FOMC meeting in June, the Fed paused rate hike after 10 consecutive increases.
However, in his post-FOMC statement, the Fed Chairman warned that more rate hikes are expected in this year. The inflation rate declined steadily from its peak on June 2022. However, it still remained well above the central bank’s target rate of 2%.
The “dot plot” of the Fed’s June FOMC meeting showed most of the Fed officials are expecting two more rate hike of 25 basis points each. This implies, the Fed fund rate could reach in the range of 5.5-5.75% by the end of 2023. The terminal interest rate likely to settle at 5.625% instead of 5.125% anticipated at the end of May FOMC.
Moreover, last week, central banks of the UK, Switzerland, Norway and Turkey raised their respective benchmark lending rates. Market participants are concerned that higher interest rate will hinder economic activities resulting in global economic recession.
Turmoil in U.S. Chipset Industry
The Wall Street Journal reported that the Biden administration is mulling about renewed restrictions on exports of high-tech A.I.-enabled semiconductors to China. The report said that the Department of Commerce may restrict the shipment of high-end A.I.-enabled chipsets to China in as early as July.
A section of market researchers is concerned that a ban of A.I. chipsets to China not only affect its economic growth but also its military ambitions. This may lead to a geopolitical economic warfare.
Following the news, shares of NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, the leader of the A.I.-enabled semiconductor manufacturers, fell 1.8%. The company generates more than 25% of its revenues from China. As a result, export ban of its most advanced semiconductors may turn a major headwind. NVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2023-06-30 00:00:00+00:00,1 Green Flag and 1 Red Flag for Nvidia in 2023,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-green-flag-and-1-red-flag-for-nvidia-in-2023,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has enjoyed a massive bull run this year, with its stock up by about 180% since Jan. 1. That's a stark improvement from the 50% decline the company's shares experienced amid the macroeconomic headwinds of 2022. Nvidia's shift from being a primarily PC-gaming-focused business to AI development has helped strengthen its outlook and make it less reliant on consumer chip sales (alongside its continued success in its data center segment, of course).
As a result, it's not a bad time to consider investing in this tech giant before its stock price flies any higher. However, before you pick up shares, it would be wise to familiarize yourself with the negative and positive aspects of the company. Nvidia's AI potential will need to outweigh its stock's expensive valuation.
Here is one green flag and one red flag for Nvidia in 2023.
Green flag: Lucrative partnerships in multiple areas of tech
Before this year, Nvidia was best known for its powerful consumer graphics processing units (GPUs), which are extremely popular among PC gamers. The company was a major growth driver in the $32 billion PC gaming industry. Nvidia's success in that arena allowed it to expand to other markets, forming lucrative partnerships with some of the biggest names in tech.
For instance, Nvidia's GPUs have provided computational muscle to the world's biggest cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, for over a decade. That partnership significantly bolstered Nvidia's data center segment and allowed it to lean less on consumer chip sales. In fact, data centers surpassed gaming in fiscal 2022 as its top sales segment, with revenue rising 41% year over year to $15 billion.
Moreover, Nvidia's position as the main chip supplier of OpenAI's ChatGPT has solidified its transition from a gaming company to a leading AI chip designer. According to data from TrendForce, ChatGPT's processing needs for training data alone utilized the equivalent of about 20,000 GPUs in 2020, with that figure expected to exceed 30,000 as the platform readies for commercialization.
Between Amazon and ChatGPT, Nvidia has become the primary chip provider to the biggest names in cloud computing and AI. As both markets develop, Nvidia's ability to supply its hardware to other companies in those spaces only strengthens its outlook.
Red flag: There are cheaper ways to invest in AI
The downside of Nvidia's recent rally is that much of the company's potential near-term growth is now baked into its price. The chart below illustrates how Nvidia's stock has experienced more than twice the growth of many other AI stocks this year.
Data by YCharts.
Nvidia now trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 211. Usually, investors would view a P/E as attractive if it were below 20. However, the good news is there are still plenty of ways to take advantage of the booming AI market. For one, you can still buy Nvidia stock with plans to hold it for the very long term. The company's shares have risen by more than 11,000% in the last decade. Considering its solid position in AI, there's no telling how high Nvidia's stock could soar over the next 10 years.
However, if you're more of a bargain shopper, some other attractive options are Intel, Alphabet, and Microsoft, with their considerably lower price-to-earnings ratios of 16, 27, and 36, respectively. Each of them has made AI a growing focus of its business, with Intel striving to challenge Nvidia in chips, Alphabet developing a competitor to ChatGPT, and Microsoft dominating AI services as the biggest investor in OpenAI.
Nvidia continues to have a strong outlook over the long term, thanks to the varying applications for its chips across the tech market. However, the company will likely need a fair amount of time for its business results to live up to its current valuation.

Stock Advisor returns as of July 3, 2023
This video was recorded on June 30, 2023.
Ron Gross: As the first half of 2023 comes to a close, we've got some encouraging economic data, and earnings from Nike, and we'll look at how the housing market has held up so far this year. Motley Fool Money starts now.
It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Ron Gross sitting in for Dylan Lewis. Joining me today are Senior Analysts Andy Cross and Jason Moser. Fools, how you doing? Fools, believe it or not, 2023 is half over. The stock market has rebounded nicely from the 2022 lows, with the S&P up about 15.5% and the Nasdaq up a whopping 31.5%. By the way, Apple's market cap now tops $3 trillion. Today we're going to talk semiconductors and spice and everything Nike. See what I did there, Fools. But we begin with the big macro. On Thursday, revised data showed that the economy actually increased at a 2% annualized pace in the first quarter, up from the previous estimate of 1.3%, and we got some encouraging inflation data on Friday. Earlier in the week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that more interest rate increases are unlikely as the job market remains strong. So Andy, not bad. All things considered, is good news actually good news here, or does this just give the Fed cover to continue to raise interest?
Andy Cross: The good news is that the US economy, the most important in the world, is doing pretty well, especially considering where many economists and, frankly, investors had thought we were heading at the start of 2023. Inflation moderating, things are looking up. But that quarter rate, Ron, is still two times where the Fed really wants to be, so the strong economy in that pesky inflation gives more cover for the Fed to raise rates, probably at least once, maybe even two or three times this year, as the Fed Chair implied. The odds are running right now at about 85% for another 25 basis increase next month after Chair Powell said his remarks over in Europe this week. When you think about the real GDP, it got revised to 2%, annualized up from the 1.3 pace that they had originally forecasted, and the Q2 estimates have been steadily moving up with the Atlanta Fed now. The GDP now forecasted at 1.8%, which is about where S&P Global is estimating as well. Consumer spending up 4.2% in the quarter revised from an increase of 3.8% as the strongest in about two years, although from that PCE number, just today, it saw that May data, that spending, is moderating up just 0.1% versus an increase of 0.6%, and that's month-to-month where it was in April. You have the US economy strong, you have employment still very strong. We are starting to see a little bit of moderation on the employment, but unemployment rate at 3.7%, so only 6.1 million Americans out of work, so that economy still looks strong. Very interesting thing is that the stocks are just rolling with this. You talked about the impressive market performance this year. I think that investors have gotten used to, we might have another one or two increases, but business is strong, the recession that everyone was forecasting might get pushed out, and things are looking pretty good for the US economy, and that speaks well for businesses and for stocks.
Ron Gross: I just hope that consumer spending is not at the expense, so to speak, of their savings or of higher credit card levels. Consumers be careful out there.
Andy Cross: For sure.
Ron Gross: On Thursday, McCormick reported strong results and raised its full year profit outlook, but the stock actually sold off a bit, Jason. You tell me, what am I missing here?
Jason Moser: Ron, you buy the rumor and sell the news. That's what they say. Seriously, though, I don't think you're missing anything here. With the slight sell-off there, as well as the raised earnings guidance, this still puts the stock around 33 times the full-year forecast. It's not a cheap stock still, so to speak. It's a little bit of a lofty multiple [inaudible] for this company. But it does garner that lofty multiple for a number of reasons: its competitive position, the nature of what they sell, its Dividend Aristocrat status. So to me, this is nothing more than maybe a little profit-taking. But I think the good news is, when you look at the quarter, the results were really strong all the way across. Volumes are up, they're maintaining pricing, and they're controlling costs, and that's really all you can ask. Management is taking a very confident tone regarding the back half of the year as well. Maybe something the market took a little bit of a note of here, we do have a leadership transition. Long-time CEO Lawrence Kurzius is going to be moving over to Executive Chairman. COO Brendan Foley will become the next CEO, starting in September. Foley has been with the company for about a decade, very experienced in this space. He was with Heinz before joining McCormick, and I think, ultimately, again, going back to the numbers, they really tell an encouraging story. Revenue was up 10%, excluding currency impacts, gross margin, up 310 basis points, earnings per share, up 25%, raised guidance, like you said, and as I mentioned, pricing remained strong, and costs are staying at our controls, so I think a very encouraging quarter for the company.
Ron Gross: More importantly, do you have a favorite flavor of Cholula Hot Sauce?
Jason Moser: I'm an OG. I've tried that lime, which is good, but really, I'm an OG.
Ron Gross: Andy.
Andy Cross: Same with me. I dislike straight-up. What I grew up with, and that's what I'm sticking with.
Ron Gross: The correct answer is sweet habanero.
Andy Cross: I have to give it a shot.
Ron Gross: On Thursday, Nike reported fourth-quarter sales that topped expectations, but profits came in slightly lower than expected. Andy, the report looks solid to me from a revenue perspective. But gross margins were down; overhead expenses were up. I ask you, do we have an expense problem here?
Andy Cross: No, more of a challenge than I'd say a problem, Ron. Margins were actually a little bit higher than the consensus analyst estimates, and those margins should really improve down the line next year with the CFO saying on the call, we can now see around the corner on the transitory cost headwinds that pressure the profitability in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, they just finished their fiscal 2023, by the way, and we are confident that we will deliver above average margin improvement in fiscal 2024, that's the next 12 months. Let's look at the quarter revenue. It's up 5%. These are all not adjusting for the strong currency. Nike Direct, up 15%, Nike-owned stores, up 24%, Nike Digital, up 17%, and Nike digital now about one-quarter of revenues versus where that was pre-pandemic, which was about 10%. Wholesale was a little bit of the weakness. That was down 2%. Big strength in China, Ron, 25% when you back up the strong dollar, with footwear, up 22%, and apparel, up 36%. Now on the margin side, as you mentioned, margins were down 140 basis points to 43.6% on those higher input costs, elevated freight and logistics costs, but they expect that to roll over and improve pretty dramatically in 2024, so admin costs, up 8% too, as you mentioned, overhead expenses, up 10%, on a lot of higher wages. The one impressive part to the story was really on the inventory side. We saw inventories flat on a dollar basis and actually down on a unit basis. Nike inventories were up 16% last quarter, so that is a real improvement. They increased the dividend payouts by 9%. You have a stock that sells at about 30 times earnings, so I wouldn't be in a rush to go out and buy this. But Nike is such an institution when it comes to footwear, when it comes to retail apparel, when it comes to sports apparel, and they continue to innovate and get a lot of different athletes and new products out there. I think I wouldn't be too worried about the margin story this quarter.
Ron Gross: General Mills reported mixed results, and its profit outlook was softer than investors were hoping for. Jason, a lot of talk on the call about retailers keeping inventories tight. Was that the primary drag here?
Jason Moser: I think you're right. That was certainly part of the call. Supply chain and inventory dynamics continue to be a part of the story with companies like General Mills. But management did speak to this specifically on the call. They really don't see this as a General Mills specific problem. Furthermore, they don't really see it as a problem going forward. It boiled down for them to two of their largest customers just trying to right-size their balance sheets and their inventory levels, and that just trickles through General Mills numbers. But the numbers were respectable, and organic net sales grew 5%. That was partially offset by those inventory headwinds we're just talking about. Adjusted gross margin, up 120 basis points. Operating profit of 889 million, essentially flat from a year ago. Now these adjusted numbers account for some investments and some divestitures made over the past year so that we understand each other, Ron. You look at me sometimes with those quizzical looks. I'm, like, that's the adjustment.
Ron Gross: Earning is essentially flat at 1.12. I think the outlook for the upcoming year looks strong. They're getting these inventory levels right-sized. They do feel organic net sales were poised to grow 3-4% for the coming year, and the best news really, this is why you own the stock, they raised the dividend by 9% for the quarter, so all in all, I think, not so bad. Solid dividend, only 17 times forward. I say only 17 times forward, so not bad.
Jason Moser: Everybody likes cereal.
Ron Gross: Sounds good. Coming up, we'll talk airlines and drugstores, and we'll see what's going on with the Biden administration and the computer chip industry. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ron Gross here in studio with Andy Cross and Jason Moser. Earlier in the week, Delta reported strong quarterly results and management raised its 2023 guidance. Andy, Delta shares are up 42% this year as the airline continues to recover in a post-pandemic world. Is there still room for improvement here, or are we almost fully recovered?
Andy Cross: Reinstating that dividend earlier this month definitely helped drive some of the gains, now about a 0.9%. They had $0.10 quarterly dividend, that was versus a 40 cent quarterly before the pandemic, before they cut it. So a lot of enthusiasm for air travel on Delta. It's one of the best out there. You mentioned the quarter that they had, revenue was up 45%, and 14% higher than the March quarter of 2019, then an operating income of more than 500 million versus a loss. Operating expenses, up 26%, with non-fuel costs up 24%. So again, revenues up 45%, cost up in the mid-20s. That's a really good quarter. Their guidance was strong. Revenue, up 17-20%, operating margin of 10-12% guided. That will equate to about an earnings per share somewhere between $5 or $6. So you have a stock that sells at $46, maybe $6 of earnings, that's about a seven times forward guidance for the year. You have a little bit of a dividend. No wonder the stock has performed so well, especially with so much interest in air travel, capacity has come back. They're starting to see both consumer really ramp up on spending when it comes to air. A little bit of business, they're small and medium-sized businesses. Travel has come back. They're still waiting a little bit on some of the large and some of the international. So really Delta, really getting it done in the stock. While it has a nice run, look for a little pullback before you start adding to it.
Ron Gross: NVIDIA and other chip companies were down this week, and report is that the Biden administration is considering new artificial intelligence chip export restrictions for China. The report indicated that the curbs could come as quickly as next month. Jason, are NVIDIA and, potentially, AMD, the companies most impacted by this, or do you think this will have repercussions across the industry?
Jason Moser: I think they are two of the obvious suspects. I would throw Marvell and, honestly, others in there as well, as at least exposed to this. Marvell has 42% of its revenue coming from China. AMD and NVIDIA has more around 22%. But I think this really also goes to the nature of the technology that's being shipped out right here. This is about artificial intelligence. This is about military-grade applications and the likes. So companies like NVIDIA and AMD are two that are really playing in that sandbox, but again, so is Marvell. If you look at these three companies and their AI aspirations, recently, NVIDIA guided for 64% revenue growth, thanks in large part to ""a steep increase in demand related to generative AI and large language models."" AMD's CEO Lisa Su says AI is ""our Number 1 strategic priority."" Then you look at Marvell, they're talking about their AI revenue doubling this fiscal year to $400 million and then doubling again from that next fiscal year to $800 million. So you look at these companies, they're all exposed. Worth noting too, the Netherlands just announced they're getting on board here with these restrictions. The reason this matters, the Netherlands is home to ASML. They make the machinery that is required to produce the most advanced chips, so just interesting to see how they're siding on the US side of this equation so far.
Ron Gross: After an initial sell-off on Monday, Carnival shares shot higher this week on strong bookings and better-than-expected results. Andy, Carnival stock is up 130% so far this year, but that is still way off from pre-pandemic levels. What stood out to you in this report?
Andy Cross: Ron, the $17 stock today, that hit almost 70 in 2018 when it was making three billion operating profits versus losses for the past four years. But the turnaround is clearly in place, and investors are warming up to that. You saw revenues more than double this quarter, ticket revenues up 144%, onboard revenues of 59%. They're going to start generating some of their EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation, and amortization of more than 600 million this quarter versus a loss of 928 million in Q2 22. That was above our high-end guidance of 600-700 million. Cruise ticket prices are now above 2019 levels. Net per diem are suspending onboard when you're on the cruise ships were up 7.5%. That was above guidance. Their guidance for 2023, they expect 100% occupancy, even with a 5.7% more capacity into their ships with higher overall net ticket prices compared to 2019. So when you look at this business, you're saying, wow, the cruise business is cruising right along, doing quite well. But overall, I got to say, it's not a great business when you look at the long-term trends of Carnival. It just meander. There's a long returns on capital of the low double-digit operating margin. Even operating margin can be quite good. But there's so much capital that has to go into these businesses. I think the returns are really pretty much more like market-matching at best. Especially after this, Ron, I wouldn't chase Carnival, especially when it sells at probably 33 times or so forward earnings.
Ron Gross: Earlier in the week, Walgreens' stock fell sharply as the company lowered its financial outlook amid weaker consumer spending. Jason, I'm curious, is this a macro problem in your eyes or something specific to Walgreens?
Jason Moser: Probably a little bit of both. I'm going to waffle there, Ron.
Andy Cross: Waffle away.
Jason Moser: Thank you. It does look like the headwinds are going to continue for some time to come. Management set the table for a potentially challenging fiscal 2024. Any time you see mention of the word turnaround and the release, and we saw that here, that's a bit of a yellow flag, at least. There are a couple of main dynamics at play here though, the demand for COVID shots and testing has cooled off considerably. That's clearly not a Walgreens-specific problem. CVS was just talking about the very same thing last month, and I think that these companies are going to have to gear for that going forward. But management also did note, there is a more cautious and value-driven consumer out there. One thing that's sticking out of my mind here now that we've seen this Supreme Court ruling come down in regard to the student debt relief, and then we know these payments are going to start back up here around October, it's reasonable to think that consumer might be a little bit more crimped here in the near term. So it'll be just keeping an eye on that as far as retailers go.
The good part for Walgreens though they do continue to invest in their US healthcare segment, and they continue to grow the top line in that business, but it's one where they continued to invest a lot as well. So it's recording operating losses, but it brings more of a tech flavor to their business in healthcare solutions, so partnerships with things like VillageMD, Shields, and CareCentrix. These are working well for the company, but the bottom line, at the end of the day, you're right, they cut full-year earnings guidance by about 12%. That's a big deal for a company like this that has a track record of really meeting and beating expectations on a regular basis. So I don't know. I feel like there's probably a light at the end of the tunnel, and maybe this represents a time for investors to get interested in the stock. But it also looks like the near-term headwinds are going to continue for Walgreens for some time to come.
Ron Gross: Quick answer, yes or no. Jason, the Nasdaq is higher or lower at the end of the year than it is now. I won't hold you to it.
Jason Moser: Yes.
Ron Gross: Andy.
Andy Cross: Yes.
Ron Gross: I say no.
Andy Cross: I'm going to hold you to that, Ron.
Ron Gross: All right, Fools. We'll see you a little bit later in the show. Up next, the conversation with Dave Meyer, the VP of Growth and Analytics at BiggerPockets on the state of the housing market. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ron Gross. We're halfway through the year, so it makes sense to check in on where things are sitting across the market. Motley Fool Money's Deidre Woollard caught up with Dave Meyer, the VP of Growth and Analytics at BiggerPockets to talk through how the housing market has held up so far this year in the face of higher interest rates and weather trends like aging in place and Sunbelt migration are here to stay.
Deidre Woollard: We're right about the halfway point of the year. What would you say has been some of the main stories in real estate, so far?
Dave Meyer: I think there are two primary stories in real estate. The first is about inventory. We all know that mortgage rates are rising, so I guess you could say that is the story, but that is the well-known story. I think the thing that people were not necessarily expecting is that inventory, or supply in the real estate market, would come down at the same time as higher interest rates were pulling demand out of the market, and it would provide some stability in the housing market, and so overall, I think what most people who follow the housing market are surprised to see is how resilient it has been in the face of rising interest rates in 2023.
Deidre Woollard: It's true. Existing home sales have been down about 20%, but prices have fallen, I think, about 3%. So really what we're seeing is, you don't have that massive price drop that people thought that we might have.
Dave Meyer: That's right, and I know that's confusing to people because there is demand leaving the market. We do see that there are fewer home sales, we do see mortgage purchase applications are down, but inventory is historically low. Redfin actually just came out a couple of days ago and said that May of 2023 was the lowest amount of inventory they've ever seen in their history of tracking that. So that helps provide some background context for why prices aren't in freefall while some people were expecting them to be.
Deidre Woollard: Do you have any predictions for the future for the rest of the year? Is this inventory crisis going to resolve itself?
Dave Meyer: I don't think it's going to anytime soon. There are some pretty big factors that are driving this extremely low inventory. The first is, of course, the rapid increase in interest rates and that has created what people in the industry are calling the lock-in effect, and that's basically that people don't want to move because if they wanted to make a lateral move and go to a similar house, they would be paying significantly more, sometimes 40% more on their mortgage. If they wanted to move up, it would be extremely expensive, and I think one of the main dynamics going on here is that, even if you wanted to downsize, maybe you're an empty nester, and you're looking to downsize, you could be paying just as much or more to have a smaller house, and so that's really keeping people in place. That to me is the primary dynamic. But there are other trends. We've seen the average homeowner is now staying in their home for more than 12 years, whereas if you go back to 2005, it was six-and-a-half years. So it's nearly double. People are staying in their homes longer, so we're just not seeing the same velocity of sales that we were used to in previous decades. Of course, during periods of economic uncertainty, you also just see people not wanting to make big financial decisions like moving.
Deidre Woollard: That's true. One of the factors that I'm watching is the whole aging-in-place phenomenon because we thought that people were going to move to Arizona or Florida, and certainly people are moving to Arizona and Florida. But most people really are wanting to age in place, and that I think is going to have to shake out at some point. Our baby boomers are in their late '70s now. It doesn't seem possible that everyone's going to be able to stay in their homes into their '90s. Over the long term, how should we be thinking about that demographic shift?
Dave Meyer: It's really interesting. I think we're just starting to see. We've heard a lot about the intention for people to age in place, but as you alluded to, we don't know if that's really what's going to happen. I do think this dynamic is one of the main reasons we're seeing that increase in homeowner tenure increase as people don't move out or go to another living situation. But I think this has a big impact, not just on total supply, but it really stops and clogs up the entire housing market system as it works. Typically there's this pattern where young families, people in their late '20s or early '30s, they buy a ""starter home"". Then a couple of years later, they move up to their family home. Maybe they have one or two of those, maybe if they have kids growing up. Then at a certain point, they want to downsize into a smaller place. But given some of the things we've been talking about, we're not really seeing people downsize, and that means that they are clogging up this whole upward trajectory of people and the changing hands of these different property types. What you see is that the type of housing that the boomers are in are often the same type of homes that are for first-time homebuyers because they're the smaller where they've downsized into them. So that creates this bottleneck, and as you've probably seen, first-time homes, smaller homes, starter homes are just not really available, and I think this is one of the major drivers of that is that boomers are not vacating them.
Deidre Woollard: That's true. The starter home thing is tending to exist less because people, mostly, I think due to the impact of student loans, they're buying their first home later. They're buying their first home later. They're trying to save money before that. They expect to stay in their homes much longer. Like the NAR profile of home buyers and sellers, we talked about people staying in their homes like 7-10 years. They forecast when they ask people how long they think they're going to stay in their home, they're saying 15, 20 years which may or may not play out. But there is this expectation that, I'm buying my forever home the first time, and that's just it.
Dave Meyer: That would be a big change in dynamics, but it does seem more that that's what's happening. We also see builders reacting to that because builders are now not building the ""starter home,"" which most people categorize as a home of 1400 square feet or less. We're now seeing the average home that people buy, even on the first one, is 2500 square feet. That would be more conducive to what most people would want if they had a couple of kids, and so we see those people buying those right away probably in preparation for what you're saying. It's that they don't intend to leave. They don't want to do the starter home, the family home. They just want to get in one home and stay there for as long as they can.
Deidre Woollard: It's interesting. The other part of this, I think, is new homes. The new home, permits and everything, had been down about last year, so maybe starting to go up a little bit now. But home builders, they want to try to time the market. They want to build when people are ready to buy. But at this point, one of the things I'm noticing is that, with existing home inventory being so low, new home inventory is a greater part of the total homes for sale. I wonder, do you think that's going to be a long-term trend?
Dave Meyer: I think it's one of those interesting dynamics going on, and my guess is that, at least for the time being, I don't see really how some of these impediments to inventory alleviate themselves in the short term. The lock-in effect doesn't seem to be going away. People seem to be wanting to stay in their homes longer, and honestly, it's not a good experience to buy or sell a house right now. It's really stressful to people. I think people are avoiding it, and builders are reacting to that. During normal years, new home sales, new construction, comprises about 11% of total home sales. It's above 30 right now, and in some places, it's even higher, and builders are seeing this as a huge opportunity, I think. You see, yes, it is down from the peak, but just in May, new permits went up 5% month-over-month, which is a pretty considerable increase, and I think most people, myself included, thought builders were going to be really pretty bearish over the next couple of months. But I think the opposite, at least in single-family home construction, is happening. I do think they're staying away from commercial construction, but that's another topic.
Deidre Woollard: I think this month was the first time the builder sentiment survey went back up over 50%, which means builders are feeling more positive, and I think the incentives that they're having to offer have dropped a little bit too, so it really is a sign that people are back out there looking, and I think part of that is, the sticker shock of the mortgages may have sunk in a little bit. Thinking about mortgage rates, do you think that we are in now getting into a more stable place?
Dave Meyer: It's very difficult to forecast mortgage rates these days.
Deidre Woollard: It certainly is.
Dave Meyer: But my best guess is that we're probably going to see similar mortgage rates through the rest of the year, which is high sixes, somewhere around there. We have obviously heard that the Fed intends to raise interest rates another 25 or 50 basis points which would put upward pressure on mortgage rates. But what I think people need to know about where mortgage rates stand right now is that they are most closely correlated with the yield on the 10-year treasury, not with the federal funds rate, and normally, the spread between the yield on the tenure and mortgage rate is about 170, 190 basis points. Right now, it's about 320 basis points, and so there is a huge risk premium in mortgage rates, and so there is room. I think you could see it going either way. Like the Fed raises interest rates, mortgage rates could go up. But if inflation keeps coming down, even if the Fed raises interest rates, if that spread starts to come down, there is reason to believe mortgage rates will at least be stable. A lot of economists are forecasting that mortgage rates will come down, maybe not by the end of this year but probably early in 2024, maybe to the low sixes.
Deidre Woollard: Sunbelt migration, big story for the last decade or so. Do you see that as the future? I'm starting to see some data showing up, maybe a little bit more of a move to some of the Midwest areas just because of people chasing value. What are you seeing in terms of demographic trends?
Dave Meyer: People think I'm crazy, but I've been saying that I'm long on the Midwest for a long time. I just think we see these big macro trends that our people want affordability. They don't need to be close to the economic engines as they used to be, like San Francisco or New York. You can live remotely, not everyone, but more and more people can, and I think we're going to see a lot of the cities in the Midwest that are affordable and start to grow, and I think the quality of life, which is hard to measure, it's hard to quantify, but that seem to be another major predictor of where people are going to live. Obviously, everyone defines quality of life a little bit differently. But generally speaking, the cities that rank high for high quality of life do start to see big trends.
Dave Meyer: I don't think the Southeast is really going anywhere. I don't think we're going to see like an exodus from that at all. But I do think like their relative growth rate will probably slow, and we'll see some other places, like you said, Midwest. You see places, like in Arkansas, which is the Southeast but is not what most people think of. I think most people think of the Carolinas and Tennessee and Georgia and Florida. So some of these other places really start to grow, mostly at the expense of Western cities which are seeing the biggest out migration.
Ron Gross: You can catch more from Dave on BiggerPockets on the market podcast. Coming up after the break, Andy Cross and Jason Moser return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.

Ron Gross here with Andy Cross and Jason Moser. Fools, we have time for two quick stories before we hit stocks on our radar. Prices of sriracha, if I say that correctly, the spicy ketchup like sauce are as high as $70 on eBay and $124 on Amazon. Huy Fong Foods has been struggling with a years-long shortage of the chilis that are used to make the sauce which is hurting production and causing some shortages. Gentlemen, thoughts. Are you a fan of this product? Would you pay up for this product?
Andy Cross: Big fan. I have it in my fridge now. I don't know that I'm going to pay up for it. The thing is funny. These things feed on themselves. They're like runs on banks. [laughs] The more these thing is published, the more panic it creates, and it bids that price up and up and up. But I tell you, it's a good sauce. I use it on its own and also as ingredient for other sauces.
Jason Moser: I got a bottle sitting in my closet that I don't think. If you need some, you know where to call.
Ron Gross: Sticking with the theme, on Independence Day, Pepsi will unveil Pepsi Colachup, which is perhaps exactly what you're thinking it is. Ketchup infused, yes, with Pepsi. Guys, I got to say on a hamburger or a hotdog, it may not be ridiculous.
Jason Moser: Maybe not. I have heard of soda in barbecue sauces before, Stubbs and Dr. Pepper, for example. Stubbs is owned by McCormick, by the way. Throw that in there. Really what this boils down that reminds me the beginning of the season here, I need to go ahead and make up a new match. My big daddies boy, howdy mustard sauce. [laughs] We just call it the house sauce at home. It's that recipe that I made up. We talked about it before on the show, Ron, and maybe as we celebrate freedom this year, maybe I should celebrate by giving that recipe out finally, after all these years.
Ron Gross: You can add some like Mr. Pibb or Dr. Pepper to it.
Jason Moser: No, it just doesn't require.
Andy Cross: I'm waiting for the Mountain Dew-infused mayonnaise, and I'm going to drop off a bottle at Ron's house.
Jason Moser: You need to build up an IPA barbecue sauce.
Ron Gross: Fools, it's time for a couple of stocks on our radar, and I'll bring in our man, Dan Boyd, to ask a question and pick his favorite. Jason Moser, you're up first. What do you got?
Jason Moser: I've been keeping an eye on Amazon, ticker AMZN, and I think this is just a story to watch play out over these next several weeks. We get the FTC planning to file a suit targeting Amazon's core online marketplace in the coming weeks. This is something that has been a long time coming. The main allegation by the FTC is that Amazon uses its power to reward the online merchants that use its logistics service and punish the ones that don't. Now if that's true, that certainly doesn't sound right. So it's going to be interesting to see how this really goes. They've also got the FTC investigating Amazon's deal to buy Roomba. We're looking at actions being taken against [Alphabet's] Google, obviously Microsoft Activision Blizzard on the microscope. Just it's a tough time to be big.
Andy Cross: Amazon, you say? Am I pronouncing it correctly? I'm not familiar with it.
Jason Moser: Newfangled company. You'll hear more about it.
Andy Cross: In England, they pronounce it Amazon.
Ron Gross: Dan, a question from you.
Dan Boyd: Yeah, sure. So Amazon is one of these companies that has its claws in every part of everyday life for the majority of Americans, at least. Is anything the FTC going to do to disrupt that, or are they going to sit back and continue to be one of the most important companies in our economy?
Jason Moser: I have a feeling they're not going to be able to do a whole heck of a lot. It just remains to be seen. These things are always so tricky, and typically companies, they negotiate ways to spin things off or sell little pieces off to appease regulators. But time will tell.
Dan Boyd: Andy, you're up. What are you looking at?
Andy Cross: Let's go from a 1.3. trillion-dollar company to a 1.2 billion-dollar company. Dan, this is a very small company, so tread carefully. It's Winmark, symbol W-I-N-A. It operates as a franchisor of five secondhand resale brands like Play It Again Sports, Plato's Closet, which is for teens, Once Upon A Child, children's cloths, Style Encore, women's clothing, and Dan, Music Go Round, musical instruments, secondhand, you can buy. It also owns a little technology leasing arm. It has nearly 1300 franchises in the US and Canada that sign 10-year lease terms and pay franchise and royalty fees 4-5% of the sales. As a franchisor, Winmark provides services and support to their franchise partners, like marketing and technology, e-commerce. Since 2010, they've recycled almost 1.6 million products. They get a second life as part of another user, and that's more than 450 items per day. Such speaks a little bit to the sustainability play here. Winmark speaks really to the interest of consumers in reusing and recycling products to support that more sustainable lifestyle rather than having to buy a bunch of new products from a store. That takes a lot more energy to make. This whole thing creates a really outstanding business model, Dan, 94% gross margins, 60% plus operating margins, and 40% plus free cash flow margins, with not a lot of assets, really only 40 million of assets for an 80 million in sales and 40 million in profits. So a single-digit grower, but it's increased the dividend more than 40% annualized for the past few yea rs, Winmark, W-I-N-A. Dan?
Dan Boyd: I was independently, of this podcast, looking at this stock to purchase this week already. I love this stock as a dad. I love buying things secondhand. It is a great way to get good products on the cheap. So I'm a big fan of Winmark Corporation.
Andy Cross: The stock is up 40% and sells at 35 times free cash flow. So it is a little bit pricey, so maybe just wait for a little pullback.
Ron Gross: But do you have a favorite, Dan? I think I know the answer to this. Little known Amazon or Winmark?
Jason Moser: Go Winmark, Ron.
Ron Gross: Andy Cross, Jason Moser, thanks for being here. That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money. Our engineer is Dan Boyd. I'm Ron Gross. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week.

2023-07-10 00:00:00+00:00,Is iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (IUSG) a Strong ETF Right Now?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-ishares-core-sp-u.s.-growth-etf-iusg-a-strong-etf-right-now-8,"Making its debut on 07/24/2000, smart beta exchange traded fund iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (IUSG) provides investors broad exposure to the Style Box - All Cap Growth category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.
On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $13.59 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs in the Style Box - All Cap Growth. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the S&P 900 Growth Index before fees and expenses.
The S&P 900 Growth Index measures the performance of the large and mid-capitalization growth sector of the U.S. equity market.
Cost & Other Expenses
Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.
Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.04% for this ETF, which makes it one of the least expensive products in the space.
It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 1%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
It is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
For IUSG, it has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector --about 35.30% of the portfolio --while Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.
When you look at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 12.69% of the fund's total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA).
The top 10 holdings account for about 40.17% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF has gained about 18.94% and is up about 11.21% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 07/10/2023), respectively. IUSG has traded between $78.88 and $99.02 during this last 52-week period.
IUSG has a beta of 1.05 and standard deviation of 22.12% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 476 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
IShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - All Cap Growth segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.
IShares Morningstar U.S. Equity ETF (ILCB) tracks MORNINGSTAR US LARGE-MID CAP INDEX and the iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (ILCG) tracks MORNINGSTAR US LARGE-MID CP BRD GRWTH ID. IShares Morningstar U.S. Equity ETF has $779.55 million in assets, iShares Morningstar Growth ETF has $1.74 billion. ILCB has an expense ratio of 0.03% and ILCG charges 0.04%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - All Cap Growth.

2023-07-11 00:00:00+00:00,2 Semiconductor Stocks To Watch In Mid-July 2023,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-semiconductor-stocks-to-watch-in-mid-july-2023,"The semiconductor industry, foundational to the functioning of modern technology, has been experiencing considerable growth and attention in recent years. Semiconductors, or small chips function as the brain for various devices from smartphones and computers to vehicles and appliances. They are a vital part of our digitized society. Factors such as technological advancements, increased digitalization, and the growing need for smart, connected devices have contributed to the sector’s expansion.
The industry’s potential has led to an increasing interest in semiconductor stocks as an investment option.

2023-07-13 00:00:00+00:00,3 Semiconductor Stocks That AI Is Loving in July,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-semiconductor-stocks-that-ai-is-loving-in-july,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Semiconductors devices are crucial to the modern digital economy. These tiny electronics power everything from our smartphones and personal computers to cars, commercial airplanes and cloud servers. Therefore, if you are a public equities investor looking for high-growth opportunities, semiconductor stocks have to be in your portfolio. Still, choosing a semiconductor stock that would provide the best returns is not easy. The semiconductor sector remains crowded, and there are geopolitics and supply chain bottlenecks to consider. Ultimately, the companies that will come out on top will have to be at the forefront of innovation.
To help me create this list, I have decided to turn to one of the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots birthed during this year’s AI craze: Bing ChatGPT. Below is a list of semiconductor stocks that Bing ChatGPT thinks are worth targeting this month.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the semiconductor company on everyone’s lips in 2023 due to its focus on not just gaming, but also artificial intelligence. After selling off 48% in 2022, shares of Nvidia have rallied nearly 195% YTD, making it the best-performing chip stock in the market in 2023. Nvidia is the leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are essential for rendering realistic images and videos in games, as well as accelerating AI applications in data centers, cloud computing, autonomous vehicles and more.
Most recently, Nvidia’s A100 and H100 chips have helped power the elaborate large language models (LLMs) used to train the conversational AI chat-bots released this year, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Both of these new GPU sets are based on the company’s Ampere and Hopper architectures, respectively. These novel architectures offer significant performance improvements over the previous generations.
Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to grow its non-GAAP earnings by 134% in 2024, driven by strong demand for its AI-powering GPU products. This gives more than enough reason to keep the GPU maker in your portfolio for the long run.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is another chip stock that has benefited from the growth of gaming and data center markets. AMD competes with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the central processing unit (CPU) market, where it has gained market share with its Ryzen and Epyc processors that offer better performance and value than Intel’s counterparts. AMD also competes with Nvidia in the GPU market, where it has launched its own products based on its RDNA 2 architecture, which power the latest gaming consoles from Sony (NASDAQ:SNE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as well as high-end PCs. However, AMD’s latest and, perhaps, most crucial battleground with Nvidia is in the realm of AI. Last month, AMD announced the MI300x GPU which will compete directly with Nvidia’s A100 and H100 chips. If AMD can price competitively, there could be a clear opportunity for the company to capture market share.
This year, AMD has seen its shares soar 77% YTD, eclipsing Intel’s 22% gain. Analysts have an average 12-month price target of $132.63, implying a nearly 17% gain. Market-watchers should pay special to attention to how AMD rolls out its new AI chips. Traction for these products could spell immense upward potential for the company’s shares.
NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)

NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) is a chip stock that has exposure to the automotive and Internet of Things (IoT) markets, which are expected to see continued growth in the coming years. The Dutch semiconductor giant is one of the largest suppliers of chips for cars, especially electric vehicles (EVs), which require more semiconductors than traditional cars for functions such as battery management. In 2022, revenues came in at $13.21 billion with NXP’s automotive segment representing 52.1% or $6.88 billion. Revenue growth for the automotive segment was up more than 25% YoY and was aided by strong demand and price inflation. NXP also provides chips for IoT devices such as smart home appliances, wearables, industrial equipment and more. Revenues for this segment were up 13% YoY at $2.71 billion. Similarly, NXP’s Q1’2023 revenues came in better than expected due to tailwinds in the company’s automotive segment.
NXP has seen its shares rise more than 35% YTD, despite facing some headwinds from the global chip shortage that has affected the automotive industry. Wall Street analysts expect NXP to grow its earnings by 8.56% in 2024, driven by the recovery of car demand and the expansion of IoT applications.

NVIDIA Declares $0.04 Dividend
On May 24, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share ($0.16 annualized). Shareholders of record as of June 8, 2023 received the payment on June 30, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.04 per share.
At the current share price of $459.77 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.03%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.18%, the lowest has been 0.02%, and the highest has been 0.50%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.13 (n=236).
The current dividend yield is 1.17 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.09. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

July 17 (Reuters) - The U.S.-based Semiconductor Industry Association trade group on Monday called on the Biden administration to ""refrain from further restrictions"" on chip sales to China as chief executives from the biggest U.S. semiconductor firms planned to visit Washington this week to press their views on China policy.
The statement came as the Biden administration considers updating a sweeping set of rules imposed in October to hobble China's chip industry and a new executive order restricting some outbound investment. Reuters reported last week that the chief executives of Intel Corp INTC.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.Oplanned to meet with government officials to discuss their views on China policy.
The statement also comes after China moved to restrict exports of raw materials such as gallium and germanium that are used in making chips. The industry group said that further rule-tightening by U.S. officials risks ""disrupting supply chains, causing significant market uncertainty, and prompting continued escalatory retaliation by China.""
The industry group said it wants ""the administration to refrain from further restrictions until it engages more extensively with industry and experts to assess the impact of current and potential restrictions to determine whether they are narrow and clearly defined, consistently applied, and fully coordinated with allies.”

2023-07-18 00:00:00+00:00,1 Green Flag and 1 Red Flag for AI Stocks,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-green-flag-and-1-red-flag-for-ai-stocks,"What's been the best way to grow a stock portfolio in 2023? Halfway through the year, the answer is clear -- own some artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), for example, is up a staggering 211% year to date. With those sorts of eye-popping returns, many investors want to know: Is it now too late to buy AI stocks?
So, let's have a look at one green flag and one red flag for the hottest sector in the stock market.

Green flag: We've only seen the tip of the iceberg
Unsurprisingly, there are plenty of reasons to be bullish on AI stocks, and AI generally. The mania that surrounded ChatGPT back in March spread far beyond financial circles and entered the cultural mainstream. Much of the hype has centered on AI-created art or language, but there's more to AI than just chatbots and photo generators.
AI can create efficiencies in multiple industries, from optimizing agricultural techniques to streamlining vehicle assembly lines. Cybersecurity firms like CrowdStrike use AI to monitor and secure client networks. Financial companies like Visa (NYSE: V) use AI to monitor transactions and root out fraud.
Granted, scientists, politicians, and artists have all chimed in with concerns about how AI may alter or disrupt industries and usher in negative consequences. However, AI is here to stay. That's because AI will alter the competitive landscape in favor of companies that use AI and the innovations it makes possible. Alternatively, companies that resist AI will likely see their competitive advantages erode.
Red flag: Valuations have become stretched
There are also downsides to this year's AI stock rally. The most obvious example is that stock prices have risen much faster than earnings for several AI-related stocks.
Take Nvidia, for example. The stock has rallied from around $145 to nearly $455 today. However, earnings haven't kept pace. That explains why Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has skyrocketed from 60x to 235x.
Nvidia is the clearest example, but this same process is playing out with other AI stocks. In short, these stocks have rallied thanks to their potential rather than their results. And that's a recipe for a pullback if earnings fall short of expectations or if guidance disappoints.
Is it too late to buy AI stocks?
It's common for growth-oriented investors to find themselves in this position: On the one hand, AI is a game-changing technology that will usher in staggering innovation and efficiency. On the other, many of the stocks best positioned to benefit from the AI revolution have already rallied significantly, and their valuations are sky-high.
There are, however, many companies that will reap enormous benefits from AI but remain attractively priced. For example, Visa.
As I noted earlier, the company has already integrated AI into its fraud detection monitoring and also uses machine learning to thwart cyberattacks. Visa trades at a P/E ratio of 33, which is below its five-year average of 36. Moreover, analysts expect Visa to earn $8.60 per share this year -- up from $7.50 last year. As the company's AI efficiencies grow, it's possible Visa could increase its already impressive 51% net profit margin. That's well ahead of rival Mastercard, which has a 42% profit margin.
AI stocks like Nvidia might be too hot to handle for some, but for investors willing to dig beneath the surface, there are plenty of AI stocks that remain screaming buys. You just have to know where to look.

Just a handful of months ago, former tech darlings crashed, recession fears brewed, and new layoffs were announced on a seemingly daily basis. To make matters worse, the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates viciously to tamp down rampant inflation – triggering an unforeseen spat of bankruptcies in the regional banking sector.
Fast forward to 2023, and the Nasdaq is off to its most robust start to a year in its 52-year history. Though participation has recently broadened, the equity index star thus far is the Nasdaq 100 Index ETF (QQQ). QQQ, which contains large-cap tech darlings like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), is up a scorching 45% year-to-date and is knocking on the door of all-time highs. Meanwhile, stocks like Meta Platforms (META), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) are each up more than 150% for the year (NVDA is up a mind-blowing 228%).

What Now?
Once again, equity markets have successfully climbed the proverbial “Wall of Worry”. However, few investors and analysts saw a bull market coming, let alone this magnitude of returns. Regardless of whether you’ve caught the bull market, there is little value in “Monday morning quarterbacking.” An old Wall Street saying warns, “You’re only as good as your next trade.” With that sentiment in mind, today I will lay out 5 tips on how to handle a raging bull market.
5 Tips on How to Handle a Raging Bull Market
If you missed the move, don’t chase it. Investing is a highly emotional endeavor. Seeing your neighbor or friend making money in the market may trigger your “Fear of Missing Out” instinct. However, the only thing worse than missing a move is chasing a move and compounding your mistakes. Remember, stocks will pull back eventually and test their 50-day moving average, an area with favorable reward-to-risk in uptrends. With the QQQ stretched 9% above the 50-day moving average, now is not the time to chase.

If you’re already long, know your time frame and strategy. When it comes to selling winners, there is no right or wrong method, and there are multiple ways to “skin the cat”. For example, you can sell into strength, use a trailing stop, or wait for a moving average break. What’s critical for investors is to be cognizant of what happens in a worse-case scenario. Ask yourself, “What would happen if the market pulled back 10% from here?”. Do you have a plan? Also, ensure that you’re not over-exposed to one particular industry group. Typically, stocks within an industry group are highly correlated and will pull back simultaneously.

Conversely, don’t be short just because something is up a lot. Carvana (CVNA) is up more than 1,000% year-to-date. While it might be tempting to short a name like CVNA, it is important to remember that trends often last longer than most expect. Think back to GameStop (GME) in 2020 and 2021. While it may have been tempting to short, the stock ran from $1 to $100!

GME’s move was so spectacular that multi-billion-dollar hedge fund Melvin Capital blew up due to its short position. Remember, “Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”
Have cash on hand and build a watchlist of stocks to buy on pullbacks. As I mentioned, trends tend to persist much longer than most anticipate. The average bull market lasts roughly four years, so remember, the trend is your friend. What separates savvy investors from amateurs is the ability to wait for“your pitch.” Like a lion waiting to pounce on its prey, wait for big winners like Microsoft (MSFT) to pull back to logical support areas.

Pay attention to “price action versus news” and sentiment. Equity markets tend to price in the news ahead of time. For example, in late 2022, US equities bottomed the day inflation hit its highest level in 40 years. In other words, despite the “bad” news, markets priced in the future.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
On Wednesday, Apple shares spiked intraday on news that the largest US company is rushing to develop its own generative AI tools to compete with OpenAI. Though the news was “good”, the stock backed off into the close of the session – a sign that Apple and the market may need to pull back.

Furthermore, the NAAIM Exposure Index, a sentiment gauge representing the average exposure to US equity markets, is at its most bullish level since late last year.

George Patton once said, “If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn’t thinking.”
Conclusion
In a raging bull market, investors best serve themselves by exuding patience, managing emotions, and implementing common-sense measures. If you don’t have a plan, get one and follow it. Avoid getting caught up in the bull market hysteria.

With businesses and countries across the world elevating artificial intelligence (AI) to enjoy higher revenue and growth, investors are also on the lookout for AI stocks that have massive upside potential. Self-driving cars, robotics, gaming or machine learning, you name it and AI is present there. It has become a part of every industry and is only going to expand in the coming years. If you look at the potential of AI, we are just scratching the surface right now. According to PWC, AI can contribute $15.7 trillion to the economy by 2030. The report also states that the greatest economic gains from AI will be in China, followed by North America. 
While AI is everywhere, not every company that invests in it is set to benefit. If you are thinking of investing in AI, you need to keep in mind that there are only a few companies that offer solid growth opportunities and have a positive long-term outlook. Here are three AI stocks to buy for getting rich in 2023.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), an extremely powerful company, is leading the AI race and is at the forefront with its powerful technology. While the stock might look expensive right now, with Nvidia, you will get what you pay for. It is trading at $474 today and is up over 200% since the beginning of the year. One of the high potential AI stocks, NVDA stock started the year at $143 and has now hit $474, making several investors rich. 
The company is growing at a ridiculously rapid pace and reported a revenue of $7 billion in the first quarter. It has invested heavily into AI and with the rising demand of its chip powered applications, Nvidia is going to see higher growth in the next few years. The company isn’t at the top today but is on the road to massive success. There was a point of time when gaming was the biggest source of revenue for the company. It then moved toward the data center and despite a drop in gaming revenue, the company continues to see steady growth in the data center segment. It produced a revenue of $4.28 billion while the gaming segment produced $2.24 billion. 
With the increase of generative AI applications, the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) is on the rise – and Nvidia has the power to increase the prices as well. The company recently invested $50 million in Recursion, which led to the recent stock rally. It is a company that specializes in accelerated computing and this investment will allow it to work on AI models of Chemistry and Biology. Currently, it is difficult to dethrone Nvidia, and if you are looking for AI stocks to invest in this year, buy NVDA. 
Microsoft (MSFT)

There is nobody unaware of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and its products. It has become difficult to run a business without using at least one of Microsoft’s products. If you are considering tech industry investing, Microsoft is the one to pick. The numbers are proof of how well Microsoft is doing. It reported a revenue of $52.9 billion and a net income of 18.3 billion, both better than the same quarter the previous year. Already an early investor in AI, the company’s Intelligent Cloud Segment shined through and brought in $22.1 billion in revenue.
Besides the investment in OpenAI, Microsoft is also developing its own AI chip named Athena. This chip will have the ability to power the technology behind AI chatbots. By producing chips, the company will be able to save money that goes into buying chips from other vendors. If the chips perform well, it will put Microsoft into direct competition with Nvidia. 
MSFT stock is not cheap – it is exchanging hands at $359 today and is already up 50% year to date. Despite being expensive, the future of this stock looks bright. It has generated over 200% returns in the past five years. The stock surged after the company announced that it will charge $30 a month for its generative AI features. This fee will boost the company’s revenue in the near-term. In a recent memo, the company stated that it plans to grow its revenue by at least 10% through 2030 and this means it will be able to generate over $500 billion in revenue by the end of this decade. If it hits this target, we will see the stock hit a new all-time high. Microsoft is set to announce results next week and the stock could move higher then. 
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

It is not possible to talk about AI stocks without mentioning Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The company is a direct competitor of Nvidia and is here to challenge its dominance. If you think NVDA stock is too expensive, consider investing in AMD stock because it has the potential to reach the same highs. The company is already succeeding with its chips and its recently revealed MI300 is here to change the way cloud data centers run AI applications. The performance of this chip drew Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) attention – and they could be using it for Amazon Web Services very soon. This could give a huge boost to the stock. 
Another reason to bet on AMD is its diversified business model. The company has revenue flowing in from multiple streams and it could also use AI for gaming, potentially transforming the gaming experience of every user. AMD stock is trading at $117 today and is up 84% year to date.  The company has strong financials and it reported a quarterly revenue of $5.4 billion – a 9% year-over-year drop; however, I believe this loss is only temporary. It will be interesting to see the second-quarter results from the company. AMD has all it takes to inch closer to Nvidia and has a solid leadership that can make it happen, too. It isn’t too far behind and if you want to get rich, AMD stock is definitely one to own.

NVIDIA Declares $0.04 Dividend
On May 24, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share ($0.16 annualized). Shareholders of record as of June 8, 2023 received the payment on June 30, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.04 per share.
At the current share price of $443.09 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.04%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.18%, the lowest has been 0.02%, and the highest has been 0.50%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.13 (n=236).
The current dividend yield is 1.15 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.09. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

2023-07-25 00:00:00+00:00,How to Find Top-Ranked Stocks to Buy Heading into August,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-to-find-top-ranked-stocks-to-buy-heading-into-august,"Wall Street spent the first day and a half of a busy week sending stocks higher despite the unknowns right around the corner. The buying appears to showcase that investors are growing more confident that the Fed will hike by 0.25% on Wednesday and then be finished with their hawkish tightening efforts.
The other most important factor driving stock prices, earnings, are also ready to turn the corner according to Zacks data. The second quarter is set to mark the bottom for earnings, with Q3 ready to dip slightly. S&P 500 earnings are then projected to bounce back in a huge way in the fourth quarter and not look back in 2024 or 2025.
In the forward-looking world of Wall Street, the end of tightening and a soon-to-be earnings rebound has helped propel the fantastic first half and a strong July. That said, it is very possible the market experiences plenty more post-release selloffs and profit taking, similar to Tesla and Netflix last week.

Despite the possibility of near-term volatility and selling, the foundation supporting the bull market appears intact. Even one of Wall Street’s biggest bears, Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson, recently admitted that he was ‘wrong’ about the 2023 stock market.
With this in mind, investors can utilize the Filtered Zacks Rank 5 Stock Screen to help find potentially winning stocks heading into August and beyond that have boosted their earnings guidance.
Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks outperform the market in both good and bad times. However, there are over 200 stocks that earn a Zacks Rank #1 at any given time. Therefore, it’s helpful to understand how to apply filters to the Zacks Rank in order to narrow the list down to a more manageable and tradable set of stocks.
Parameters
Clearly, there are only three items on this screen. But together, these three filters can result in some impressive returns.
• Zacks Rank equal to 1
Starting with a Zacks Rank #1 is often a strong jumping off point because it boasts an average annual return of roughly 24.4% per year since 1988.
• % Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0
Positive current quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.
• % Broker Rating Change over 4 Week equal to Top # 5
Top 5 stocks with the best average broker rating changes over the last four weeks.
This strategy comes loaded with the Research Wizard and is called bt_sow_filtered zacks rank5. It can be found in the SoW (Screen of the Week) folder.
Here are two of the five stocks that qualified for the Filtered Zacks Rank 5 strategy today…
Cadence Design Systems (CDNS)
Cadence Design posted a beat-and-raise quarter on Tuesday morning, July 25. Cadence is a leader in electronic systems design. Its modeling and computational software helps in the design process of semiconductors and many other crucial and cutting-edge technologies that drive the economy.
Cadence’s earnings revisions chart highlights its impressive growth over the last few years and what is likely to come in the coming years. CDNS currently lands a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), but that ranking could change as more analysts provide updated results following its Q2 earnings release on Tuesday.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Cadence boasts Nvidia (NVDA) as a key customer because the GPU giant loves its modeling and simulation capabilities. Cadence is one of two major players in its realm and CDNS is more vital than ever as the chips venture into the sub-5 nanometer world. Plus, Cadence is benefiting from the AI boom.
Cadence shares have destroyed the Zacks Tech sector over the last decade and the past 12 months, up 1,500% and 40% respectively to trade near fresh highs. CDNS shares were down around 1.2% through morning trading following its release as investors start to utilize earnings as an opportunity to take home profits on Cadence and other 2023 stars.
Cadence is now flirting with its 21-day moving average and sitting about 5% below its recent records. CDNS is far from cheap in terms of forward earnings, but it trades at a 26% discount to its own decade-long highs and its PEG ratio of 2.8 marks a 52% discount to its highs. Plus, 10 of the 12 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys.” All that said, some investors might want to wait for more of a pullback, while others with long-term outlooks could avoid the market-timing game.
Boise Cascade (BCC)
Boise Cascade is one of the top producers of engineered wood products and plywood in North America. Boise Cascade is also a huge player in the wholesale distribution of building products in the U.S. BCC posted an impressive stretch of top-line expansion over the last decade, highlighted by 18% growth in 2020 and 45% expansion in 2021, driven by the Covid housing and home improvement boom. Boise Cascade followed that up with another 6% sales growth last year.
Despite higher rates and a slowing economy, U.S. housing starts are rebounding. And Boise Cascade is prepared to benefit from long-term demographic trends and the ongoing undersupply of single-family homes that have kept housing demand high. Plus, homebuilders didn’t overbuild during Covid, which leaves plenty of near-term and long-term upside.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Clearly, Boise Cascade was going to find it nearly impossible to follow its recent stretch. But BCC topped our Q1 EPS estimate by 34% and its earnings outlook, which had held steady, is starting to improve for fiscal 2023 and FY24. Boise Cascade’s Q2 earnings estimate has jumped 12% in the last few months, with FY24’s outlook 14% higher.
Boise Cascade’s Building Products – Wood products industry is currently in the top 15% of over 250 Zacks industries. And the company’s balance sheet is very impressive, with $1 billion in cash and equivalents and $3.4 billion in total assets vs. $580 million in current liabilities and $1.2 billion in total liabilities. The company’s dividend currently yields 0.6%, with a tiny 4% payout ratio that offers big long-term upside.  
Boise Cascade is set to release its Q2 results on Tuesday, August 1.

2023-07-26 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia's Newest Service Makes It Easier Than Ever to Train AI -- What Investors Need to Know,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidias-newest-service-makes-it-easier-than-ever-to-train-ai-what-investors-need-to-know,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the company traditionally known for designing chips for high-end video game graphics on PCs, has ushered in a new era of AI. The generative AI chatbot ChatGPT quickly picked up tens of millions of users starting in late 2022, creating ballooning interest in other generative AI services -- nearly all of which are ""trained"" using Nvidia semiconductor systems.
What followed was an epic financial report unlike anything seen before. Cloud infrastructure companies are all scrambling to buy as many AI training chips as they can get their hands on. But Nvidia has a new way to access its hardware that makes AI easier and more affordable to train than ever before: DGX Cloud.
Wait, what is generative AI?
Let's get up to speed on what generative AI services like ChatGPT are. AI-powered software has been around for decades, quietly working behind the scenes to do things like organize and present information on the internet or auto-fill words while users type in a word document.
Generative AI is a newer sub-field of artificial intelligence in which computer software is used to ""create"" new content. There are lots of iterations of it. It could be a user typing in text to prompt the AI to create more text (known as text-to-text), a text-to-image or text-to-video prompt that creates new visuals, image-to-video, video-to-text, or really any iteration that can be imagined. Generative AI is even used to translate speech in real time, power self-driving cars, and even to create software code, with the user explaining what they want the software to do using simple everyday language.

Nvidia opens the door to new possibilities
The software algorithms that can accomplish this content creation (known as large language models, or LLMs) first need to be ""trained."" This is where Nvidia comes in. Using massive amounts of data, like that found on the internet or from a company's own private digital information, the LLM algorithms are trained in how to respond to user prompts by tracking relationships in sequential data, be it text in a sentence or sequential frames of video.
Nvidia helped pioneer this work with over a decade and a half of research and development into data center supercomputing. Its video game chips (GPUs, or graphics processing units) can shred through massive amounts of data, so the company figured out how to apply these GPUs to data centers (a data center becomes part of ""the cloud"" when data and software stored on it is accessed via an internet connection).
However, up to this point, a company or start-up that wanted to train generative AI would need to purchase and install a great deal of data center infrastructure. This can get ridiculously expensive. Nvidia's latest flagship system alone, called the H100, can cost upward of $40,000 -- and that's just one piece of the infrastructure needed for AI training! A DGX SuperPod (which utilizes many H100s along with other chips) reportedly starts at about $7 million and can cost as much as $60 million.

DGX Cloud aims to solve this problem. Rather than a company needing to purchase and set up its own expensive data center, it can now rent access to Nvidia's AI training infrastructure and related software on a monthly basis. After testing early access with some early adopter businesses, DGX Cloud is now broadly available via subscription to Oracle's Cloud and through Nvidia's own infrastructure in the U.S. and U.K.
A game changer for Nvidia
Generative AI can have transformative use cases across all industries of the global economy. Some research points toward AI soon adding $4 trillion in economic value every year. It's difficult to quantify what exactly that means, but the early results are quite tangible for Nvidia. The company reported revenue of $7.2 billion in its last quarter, but anticipates revenue to be some $4 billion more in the next quarter alone (to about $11 billion in total quarterly sales) due mostly to generative AI infrastructure demand.
While management didn't provide specific guidance for the second half of the current fiscal year, CFO Colette Kress said Nvidia has ""procured substantially higher supply for the second half of the year"" from its manufacturing partners. Suffice to say Nvidia's revenue is poised to rocket to new all-time highs this year and next. Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently doled out praise for Nvidia, saying the electric vehicle leader would take as many Nvidia GPUs as it could get, but that Nvidia has many other customers it has to prioritize, too.
This explains the wild optimism surrounding Nvidia stock right now. Shares trade for well over 40 times Wall Street analysts' expectations for next year's earnings. It's a premium price tag to be sure, so investors should tread carefully. There's limited visibility on just how much money Nvidia is going to haul in from its generative AI infrastructure, let alone its brand new DGX Cloud subscription service. But one thing's for sure: Nvidia has ushered in a new era of AI, and it's well positioned to continue carrying the torch for this movement for years to come.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Home Depot, Inc. (HD), Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

Shares of Home Depot have lagged rival Lowe's (+4.3% vs. +17.5%) and the broader market (+4.3% vs. +20.1% for the S&P 500 index) in the year-to-date peirod, reflecting worries about the retailer's exposure to cyclical forces.
That said, the company has been witnessing significant benefits from the execution of the “One Home Depot” investment plan, which focuses on expanding supply chain facilities, technology investments and enhancement to the digital experience.

The interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have helped consistently boost web traffic for the past few quarters. The company remains on track with its strategic investments to build a Pro ecosystem.

However, HD posted dismal first-quarter fiscal 2023 performance. Results were impacted by a more broad-based pressure across the business, driven by softened demand versus expectations. A deflation in lumber prices and unfavorable weather have also hurt the results. HD also provided a conservative view for fiscal 2023.

Shares of Philip Morris have outperformed the Zacks Tobacco industry over the past year (+7.0% vs. +5.0%). The company has been benefiting from its solid pricing power. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance in the second quarter of 2023 and is likely to remain a driver.

A focus on reduced-risk products, especially IQOS, has been working well for the company, which is witnessing a continued product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products. These upsides are likely to boost organic revenues in the full-year 2023.

However, Philip Morris has been battling cost-related headwinds. The company expects to make additional growth-oriented investments in 2023, which may impact margins. Also, soft cigarette shipment volumes and volatile currency movements have been concerns. In full-year 2023, cigarette shipment volumes are expected to decline by 1.5-2.5%.

Shares of IBM have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+15.7% vs. +12.3%). The company is witnessing solid net sales growth in the software segment driven by healthy hybrid cloud adoption and solid demand trends across RedHat, automation, data in AI and security.

Strong foundation of research and innovation, a broad portfolio that caters to various industry requirements and diverseglobal marketpresence set it apart from its competitors. IBM is also poised to benefit from the Watsonx platform.

However, declining trends in the infrastructure vertical are hurting top-line growth. Intense competition from other established players in cloud services is putting pressure on margins. A highly-leveraged balance sheet and integration risk due to frequent acquisitions are other concerns.

2023-07-31 00:00:00+00:00,3 AI Chip Stocks That Still Have a Long Runway,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-ai-chip-stocks-that-still-have-a-long-runway,"Artificial intelligence (AI) means different things to different industries. For investors, it can be confusing and even a little suspicious, as companies are bending over backward to tout their AI capabilities to investors. 
That’s why a better way to invest in the growth of AI is to invest in semiconductor stocks. Semiconductor chips are the backbone of AI. From robotics to autonomous driving to data analysis, demand for processing power and speed will be precedented to fuel the growth of AI.  
And this growth will be measured in years and perhaps decades. So it’s possible that investors are at the beginning of a super cycle for chip stocks. To support that point of view, Grand View Research estimates the AI chip market could grow to $134.64 billion by 2027. That would be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9%.  
That’s why now is still a good time to invest in chip stocks. And the three stocks listed below all appear to have long runways for future growth.  
The Undisputed Leader Still Has Room to Run 
Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) is one of the success stories of 2023. However, with NVDA stock up 219% for the year as of this writing, many analysts are saying the top is in.  
They could be right, but at this time many analysts disagree. According to the Nvidia analyst ratings on MarketBeat, 10 analysts have boosted their price targets for NVDA stock. And all of those targets are above the stock’s price of $466.96 on July 31.  
Of course, there are no guarantees for Nvidia or any other chip stock. It’s possible that the economy could weaken sharply. If that occurred, it would likely slow demand for AI-related applications. But slowing is not the same as reversing. The move towards AI is real and will continue. There are simply too many areas of the economy that will drive demand for AI. And Nvidia is well-positioned in many of those sectors.  
If you’re buying stocks for the long haul, Nvidia is a name that you can safely buy and hold.  
An Emerging Competitor in a Key Niche 
Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) is a chipmaker best known for its role in the mobile device/5G space. The company is perhaps best known to investors as the company that supplies Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) with the chips for Apple’s iPhone’s.  
That business has been struggling. However, the growth story for Qualcomm is emerging as the company pushes into AI-driven sectors such as autonomous driving.  
In January, Qualcomm launched its Snapdragon Ride platform. These chips have the ability to provide anywhere from Level 1 to Level 5 autonomous capabilities. It’s worth noting that Qualcomm has already inked partnerships with several EV manufacturers.  
Qualcomm also has an appealing fundamental setup. The forward P/E ratio is around 20x and full-year earnings are expected to climb approximately 19%. But the current consensus price target only shows QCOM stock getting a lift of about 11%.  
This Chip Maker Looks Undervalued 
Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ: TER) is a peripheral play on the chip sector. Specifically, the company is involved in semiconductor testing, which is essential to ensuring that the end products perform as expected. While the company tests more than semiconductor chips it’s a significant part of the company's business.  
With that said, the company has been managing through a correction cycle in semiconductor testing over the past four quarters. But expected growth, particularly in areas like automotive, cloud computing, and edge AI applications to be significant drivers of growth in coming quarters.  
This correction cycle presents investors with an interesting setup. Teradyne reported earnings on July 25, 2023 and beat on both the top and bottom lines. Full-year earnings are expected to rise by over 55%. Yet, the consensus estimate as of this writing is for the stock to fall by over 16%. 
Something has to give. In the case of Teradyne the consensus target is likely to rise as more analysts weigh in on TER stock. According to the Teradyne analyst ratings on MarketBeat, two analysts have already raised their price targets and both of those targets are well above the consensus target.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2023-08-02 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Other AI Stocks Crumbled Today",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-microsoft-alphabet-and-other-ai-stocks-crumbled-today,"What happened
There's little question that the hard-charging market rebound this year is largely the result of excitement about recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). In the wake of their worst performance since 2008, the major market indexes are decidedly in rally mode so far in 2023, driven by the potential for widespread productivity gains courtesy of generative AI.
With that as a backdrop, semiconductor specialist Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) slumped 4.9%, enterprise software purveyor Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) fell 2.7%, and search giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) slipped 2.4%, as of 3:26 p.m. ET Wednesday.
While the downgraded debt rating for the U.S. no doubt contributed to the market's dour mood today, the quarterly financial results for another AI-centric company weren't as robust as some investors had hoped, helping fuel the pessimism.

So what
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) (also called AMD) reported its second-quarter results after the market close on Tuesday, and while the results were largely in line with expectations, some investors had hoped for more. The company generated revenue of $5.4 billion, down 18% year over year, and flat sequentially. This resulted in non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share (EPS) of $0.58, down 45%.
To put this in context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $5.3 billion and EPS of $0.57, so the results edged past Wall Street's expectations.
More eye-catching, however, was AMD's outlook, which left much to be desired. For the third quarter, management is guiding for revenue of $5.7 billion, up about 2% year over year and flat sequentially. Given the company's reliance on the gaming and consumer computing markets, the results were hardly surprising. Sales of graphics cards used by gamers have been in free fall for more than a year and while the market is expected to rebound in the back half of the year, the recovery hasn't yet materialized.
AMD's forecast stands in stark contrast to Nvidia, which reported the results of its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended April 30) back in May. Revenue of $7.2 billion declined 13% year over year, while adjusted EPS of $1.09 fell 20%. While the results themselves weren't much to write home about, the market was mesmerized by Nvidia's outlook.
For the second quarter, management said it expected revenue to grow 64% year over year and 53% sequentially, driven by strong and accelerating demand for its cutting-edge processors used for AI.
Given the high-profile boom for all things AI, investors had hoped AMD would issue robust guidance since it competes with Nvidia in the data center and AI chip markets, but that simply wasn't the case.
Now what
It's quite clear that AI has gone viral this year. Investors have been scooping up shares of anything AI-related with reckless and wild abandon. AMD's results were likely a wake-up call that not all AI stocks are created equal, and there will be a wide range of outcomes even for those businesses that adopt these cutting-edge algorithms.
Yet, today's wide-ranging sell-off also seems to miss the forest for the trees:
Nvidia has been keenly focused on developing semiconductor and software stacks designed to make the most of AI, while simultaneously speeding data around the data center ether. The company has established itself as the gold standard for AI processing.
Microsoft has long been a proponent of AI and was quick to recognize the opportunity, as evidenced by its $13 billion investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. The company is working to integrate the latest AI advancements across its vast software empire.
Alphabet's Google is also a pioneer in AI technology, creating the Google Brain neural network back in 2011 to develop advanced machine learning systems before AI was all the rage. The company has long used AI to improve its products and processes and is doing the same with generative AI.
Each of these companies is an industry leader in their own respect and is well positioned to profit from the AI revolution. It's also important to remember that the adoption of AI is expected to take place over the course of a decade, so there will be peaks and valleys in the results of even the most advanced AI companies.
From a valuation standpoint, Alphabet is the cheapest of the three, selling for just shy of 5 times next year's sales, while Microsoft and Nvidia are selling for multiples of 9 and 19, respectively. These valuations might deter risk-averse or value investors, so they won't be for everyone.
That said, for those with a decade or more to let the AI revolution play out, it's best to relax, sit back, and enjoy the ride.

NVIDIA Declares $0.04 Dividend
On May 24, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share ($0.16 annualized). Shareholders of record as of June 8, 2023 received the payment on June 30, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.04 per share.
At the current share price of $467.50 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.03%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.18%, the lowest has been 0.02%, and the highest has been 0.50%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.13 (n=236).
The current dividend yield is 1.15 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.09. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

2023-08-04 00:00:00+00:00,The 2 Best AI Stocks to Buy in August,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-2-best-ai-stocks-to-buy-in-august,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as one of the most compelling investing themes of 2023. Optimism about AI helped propel many U.S. tech stocks higher, with Nvidia (NVDA) joining the $1 trillion market cap club this year. 
The tech rally was broad-based, and the Nasdaq Composite ($NASX) had its best first-half performance in four decades. The index rose almost 32% over the period, and in absolute terms, the constituents added over $4 trillion in market cap.
www.barchart.com
In fairness, there were multiple factors – including the 2022 crash that made tech valuations appealing, as well as better-than-expected economic data – that helped propel tech stocks higher. However, it's impossible to overlook the AI factor, as investors overwhelmingly looked to tech stocks to play the emerging AI story.
Analysts Mixed on Artificial Intelligence
The market’s opinion on AI is somewhat mixed. On one hand, we have brokerages like Citi, which see a “euphoria” - while on the other hand, Wedbush analysts term the current climate as an “AI revolution.” 
Investors have reason to be apprehensive amid the rally in AI stocks. After all, we have seen several boom-and-bust cycles in “emerging industries” – including green energy, metaverse, and blockchain – over the last five years. While all of these “revolutionary” industries are still interesting long-term stories, all have undergone a shakeup as multiple players are now fighting for relevance, while others have gone out of business entirely.
However, AI is not exactly a new technology, and companies have used it alongside Machine Learning (ML) for years. This is certainly a pivotal year for AI, though, thanks to the popular reception for generative AI apps like ChatGPT.
Of course, like any other emerging industry, there will be winners and losers in AI, as well. That said, I believe Amazon (AMZN) and Nvidia look like two good plays on AI.
Nvidia: One of the Best Ways to Play AI
While a lot of tech giants, including Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), are working on generative AI, they have yet to fully monetize their investments. Revenue realization will be staggered, at best, for many of the companies that are working on AI.
It’s a different story for Nvidia, which designs and sells the GPUs underpinning some of the most widely used AI technology. Unlike most other tech companies, Nvidia has been an immediate beneficiary of the AI pivot, as demand for its chips has already skyrocketed. 
This was best highlighted in its fiscal Q1 2024 earnings release in May, where revenues of $7.19 billion easily exceeded the $6.52 billion analysts were expecting. Even more impressive, Nvidia's revenue guidance of $11 billion for the fiscal second quarter was over 50% higher than what analysts expected.
Wall Street analysts expect the company’s revenues to rise 61.2% and 29.2%, respectively, in the current and next fiscal years. Earnings are projected to rise 162% and 44% during each of these two years.
www.barchart.comNVDA's Not That Expensive Post-Rally
NVDA stock has tripled this year, so there are bound to be questions over its valuation. However, its forward 12-month price-to-earnings multiple of 47.8x is actually similar to its average over the last three years.
Also, apart from generative AI, Nvidia is also benefiting from the shift towards autonomous cars, and sees that business as a $300 billion opportunity.
To sum it up, I believe Nvidia is among the best ways to play the AI story, and the Santa Clara-based company could continue to reward investors over the long term.
Amazon: An Underappreciated AI Story
Amazon hasn’t seen the kind of rerating that some other AI plays have seen over the last six months. While the stock has rallied this year and is outperforming the markets, I believe there are still legs in the rally as markets start appreciating its AI business.
www.barchart.com
The company uses AI in several business functions, including its enterprise-focused Amazon Web Services (AWS), Alexa, logistics, as well as grocery stores.
During the company’s Q2 2023earnings call– where it posted better-than-expected earnings and provided upbeat guidance for Q3 – Amazon also extensively talked about its AI initiatives.
CEO Andy Jassy said that data is the “core” of AI while adding, “AWS not only has the broadest array of storage, database, analytics, and data management services for customers, it also has more customers and data store than anybody else.”
He added separately, “every single one of our businesses inside of Amazon, every single one has multiple generative AI initiatives going right now.”
Responding to an analyst question on the monetization of AI, Jassy said, “We're a few steps into a marathon in my opinion. I think it's going to be transformative, and I think it's going to transform virtually every customer experience that we know.”
AMZN's a Reasonably Valued AI Play
Amazon is a play on multiple high-growth and secular themes, including e-commerce, cloud, streaming, digital advertising, and AI.
The company’s Q2 earnings beat and strong Q3 guidance corroborate my view that Wall Street was a bit too pessimistic about Amazon’s revenue, as well as its profitability outlook.
I believe as the company starts integrating AI across its business functions, an initiative highlighted during the Q2earnings call it will not only be able to cut costs even further, but also improve the customer experience - which could eventually lead to higher revenues and profits in the coming quarters.
While Amazon might not be a pure-play AI stock in a strict sense, it's nonetheless among the best ways to play the AI story - and with a forward 12-month price-to-sales multiple of 2.24x running below the five-year average of nearly 3x, I find it reasonably valued at these levels.

2023-08-07 00:00:00+00:00,Investing in AI on a Budget: 3 Undervalued Stocks You Can’t Ignore,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investing-in-ai-on-a-budget%3A-3-undervalued-stocks-you-cant-ignore,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
We all know the importance of artificial intelligence, which actually undergirds the enormous value of budget AI investing. According to data compiled by Statista, the value of the digital intelligence industry recently hit almost $100 billion. However, analysts project that this figure may reach up to nearly $2 trillion by 2030. That’s reason enough to consider undervalued AI stocks.
However, it’s easier said than done to invest in AI on a budget. Not to pick on this enterprise but semiconductor firm Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) skyrocketed this year because its graphics processors undergird complex AI-based calculations. But because of the enormous demand, NVDA trades at roughly 233 times trailing earnings.
My question to you is, why bother paying so much for digital intelligence when you can get the same innovation for much cheaper? On that note, below are AI stocks you can’t ignore.
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)
Source: shutterstock.com/everything possible
Fundamentally, arguably the vast majority of people understand the powerful AI implications of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Sure, the internet and tech giant has been slow regarding its integration of an AI-based chatbot. Right now, OpenAI and ChatGPT runs the show. However, Alphabet’s Bard can eventually make up new ground thanks to the data mine associated with the underlying Google ecosystem.
Still, with all that being said, does GOOG translate as one of the budget AI investing ideas? It doesn’t seem like it at first because its earnings multiples tend to run on the high side. However, based on the 10-year discounted cash flow (DCF) model, the fair value of GOOG should be $147.50. In contrast, at time of writing, GOOG trades hands at $128.54.
As well, the company benefits from overall strong financial metrics. Backed by a stable balance sheet, Alphabet prints a three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 22.9%, outflanking nearly 74% of its peers. In addition, its consistent profitable, featuring a robust net margin of 21%. Therefore, it makes a great case for undervalued AI stocks.
IBM (IBM)
Source: shutterstock.com/Den Rise
If you really want to invest in AI on a budget, I’d really look into IBM (NYSE:IBM). Sure, it’s far less exciting of an enterprise than Nvidia, that goes without saying. Also, its performance on the charts isn’t exactly sending shivers down the competition. For all the talk about a new IBM embracing the future, shares have gained less than 2% since January start.
Nevertheless, under the framework of budget AI investing, “Big Blue” deserves closer inspection. Specifically, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 15.2. As a discount to projected earnings, IBM ranks better than 75.07% of the competition. In addition, IBM trades at 12.95x free cash flow. In contrast, the sector median clocks in at 24.95X.
Now, buying a “paper” discount doesn’t mean much if the enterprise doesn’t swing higher. I believe it will over the long run thanks to its Watson AI platform. Already, IBM has demonstrated the utility of Watson for real-world applications. Plus, the IBM brand offers a significant trust factor. Therefore, it’s one of the AI stocks you can’t ignore.
H&R Block (HRB)
Source: shutterstock.com/YAKOBCHUK V
At first glance, tax and accounting service provider H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) doesn’t seem like a natural candidate for budget AI investing. However, that would be a mistake. Early this year, the company announced an industry-first AI technology that enables Americans to find tax refunds that a competing tax software company’s program missed.
While accountants have a reputation for being boring, they can seriously lay down some fire on their rivals. To be fair, HRB has been slow this year, slipping nearly 4% since the January opener. However, over the long run, HRB should benefit from macro events like the growing transition to the gig economy. Since independent contractors feature different tax profiles than employees, the spiked complexity should boost the consultancy business.
Additionally, I appreciate under the context of undervalued AI stocks that the company flies under the radar. In my opinion, that’s great for you. Right now, the market prices HRB at a forward multiple of 8.27. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than nearly 93% of its peers.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares took many investors by surprise in 2023. Shares have more than tripled year to date and currently carry a 232 P/E ratio. The forward P/E ratio of 59 makes shares look more palatable, but most of the upside potential came and went for investors.
Shares may continue to go higher and reward long-term investors, but the stock’s nearly parabolic growth rate since October 2022 makes it prime for a correction. Even if that correction doesn’t come anytime soon, other AI stocks have more reasonable valuations and can have more gains ahead.
Artificial intelligence is changing the way companies operate and serve customers. This technology will create many winners in the stock market that can reward long-term investors. Add these three AI stocks to your watchlist in the search for the next Nvidia.
Super Micro Computer (SMCI)
Source: Belozersky / Shutterstock
Although Nvidia’s year-to-date gains have been impressive, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) shares have done better. SMCI stock more than quadrupled year to date, and the company’s preliminary earnings gave investors additional reasons to hold onto the stock.
The company’s guidance numbers comfortably exceeded prior guidance by wide margins. Fiscal Q4 guidance went from $1.7B-$1.9B to $2.15B-$2.18B. SMCI has experienced record orders with a rapidly growing backlog.
Although the company reported solid preliminary earnings, investors must look at a company’s valuation before buying shares. High growth makes a stock attractive, but it wouldn’t make much sense to buy a stock with a 1,000 P/E ratio.
Luckily, Super Micro Computer has a reasonable valuation, especially for a company with its growth potential. Shares currently trade at a 32 P/E ratio. Super Micro Computer’s AI infrastructure solutions help its clients develop and execute advanced AI and HPC applications. Its servers are critical for artificial intelligence and the metaverse.
Shares trade at a reasonable level, and the company’s growth is accelerating. The stock looks like one of the top picks in AI.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is one of the top semiconductor companies. The firm has many clients, including Nvidia and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has enabled roughly 85% of the worldwide semiconductor startup product prototypes.
Recent quarters of declining revenue and earnings have made the stock more affordable, heading into the AI boom. TSM shares currently trade at a 16 P/E ratio with a dividend yield approaching 2%.
Once revenue and earnings get back on track, shares can soar. The stock is down by more than 30% from its all-time high and faces headwinds. TSM has delivered an 18.6% earnings compounded annual growth rate since 1994. The company has faced more challenging headwinds in the past and has been very rewarding for long-term investors. The rising demand for AI combined with a low valuation makes TSM a worthy AI stock to watch.
Symbotic (SYM)
Source: Phonlamai Photo / Shutterstock.com
Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) shares have gained more value than Super Micro Computer shares on a year-to-date basis. The 345% year-to-date gain is a sight to behold. Let’s look at the force driving the momentum.
Symbotic’s AI products and software help clients reimagine the supply chain and oversee the flow of inventory. Walmart is one of many clients that have added Symbotic robots to its warehouses. This allows companies to deliver more goods at a quicker rate while reducing costs. Symbotic’s resources also take up less space in warehouses which provides more room for inventory.
Symbotic reported 77.6% year-over-year revenue growth in Fiscal Q3 as the figure jumped from $176 million to $312 million.

Aug 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday, the day after a report showed Americans borrowed more than ever on their credit cards in the last quarter, and a day ahead of U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data that could influence Federal Reserve interest rate decisions.
“The markets today are just kind of waffling around. And the reason for that is tomorrow is going to be the CPI report for July being released”, said Jason Krupa, vice president of asset management at Lenox Advisors.
“With price of oil going up, the consumer is the backbone of the economy. If they are too stretched and they stopped spending, that feeds us more into a recession narrative”, said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group in Boston.
Traders put the chance of no rate hike at the Fed's next policy meeting in September at 86.5%, according to CME FedWatch Tool. Rate-sensitive megacap growth and technology stocks that have led the Wall Street rally, such as Nvidia NVDA.O, Apple AAPL.O and Tesla TSLA.O, were down between 0.8% and 4.8%.
The CPI for July, due on Thursday, is expected to show a slight acceleration from last year. On a month-to-month basis, consumer prices are seen increasing 0.2%, the same as in June.
China's consumer sector fell into deflation in July. The consumer price index (CPI) dropped in the world's second-largest economy, the National Bureau of Statistics said, its first decline since February 2021.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 191.13 points, or 0.54%, to 35,123.36, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 31.67 points, or 0.70%, to 4,467.71 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 165.93 points, or 1.2%, to 13,718.40.
The losses followed a broad selloff on Tuesday, after credit rating agency Moody's downgraded several small and mid-sized banks. On Wednesday, big banks extended those losses with Bank of America BAC.N down 0.8% and Wells Fargo WFC.N down 1.3%.
Four of the top 11 S&P 500 sectors rose, with energy stocks .SPNY leading the gain by a 1.22% jump, touching a near six-month high, tracking a jump in crude oil prices.
Casino owner Penn Entertainment's PENN.O shares surged 9.1% on a $2 billion deal with Walt Disney's ESPN DIS.N to launch a sports betting business.
Walt Disney's shares dipped 0.7%, erasing early gains ahead of its quarterly results due after the bell.
Lyft LYFT.O shares tumbled 10% despite a strong earnings forecast, as the company signaled it would double down on competitive pricing to catch up with rival Uber UBER.N.
Of the 443 S&P 500 companies that have reported results as of Tuesday, 78.6% beat analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv data.
“It could be a little bit of that (the market is ) digesting the fact that we're beating expectations (on earnings) but those expectations have been coming down quarter over quarter”, said Krupa.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.06 billion shares, compared with the 10.89 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.63-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 16 new 52-week highs and 7 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 60 new highs and 178 new lows.

Stocks on Friday settled mixed, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 falling to 1-month lows.  Mixed U.S. economic news Friday and an increase in bond yields weighed on the overall market after U.S. July producer prices rose more than expected, bolstering speculation the Fed will keep its monetary policy tighter for longer. However, stocks found support after the University of Michigan’s Aug inflation expectations unexpectedly eased. Also, the strength in crude prices on Friday boosted energy stocks.
U.S. Jul PPI final demand rose +0.8% y/y from +0.2% y/y in Jun, stronger than expectations of +0.7% y/y.  Jul PPI ex-food and energy was unchanged from Jun at +2.4% y/y, stronger than expectations of +2.3% y/y.
The University of Michigan U.S. Aug consumer sentiment fell -0.4 to 71.2, right on expectations.  The University of Michigan's Aug 1-year inflation expectations unexpectedly eased to 3.3%, better than expectations of an increase to 3.5%. Also, the Aug 5-10 year inflation expectations eased to 2.9%, better than expectations of no change at 3.0%.
U.S. stock indexes have a negative carryover from -2% fall in the Shanghai Composite today on concerns about China’s economy after a monthly report on credit growth showed China's July new yuan loans rose by the least amount since 2009.  Chinese stocks also fell on concerns that the country’s property debt crisis is worsening after property developer Country Garden Holdings predicted a multibillion-dollar loss for the first half of 2023. 
Bank of America said investors put money into cash and bonds while pulling money out of the U.S. stock market over the past week.  Data from EPFR Global in the week through August 9 showed cash funds had $20.5 billion of inflows and investors put $6.9 billion into bonds, while stocks had $1.6 billion of outflows.
The markets are discounting the odds at 11% for a +25 bp rate hike at the September 20 FOMC meeting and 36% for that +25 bp rate hike at the November 1 FOMC meeting. 
Global bond yields Friday moved higher.  The 10-year T-note yield rose to a 1-week high of 4.174% and finished up +5.9 bp at 4.165%.  The 10-year German bund yield rose +9.4 bp to 2.623%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield climbed to a 4-week high of 4.536% and finished up +16.2 bp at 4.527%.

Sep T-notes Friday slid to a 1-week low, and the 10-year T-note yield rose to a 1-week high of 4.174%.  Friday’s stronger-than-expected U.S. Jul PPI report was bearish for T-notes. Also, a jump in the 10-year UK gilt yield Friday to a 4-week high of 4.536% weighed on T-note prices.  A supportive factor for T-notes Friday was the unexpected decline in the University of Michigan’s Aug inflation expectations, which eased inflation concerns.

2023-08-14 00:00:00+00:00,Will Revenue Growth Boost Keysight's (KEYS) Q3 Earnings?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-revenue-growth-boost-keysights-keys-q3-earnings,"Keysight Technologies, Inc. KEYS is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 17, after market close. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 9.28%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.58%, on average.

The company is expected to report higher revenues year over year, backed by healthy demand trends for electronic design and test solutions. Its approach of collaborating with leading organizations to accelerate innovation and strategic buyouts is strengthening its portfolio and is likely to have supported the top line during the quarter.
Factors at Play
In the fiscal third quarter, Keysight collaborated with Nokia Bell Labs to test the propagation characteristics of the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) spectrum that is essential for 6G networks. The analysis is likely to have sowed the seeds of innovative software and hardware offerings for the seamless transition to superfast data speed, ultra-low latency and near-infinite bandwidth of 6G networks. Keysight also expanded its autonomous driving validation test solutions with the launch of the E8717A Lidar Target Simulator. These developments are likely to have contributed to top-line growth in the quarter.

During the quarter, Keysight unveiled a new software solution for RF calibration and verification testing procedures. The newly introduced solution in the company’s PathWave Test Executive for Manufacturing Developer Version now effectively automates and simplifies the intricate testing process, primarily catering to the requirements of automotive manufacturers.

It also partnered with Samsung Foundry to revolutionize the workflow automation process. Through the adoption of Keysight's IC-CAP Model Generator, Samsung Foundry aims to accelerate the creation of circuit libraries, a vital component of process design kits for their advanced radio frequency (RF) semiconductor process technologies.

In the quarter-under-review, KEYS inked an agreement to acquire a controlling stake in the French software company, ESI Group. The transaction is valued at $995.81 million. The strategic buyout will significantly augment Keysight’s software prototyping capabilities and enable it to provide software-centric solutions with advanced virtual prototyping and simulation. The portfolio expansion is likely to strengthen its position in the industry.

In the fiscal third quarter, Keysight introduced PathWave Design 2024. This latest suite of EDA software tools aims to address the challenges faced by design organizations in the semiconductor and electronics industry.

The company also unveiled AresONE-M 800GE, a comprehensive multi-speed Ethernet performance test platform, designed to support network engineers with advanced capabilities. The solution offers the most comprehensive DCI (data center interconnects) speeds, ranging from 10 GE to 800GE, within a single test platform that supports all required forward error correction types with in-depth link tuning, stability, reliability and performance measurement statistics. Such initiatives are likely to have boosted the top line during the quarter.

Our estimate for Electronic Industrial Solutions Group segment is pegged at $432.2 million, indicating 6.5% year-over-year growth. Our estimate for Communications Solutions Group segment is pegged at $946.9 million.

For the July quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1,382 million, up from $1,376 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share stands at $2.04, suggesting an increase from the prior-year quarter’s figure of $2.01.
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Keysight in the fiscal third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.

Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.74%. The Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $2.03 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $2.04. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main stock indexes closed lower on Tuesday after stronger-than-expected retail sales data stoked worries interest rates could stay higher for longer, while U.S. big banks dropped on a report that Fitch could downgrade some lenders.
The Commerce Department report showed retail sales grew 0.7% last month against expectations of a 0.4% rise, suggesting the U.S. economy remains strong.
After the data, traders' bets of a pause on hikes by the Federal Reserve next month stayed intact at 89%, yet analysts said investors were worried rates could stay at current levels longer than anticipated.
""We would probably end up with an inverted yield curve for longer than anticipated, even if we don't end up with an economic recession,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.
""That would end up curtailing lending because even if you were my brother-in-law, I wouldn't want to lend to you at a loss.""
A report said ratings agency Fitch could downgrade multiple banks. Shares of JPMorgan Chase JPM.N, Bank of America BAC.N and Wells Fargo WFC.N fell sharply.
""The story from Fitch about potential downgrades to multiple U.S. banks (is) weighing on sentiment,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.
""You combine that with the retail sales figures this morning that were a little hotter than estimates, (it) furthers the potential higher for longer rates scenario from the Fed.""

NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's minutes showed central bank officials were divided over the need for more interest rate hikes at their last meeting.
The minutes of the Fed's July meeting showed most policymakers continue to prioritize the battle against inflation, throwing in uncertainty for the markets over the outlook for rates.
""I agree with the governors that we're not convinced that inflation is totally in the rear view mirror,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
""I think the markets will be on pins and needles regarding what the Fed will do all through September and into October.”
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 33.62 points, or 0.76%, to end at 4,404.24 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC lost 156.59 points, or 1.15%, to 13,474.45. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 179.86 points, or 0.51%, to 34,766.53.
Bank shares extended losses, with the S&P 500 bank index .SPXBK down and Bank of America BAC.N leading losses among bigger banks.
Nvidia NVDA.O also reversed early gains to end lower after rising in the last two sessions, as two more brokerages raised their price targets on the stock ahead of the chip designer's quarterly results next week.
""Investors are starting to take a more sober look at the economic picture here,"" said Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede.

2023-08-17 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Too Late to Buy AMD Stock?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-too-late-to-buy-amd-stock-7,"Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is on a roll. The stock is up by 68% year to date, having nearly doubled from last October's multiyear lows.
The company has become a credible rival to sector giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in processors for desktops, notebooks, and even server systems of late. At the same time, AMD is nipping at the heels of graphics processing unit (GPU) leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) at a time when GPUs hold the key to the booming artificial intelligence (AI) kingdom.
But many investors worry that the time to buy AMD may have passed. If the stock has doubled in a year and trades at a lofty 95 times free cash flows, where is the room for future gains?
Well, let's see if I can find that wiggle room for you.
Bearish thoughts: AMD's recent performance
AMD investors must accept a few unpleasant facts before hitting the ""buy"" button.
The market has priced plenty of AI opportunities into AMD's stock already. The share price rose by 68% from the New Year to August 16, and that's not even the whole story. Measuring from the three-year low point of last October, you're looking at a 97% gain.
Yet the rocket is running out of fuel. AMD's share price is down by 8% in the past month.
At the same time, the business isn't exactly booming. AMD is actually experiencing a significant downturn in terms of financial success. Sales and cash flows are down in recent quarters, and adjusted earnings have turned negative:
AMD Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
So the company isn't profitable and doesn't show skyrocketing sales growth. However, the stock is priced for perfection at 8.1 times trailing sales and 95 times free cash flow. That's way up there in Wall Street's nosebleed seats.
Bullish thoughts: Former glory and future prospects
Of course, AMD's stock didn't fly up to this lofty perch on a mere market whim. People are excited about this investment for several good reasons.
The AI surge is just getting started. Current and future providers of AI-based products and services are merely drawing up their long-term battle plans right now. The hardware investments will come later, unlocking lots of AI orders for AMD and Nvidia.
The global economy has been tucked in bed since November 2021, sipping fiscal chicken soup to get over the inflation flu. At the same time, the semiconductor market suffered a lengthy shortage of manufacturing capacity. As a result, AMD's largest customers tightened their budget belts and scaled back their data center upgrades. Those delayed projects should soon be back on the front burner. Taken together with the expected surge of brand-new AI orders, AMD's resulting growth opportunity could be truly epic for a couple of years.
Once upon a time, AMD was the easily forgotten little challenger to Intel's and Nvidia's dominant market shares. Now, AMD regularly supplies more than 30% of all chips in the general-purpose x86 family. That includes a 25% share in the market for server chips -- an unthinkable idea just a couple of years ago. This little microchip upstart is growing up fast, even during a sectorwide downturn.
The stock chart's rebound from last year's trough sure is impressive, but AMD shares are still trading 33% below the all-time highs of November 2021. You know, just before the inflation crisis started. That was before AMD closed the game-changing Xilinx acquisition, and before OpenAI's ChatGPT kick-started the AI frenzy. If AMD was worth $161 per share back then, assuming further gains with support from those new tailwinds seems reasonable.
Is AMD the stock for you? It depends!
AMD's high-flying stock comes with elevated risks, as any misstep on the road to long-term gains could set off a sharp price correction. That's especially true if the misadventure comes before the pent-up semiconductor demand is released. Unprofitable businesses and stalled growth stories are often quite volatile.
However, the company rarely makes big mistakes under the excellent leadership of CEO Lisa Su. With the AI opportunity and merely delayed data center expansions coming up ahead, AMD looks ready to climb some fresh peaks. And the stock may be pricey on its own terms, but AMD's shares are downright cheap next to Nvidia's 43 times price to sales and 221 times free cash flow.
So AMD's stock sure isn't every investor's cup of chicken soup, but it could be tasty if you don't mind an elevated risk profile. And it is absolutely a lower-priced alternative to Nvidia if you're looking for a hardware-based play in the AI business.

2023-08-22 00:00:00+00:00,Juniper (JNPR) Solution to Boost Digitalization in Vietnam,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/juniper-jnpr-solution-to-boost-digitalization-in-vietnam,"Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR revealed that Viettel Group, a prominent telecommunication entity in Vietnam, has opted to deploy Juniper’s MX960 Universal Routing Platform for high-speed connectivity in the Southeast Asian nation. The agreement signifies an extension of Viettel’s decade-long dependence on Juniper routing and security solutions. Vietnam is one of the fast-growing digital economies in the world and has over 77 million Internet users. Viettel boasts a leadership position with a 54% share of the mobile market and a 40% share of the fiber Internet market.

With a booming e-commerce business and rapid adoption of digital services, there is a growing demand for better network connectivity among consumers. Viettel is aiming to leverage Juniper's MX-SPC3 Services Cards and MX960 Universal Routing Platform to match the rising growth in data traffic. MX960 Universal Routing Platform is packed with highly scalable routing, switching, security and service features. It ensures high performance and greater scalability for service providers in mobile and data center networks. This enables network operators to keep pace with the rapidly changing digital landscape.

Successful deployment of the solution will augment Viettel’s carrier-grade network address translation capacity, which will enable it to efficiently expand its consumer mobile and fixed broadband services, and ensure premium connectivity to end users.

Juniper is leveraging the 400-gig cycle to capture hyperscale switching opportunities inside the data center. The company is set to capitalize on the increasing demand for data center virtualization, cloud computing and mobile traffic packet/optical convergence. It is offering a wide array of products such as the T4000 core router, QFX data center platform, ACX and PTX packet/optical solution, among others.

With the growing usage of smartphones and tablets, mobile data traffic has gone up. This has resulted in higher demand for advanced networking architecture, leading service providers to spend more on routers and switches. It is witnessing strong momentum across core industry verticals and is confident about its long-term prospects. Investments in customer solutions and sales organizations have enabled the company to capitalize on the solid demand across end markets. Juniper is expected to benefit from the higher spending pattern among carriers to upgrade their networks and support the incremental growth in data traffic.

The stock has declined 2.4% in the past year compared with the industry's fall of 20.1%

2023-08-24 00:00:00+00:00,3 Vanguard ETFs That Could Help You Retire a Millionaire,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-vanguard-etfs-that-could-help-you-retire-a-millionaire-8,"Investing is a powerful tool for building wealth. It's probably easier than you think to retire a millionaire -- especially if you get started early.
All you need is a reliable exchange-traded fund (ETF) with low annual expenses, some starting capital, a firm commitment to adding more cash over time, and just enough luck to match the ETF's average returns in the long term. Oh, and a few decades of your time. That's all.
Read on, and I'll show you how long it would take to reach the million-dollar pinnacle with a couple of top-quality ETFs from Vanguard. These index funds come with minimal fees and impressive long-term returns. The slow and steady investing spirit of Vanguard founder John Bogle will serve you well over the years.
Charting your path to $1 million with Vanguard ETFs
I probably don't know you personally, and I most certainly don't know much about your financial situation. With that in mind, here's what I can do for you.

Higher average rewards also come with higher potential risks, and no investment is guaranteed to maintain a steady return forever. The best performers of years past may also turn more volatile in a challenging market and deliver disappointing returns from time to time. Therefore, you should pick a Vanguard ETF that matches your appetite for risk and your targeted results.
The ultra-steady S&P 500 fund can get the job done for people with a long investing timeline. You might get there faster with the tech-focused index trackers, which have shown colossal returns in recent years -- with the caveat that they are more likely to run into occasional slowdowns this way. For example, the Mega Cap ETF and Information Technology ETF have pulverized the S&P 500's results over the last decade. Ranging from 15% to 20% per year, these recent results are so strong that I don't feel comfortable using them as reasonable long-term average targets in my calculations:
MGK Total Return Level data by YCharts
Feel free to adjust the figures I'm using below until they show what you can afford to invest. I'll show you the numbers in two different strategies for three Vanguard ETFs.
The target value will always be $1 million. In one model, you'll start from zero dollars and add $200 per month. In the other, you put $20,000 into the chosen ETF and leave it untouched. Both models will assume that you set up a dividend reinvestment plan, which automatically reinvests dividend payouts into more shares of the same ETF.
And in the end, I'll tell you how long it took to reach $1 million in each case. This way, you'll get an idea how much market risk you must accept in order to reach the million-dollar goal in the time you have left before retirement.
All that being said, let's look at the numbers in chronological order.
Vanguard Information Technology ETF: 12.4% CAGR
The information technology tracker has been around for almost two decades. Vanguard rates it an aggressive fund, warning prospective investors that it exposes your portfolio to unusually large price fluctuations.
It matches the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index. This, in turn, is a market index managed by MSCI, tracking the returns of American information technology stocks. The index is rebalanced quarterly, triggering identical changes to the holding in Vanguard's ETF.
The three largest components, as of the July 31 update, are iPhone maker Apple, software giant Microsoft, and semiconductor designer Nvidia. Together, these three stocks account for 47.4% of this cap-weighted index's value. The ETF currently manages a portfolio of 323 stocks.
On a dividend-adjusted total return basis, this ETF has delivered a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.4% since its inception in 2004. Over the last decade, the CAGR spiked all the way to 19.7%. It is generally not safe to assume that overheated annual returns of that caliber can continue for the foreseeable future, which is why I'll work with the more modest all-time average instead.

Data calculated on Aug. 23, 2023, using an online tool from NerdWallet and average return data from YCharts.
Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF: 11.5% CAGR
The mega cap growth ETF is classified as moderate to aggressive. It's a little bit younger than its information technology cousin, and it tracks a smaller basket of 96 stocks.
This one tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Growth index, which is managed by the Center for Research in Security Prices -- a subsidiary of the University of Chicago. The index manager sorts stocks into different size classes and also classifies each ticker as either a growth stock or a value stock. In this case, the Vanguard ETF follows the CRSP index for mega-cap growth stocks, with the smallest market cap clocking in at $10 billion.
Rebalanced on a quarterly basis, the mega-cap growth index also counted Apple and Microsoft among its largest holdings as of June 30. Online services titan Alphabet snagged the third place, pushing Nvidia further down the list. The trio at the top add up to 37.67% of the total index weight.

Vanguard S&P 500 ETF: 13.4% CAGR
The largest and most robust ETF in my study also clocked the strongest annual returns. It should be noted that it's also the youngest asset of the bunch, even though the index has been around since 1957. It falls under the same risk rating as the mega- cap ETF, classified as moderate to aggressive.
This exchange-traded fund mirrors the returns of its namesake market index, which many investors see as a fair barometer for the stock market as a whole. Managed by S&P Global, the S&P 500 includes 503 stock tickers representing 500 companies. The names are selected each quarter, representing the 500 largest U.S. businesses as measured by market cap and meeting a couple of additional criteria.
As expected, Apple and Microsoft also top the June 30 version of this list. There's another new name in third place, as e-commerce and cloud computing expert Amazon grabs a seat. Nvidia is No. 4 in this case, followed by Alphabet -- all familiar faces, shuffled in a different order. Here, the top three of a 503-ticker ranking list account for just 17.2% of the overall index weight.

LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - World stocks whipsawed on Friday after investors hoping for more dovish remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell instead got a balanced message that the Federal Reserve does not think the inflation fight is over, but it will proceed ""carefully"" in its next move.
In remarks delivered at the central bank conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powell said inflation was still too high even with recent favourable readings, and that the U.S. central bank has substantial ground to cover to regain price stability.
But at the same time, Powell noted that economic uncertainty called for ""agile"" monetary policy making, and that the Fed will proceed ""carefully"" when deciding its next policy move.
""There was a little something for everybody. If you're a bear, you heard him say we're going to be restrictive, and we might hike rates,"" said David Sadkin, president at Bel Air Investment Advisors.
""If you're a bull, you heard him say, we're making progress against inflation and we still expect there to be a lag in from the effects of monetary policy, and we could be on hold.""
Indeed, the balanced remarks led U.S. stocks to gyrate between modest gains and losses. By 1546 GMT, the Dow Jones .DJI lost 0.17%, the S&P 500 .SPX fell 0.30% and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC shed 0.4%. .N
Losses on Wall Street weighed on global shares, and the MSCI All Country stock index .MIWD00000PUS slipped 0.56%.
U.S. rates investors nonetheless dialled back their bets of a rate hike in November and December following Powell's remarks, though Treasury yields traded near break-even by late morning.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR fell 0.4 basis points to 4.231% and the two-year US2YT=RR yield, which reflects interest rate expectations, rose 3.7 basis points to 5.056%. US/
European shares .STOXX also gave up earlier gains to slip 0.14%, and the euro fell to its lowest since mid-June on expectations that the European Central Bank could pause its tightening cycle next month.
ECB policymakers are increasingly concerned about deteriorating growth prospects and momentum for a pause in its rate hikes is building, Reuters reported, citing sources with direct knowledge of the discussion.
Markets are split almost evenly on whether the ECB will hike at its meeting next month, compared with around a 60% chance of a September hike before weak activity data was published earlier this week.
""We've seen a back off in ECB rate hike expectations. The trillion dollar question is how much validation and support that gets from (ECB President Christine) Lagarde today,"" said Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at eToro.
Powell's message on Friday lines up with the mixed signals sent by other Fed officials in the final run-up to the conference.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker told CNBC he doubted the central bank would need to raise rates again, but also indicated he was not ready to predict when rate cuts might begin. Boston Fed President Susan Collins said on Yahoo Finance's video channel that rates may be near or at a peak, ""but certainly additional increments are possible.""
Asian shares also had a lacklustre performance overnight. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares .MIAP00000PUS sagged 1.2%.
The U.S. dollar index =USD - which measures the currency against a basket of six developed-market peers, including the euro - jumped 0.35% to 104.44, a level last seen in early June.
""USD gains have moderated through European trade and the USD has lost minor ground against some high beta currencies as equity markets have strengthened over the session,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank.
Against Japan's currency JPY=EBS, the dollar edged tentatively back toward last week's nine-month high of 146.595.
Tokyo consumer price data on Friday, which front-runs nationwide figures, showed inflation remained well above the Bank of Japan's target. However, the lag in pay increases may be more pivotal for steering policy.
""We do not expect the Bank of Japan to tighten monetary policy because the spike in inflation has not spilled over to a large acceleration in wage growth,"" CBA strategist Joseph Capurso wrote in a client note.
BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda is scheduled to speak at Jackson Hole on Saturday.
In energy markets, crude prices rose on Friday, but remained on track for weekly declines. Brent crude LCOc1 rose $0.82, or 1%, to $84.17 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 was up 73 cents, or 0.9%, at $79.78 a barrel. O/R

LONDON/NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Hedge funds hold record exposure to the seven biggest tech stocks by market capitalization, according to data released on Friday by Goldman Sachs, in a week Nvidia NVDA.Ohit an all-time high after beating revenue expectations.
The largest seven U.S. stocks collectively now make up about 20% of the total net market value held by hedge funds tracked by Goldman Sachs. They have also been instrumental in the gains in the broader U.S. equity market this year.
Microsoft MSFT.O , Apple AAPL.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O, Meta META.O, Amazon AMZN.O, Nvidia and Tesla TSLA.O saw the biggest percent of single stock exposure as of Aug. 24, meaning the positions were trades in the individual stocks, not just in the indices like the Nasdaq.
""Hedge funds continue to embrace mega cap tech and the artificial intelligence theme,"" Goldman Sachs' prime brokerage said in a note sent to a restricted group of clients and obtained by Reuters. The investment bank did not immediately comment on the note.
The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last week, Nvidia reported record quarterly revenue fueled by strong demand for its artificial intelligence (AI)-focused chips and said the AI boom has legs.
""We essentially have had two markets: the 'Magnificent Seven' and all the rest of equities. Hedge funds will be forced into capturing these returns regardless of analysis,"" said Jim Neumann, chief investment officer of Sussex Partners.
""It is momentum on steroids,"" he said, adding that stock-picking hedge funds might find it harder to outperform investments in other asset classes, like fixed income.
Goldman Sachs, which runs one of Wall Street's largest prime brokerages, is able to track trends in flows.
Shares in these companies have all risen over 35% this year, with performances ranging from Apple's 38% rise to Nvidia's 211% jump.
  ""The primary objective of hedge funds is to generate returns, rather than to be imaginative for the sake of diversification,"" said Bruno Schneller, managing director at INVICO Asset Management.
Given the stocks' outperformance, it makes sense to have invested in them, Schneller said.
Daniel Loeb, the CEO of Third Point - which had around $12.6 billion in assets under management at the end of February - said earlier in August that his top five winners in 2023 had included Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet.
HFR's long/short index, which tracks the performance of stock-trading hedge funds that buy and sell stocks, was up about 7% for the year through July, according to the data company's website.

With that being said, there are a few attractive tech stocks set to report earnings on Thursday, August 31. Here are two of these top-rated tech stocks that investors may want to consider.
Broadcom AVGO: Nvidia’s stock is certainly compelling after its strong Q2 results last Wednesday and Broadcom is another semiconductor giant to watch.
Broadcom currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) ahead of its fiscal third-quarter report on Thursday. As a global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices, Broadcom is in the AI conversation with its Jericho3-AI chip which has the ability to wire supercomputers together.
Likely to receive a boost from AI capabilities, Broadcom’s Q3 earnings are expected to rise 7% YoY to $10.42 per share. On the top line, Q3 sales are forecasted to be up 4% to $8.86 billion. With steady annual top and bottom-line growth in the cards as well, Broadcom stock has soared +59% this year to easily top the S&P 500’s +16% and the Nasdaq’s +33%.

Momo MOMO: Also sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Chinese internet and software company Momo is attractive ahead of its Q2 results on Thursday. 
Formerly known as Momo, Hello Group provides a mobile social and entertainment platform primarily used in China. Trading around $9 a share much of the risk to reward still appears to be priced into Momo stock which is up a respectable +7% YTD and has now skyrocketed +98% over the last year.  
To that point, Momo’s earnings are expected to be up 15% from the prior year quarter at $0.38 a share compared to $0.33 per share in Q2 2022. This is despite Q2 sales projected to be down -9% to $423.77 million. Plus, annual EPS estimates have trended higher which supports the case that Momo stock is cheap at just 5.5X forward earnings.

Other Stocks to Watch
Investors will also want to pay attention to Dell Technologies' DELL Q2 report on Thursday with its stock landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Dell is partnered with Nvidia on their joint artificial intelligence venture Project Helix.
With Nvidia crushing its Q2 top and bottom line expectations last week, there is much optimism that Dell could do the same as the technology solutions provider looks to expand services for generative AI.
Zacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock
It's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.
With strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.

2023-08-30 00:00:00+00:00,UAE's G42 launches open source Arabic language AI model,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/uaes-g42-launches-open-source-arabic-language-ai-model-0,"By Max A. Cherney
Aug 30 (Reuters) - A group of engineers, researchers and a Silicon Valley-based chip company collaborated to release advanced Arabic language software that can power generative AI applications.
The new large language model called Jais contains 13 billion parameters that was made from a big batch of data combining Arabic and English, a portion of which is from computer code.
The group, which included academics and engineers embarked, on the project in part because they said there are few large language models that are bilingual.
The new language model was created with the help of supercomputers produced by the Silicon Valley-based Cerebras Systems, which designs dinner plate-sized chips that compete with Nvidia'sNVDA.O powerful AI hardware. Nvidia's chips are in short supply, which has driven companies around the world to seek alternatives.
Named after the highest peak in the United Arab Emirates, Jais is a collaboration between Cerebras, Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence and a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi-based tech conglomerate G42 called Inception, which focuses on AI.
Because there is not enough Arabic data to train a model of Jais' size, the computer code within the English language data helped train the model's ability to reason, according to Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence professor Timothy Baldwin.
""(Code) gives the model a big leg up in terms of reasoning abilities, because it spells out the (logical) steps,"" Baldwin told Reuters.
Jais will be available via an open source license.
The group trained the Jais model on a Cerebras supercomputer called a Condor Galaxy built in partnership with G42. This year Cerebras announced it had agreed to build three such units with G42, with the first scheduled to arrive this year and two additional units to be delivered in 2024.
""This model was trained, from start to finish, of 13 billion (parameters), in three and a half days,"" Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman said. ""But there was months of work before that.""

2023-08-31 00:00:00+00:00,"IBM, Fujifilm Team Up to Develop 50TB Native Tape Storage",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ibm-fujifilm-team-up-to-develop-50tb-native-tape-storage,"International Business Machines Corporation IBM collaborated with Fujifilm to develop a native tape storage system boasting an impressive 50TB capacity. This system stands as the world's highest-capacity native data tape cartridge, about 2.5 times higher than the previous ones.

The sixth generation IBM 3592 JF tape cartridge leveraged a new technology consisting of fine hybrid magnetic particles to significantly increase data storage capacity.

Tape storage is often used in conjunction with other storage technologies like cloud storage, or within a hybrid storage environment. This approach empowers enterprises to harness the advantages of tape storage and other storage methods, per the requirements of different data types and varied use cases.

The newly developed high-density tape cartridge has been designed for IBM's latest enterprise tape drive, the TS1170. The state-of-the-art IBM TS1170 Tape Drive provides enterprises with a remarkable storage capacity of up to 150TB of data on a single tape cartridge with a 3:1 compression ratio.

Organizations worldwide are witnessing substantial expansion of data volumes. This surge has propelled the development of various methods for efficiently managing and safeguarding this vast pool of information.

Enterprises are seeking a cost-effective approach to optimize the use cases of big data, cloud computing and analytics and realize their business goals. The IBM TS110 drive and 3592 JF tape cartridge will ensure storage cost optimization without compromising on performance and time to data.
The advanced technology integrated into the IBM 3592 JF cartridge is well-suited for the long-term retention of extensive data sets, such as scientific and industrial data. Additionally, its robust security features and extended retention capabilities make it a viable choice for cloud service providers.

Fujifilm has leveraged nanoparticle design technology to enhance areal recording density, the amount of data that can be recorded per square inch. The improved thin-layer coating technology ensures a more uniform and smoother tape surface that offers an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. Integration of Fujifilm’s latest innovation significantly augmented the capacity compared to the previous generation cartridges. These advancements are poised to provide IBM with a significant advantage in the storage applications market and enhance its commercial prospects.

IBM is poised to benefit from strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in Software and Consulting. The company’s growth is expected to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing and security in the long haul. The combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investment in growth opportunities will likely drive profitability.

The stock has gained 14.3% over the past year compared with the industry’s rise of 8.2%.

2023-09-01 00:00:00+00:00,Surging Stocks That Can Keep Taking Market Share,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/surging-stocks-that-can-keep-taking-market-share,"Taking market share is crucial for companies and their stocks as a large market cap has numerous advantages.
Large-cap companies can secure cheaper financing and have a consistent stream of revenue while capitalizing on the recognition of their brand. This allows a company to operate on a greater scale which can increase profitability in correlation with economies of scale.
Typically for stocks, large-cap companies are valued at $10 billion or higher and tend to have the greatest trading liquidity. Higher trading liquidity allows large-cap stocks to be traded on the stock market quickly, without having a significant effect on their price.
Furthermore, market cap allows investors to compare the size, growth potential, income, and risk of different companies.
Let’s take a look at a few surging stocks that may be able to keep taking market share and boost investors' portfolios.
Technology Leaders with a Large Market Share
With this year’s surge in tech stocks, there are a number of companies that are retaining or growing their hefty valuations.
It's hard to not have this conversation without mentioning Apple AAPL or Nvidia NVDA with a market cap of roughly $3 trillion and $1.2 trillion respectively.
Apple is the highest-valued company on U.S. stock exchanges with Nvidia the fifth largest and continuing to take market share among chipmakers. Nvidia’s market cap is now 122% above the Zacks Semiconductor-General Markets' $54.82 billion average which alludes to why NVDA shares have kept climbing over the years.

Nvidia currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has soared +223% this year. More astonishing, NVDA shares are now up 12,000% over the last decade and this somewhat unending stellar performance could continue with Nvidia’s chips powering the AI revolution.
As for Apple, its stock has climbed +43% this year and currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Of course, Apple can only fall out of the top spot in terms of market cap but the company’s $48 billion cash pile is indicative of the benefits of taking market share. Furthermore, with a pipeline of famous tech products Apple stock is up +963% in the last 10 years and is usually a viable option for longer-term investors.

A Retail Company Poised to Take Market-Cap
Looking at smaller companies that may be on their way to taking market share or eventually achieving large-cap status is always beneficial. This could correlate with lofty stock market gains and Urban Outfitters URBN stands out in this regard.
With a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Urban Outfitters is a popular fashion retailer that caters its apparel and merchandise to younger generations. Urban Outfitters has shown signs of taking market cap in the past hitting a peak of $6.25 billion back in 2018.
While Urban Outfitters' market cap is currently at $3 billion, we can see from the chart below that this is now on par with its Zacks industry further suggesting the company is a sound investment in the space and may have a chance at being a disrupter (and has already been so).

Plus, Urban Outfitters' steady growth is reason to believe it might be taking real market share along the way. Urban Outfitters' stock has climbed +39% YTD as earnings are forecasted to pop 82% in its current fiscal 2024 to $3.18 a share compared to $1.75 per share a year ago.
More importantly to seeing continued brand growth, sales are expected to be up 6% in FY24 and rise another 4% in FY25 to $5.30 billion. Better still, FY25 sales projections would represent 55% growth over the last five years with FY21 sales at $3.45 billion.

Bottom Line
Taking market share puts companies in a position to offer shareholders unprecedented returns in regard to their stocks. This makes keeping an eye on a stock's market cap beneficial to investors as well. To that point, Apple, Nvidia, and Urban Outfitters are three stocks to watch.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2023-09-05 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks to Avoid This Week,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-avoid-this-week-94,"Wall Street moved nicely higher last week. I thought my three stocks to avoid for that week -- Altria , Affirm , and Tilly's -- were going to lose to the market. They rose 1%, 23%, and 5%, respectively; an average gain of 9.7% for the week.
The S&P 500 moved 2.5% higher. So I was wrong. But I've still been right in 61 of the past 97 weeks, or 63% of the time.
Let's turn our attention to the current week. I see Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Affirm (NASDAQ: AFRM), and American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE: AEO) as stocks you might want to consider steering clear of this week. Let's go over my near-term concerns with all three investments.
1. Nvidia
The bigger they are, the harder they fall. Nvidia has been one of this year's biggest winners. The stock is up 232% so far in 2023, more than tripling despite serving up some relatively ho-hum results. Revenue rose just 10% over the past 12 months, and that follows flat top-line growth in the last fiscal year.
There's naturally a lot more to Nvidia than its trailing growth. Nvidia is the leading player when it comes to graphics processing units (GPUs), but it has also emerged as a market fave for investors hoping to cash in on the artificial intelligence revolution. The future is stronger than the past, and that includes its latest quarter as revenue more than doubled and earnings per share soared more than fivefold.

Analysts see Nvidia's revenue surging 103% this fiscal year with earnings per share more than tripling. Bears argue that Nvidia's valuation is outrageous, but that's the view from the rearview mirror. Nvidia is trading for just 45 times this fiscal year's projected earnings and 29 times next year's multiple.
If this still seems like a bullish pitch for Nvidia, let's go back to the first part. Nvidia is the largest stock to more than triple this year. Its $1.2 billion market cap shadows the second-largest stock to triple with its $80 billion market cap. It has become the top AI investing play, and after back-to-back weeks of healthy gains the market is susceptible to a pullback. The stock's one-year beta of 1.62 translates into Nvidia being more volatile than the overall market. If the market slips in this holiday-abridged trading week, it's fair to say that Nvidia could take a bigger hit than the general market.
2. Affirm
Affirm has done something that you don't see very often. The stock soared 23% two weeks ago. It popped another 23% last week. A better-than-expected financial report helped fuel the stock's initial jump. Some upbeat analyst notes and short covering helped keep the rally going last week.
This is as good a time as any for a breather. It had a strong ""beat and raise"" report two weeks ago, but challenges remain for the ""buy-now, pay-later"" (BNPL) industry. Rates remain stubbornly high, and there are real risks to the Affirm model in the current climate. Analysts don't see Affirm turning an annual profit until at least 2027, so it's not as if time is on its side.
3. American Eagle Outfitters
American Eagle Outfitters hit a fresh 52-week high on Friday. Why? The specialty apparel retailer reports quarterly results on Wednesday, and four weeks ago it offered a rosy financial update. But shoppers aren't necessarily flocking back to American Eagle. The chain's early August update called for flat revenue growth for the fiscal second quarter that it will discuss this week. The good news is that it was initially targeting its top line to decline in the low-single digits.
American Eagle also expects its operating profit to exceed the $25 million to $35 million that it was previously forecasting. This is obviously an encouraging update, but check the chart. American Eagle rose 3% the day it announced that it would go on to top its earlier guidance, a reasonable bounce. It has gone on to pop another 17% in the four subsequent weeks. The stock has discounted a blowout performance. Is flat revenue growth worth this kind of helium? Some retailers are seeing weakness as customers prioritize low-margin essentials as purchases. American Eagle will have a lot to prove this week.
The stock market is always on the move. If you're looking for safe stocks, you aren't likely to find them in Altria, Affirm, and American Eagle Outfitters this week.

Stock indexes this morning are moderately lower, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrials, and Nasdaq 100 indexes falling to one-week lows.  Stocks opened lower this morning on negative carryover from a fall in the Euro Stoxx 50 to a 1-1/2 week low on weaker-than-expected Eurozone economic news. Losses in stocks accelerated as bond yields jumped after today’s Aug ISM services report expanded more than expected, bolstering speculation the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer.
The U.S. Aug ISM services index unexpectedly rose +1.8 to a 6-month high of 54.5, stronger than expectations of a decline to 52.5.
The U.S. Jul trade deficit widened to -$65.0 billion from -$63.7 billion in June, a smaller deficit than expectations of -$68.0 billion.
Boston Fed President Collins said it's ""too early"" to say if inflation is on a sustained path to 2%, and further tightening may be warranted depending on the data.  She added that the Fed will ""need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time"" as while demand is moderating, it continues to outpace supply, adding to price pressures.

Across the markets…
December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ23) today are down -7 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is up +2.6 bp at 4.286%.  Dec T-note prices today gave up an early advance and fell to a 1-1/2 week low, and the 10-year T-note yield rose to a 2-week high of 4.296% on stronger-than-expected U.S. economic news after the Aug ISM services index unexpectedly expanded by the most in 6 months.  Also, comments today from Boston Fed President Collins weighed on T-note prices when she said it is ""too early"" to say if inflation is on a sustained path to 2% and further tightening may be warranted depending on the data.
The dollar index (DXY00) today is up +0.06% and posted a 5-1/2 month high. The dollar recovered from overnight losses and moved higher as T-note yields climbed on the stronger-than-expected Aug ISM services report.  Also, hawkish comments from Boston Fed President Collins supported the dollar. In addition, Chinese economic concerns weighed on the yuan, which fell to a 10-month low against the dollar today. 
EUR/USD (^EURUSD) is down by -0.06% and dropped to a 2-3/4 month low.  The euro gave up overnight gains and turned lower after the dollar rebounded from early losses and moved higher.  Also, weakness in Eurozone economic news weighed on the euro after Eurozone July retail sales fell for the first time in four months and after German Jul factory orders fell by the most in 3-1/4 years.  EUR/USD today initially moved higher on hawkish ECB comments after ECB Governing Council member said the markets are underplaying the risks of an ECB rate hike next week, and Governing Council member Kazimir said a September rate hike is preferable to a later increase. 
Eurozone July retail sales fell -0.2% m/m, right on expectations and the first decline in four months.
German July factory orders fell -11.7% m/m, weaker than expectations of -4.3% m/m and the biggest decline in 3-1/4 years.
ECB Governing Council member Kazimir said the ECB needs to raise interest rates one more time to make sure inflation returns to 2%, and a September rate hike is ""preferable"" to a later increase. 
ECB Governing Council member Knot said investors betting against an ECB rate hike next week are ""maybe"" underestimating the likelihood of it happening.
USD/JPY (^USDJPY) is down -0.10%.  The yen today recovered from a 10-month low against the dollar and is slightly higher.  Comments from Japan’s top currency official, Masato Kanda, sparked short covering in the yen when he said he wouldn’t rule out any options if forex moves continue. The yen gave up some of its gains after T-note yields rose. 
October gold (GCV3) today is down -8.8 (-0.45%), and Dec silver (SIZ23) is down -0.433 (-1.81%).  Precious metals prices this morning are moderately lower, with gold dropping to a 1-week low and silver falling to a 2-week low.  Today's rally in the dollar index to a 5-1/2 month high is bearish for metals.  Also, rising global bond yields are negative for precious metals prices.  In addition, hawkish central bank comments undercut precious metals when Boston Fed President Collins said it is ""too early"" to say if inflation is on a sustained path to 2% and further tightening may be warranted, and ECB Governing Council member Kazimir said the ECB needs to raise interest rates one more time to make sure inflation returns to 2%.

2023-09-07 00:00:00+00:00,Guide to Artificial Intelligence ETFs,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/guide-to-artificial-intelligence-etfs-0,"Robots and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly gaining precedence in our daily life. The pandemic-driven stay-at-home trend made these more important as we have become more dependent on technology. The growing accessibility and falling costs are also making the space more demanding and lucrative.
The global artificial intelligence (AI) market size was valued at $454.12 billion in 2022 and is expected to hit around $2,575.16 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 19% from 2023 to 2032, per Precedence Research. The recent success of ChatGPT also made the space even more intriguing. ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in November 2022.
It is constructed on top of OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language models and has been modified further using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. OpenAI has now been working on a more powerful version of the ChatGPT system called GPT-4, which is set to be released in 2023.
How Hot Is Artificial Intelligence as an Investing Area?
Artificial intelligence can transform the productivity and GDP potential of the global economy, per a PWC article. PWC’s research reveals that 45% of total economic gains by 2030 will come from product enhancements, boosting consumer demand.
This will be possible because AI will bring about product variety, with increased personalization and affordability. The maximum economic benefit from AI will be in China (26% boost to GDP in 2030) and North America (14.5% boost), per PWC.
As AI continues to evolve and reshape our world, Nvidia NVDA stands at the forefront, ready to harness the potential of a $600 billion market. With sustainability in mind and a track record of innovation, Nvidia's vision for accelerated computing promises a brighter future powered by AI-driven technology. Nvidia exec Manuvir Das recently presented some interesting numbers on the market for AI technology, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.
Breakdown of the AI Market
Das noted that the $600 billion total addressable market comprises three major segments:
    Chips and Systems ($300 Billion): The foundation of AI, hardware like GPUs and specialized AI chips will play a crucial role in powering AI applications across various industries.
    Generative AI Software ($150 Billion): Software that generates content, such as ChatGPT, is gaining traction and transforming creative processes, content generation, and data analysis.
    Omniverse Enterprise Software ($150 Billion): Enterprise solutions that leverage AI to enhance productivity, collaboration, and innovation within organizations.
AI Industry Currently in Early Stages
Manuvir Das pointed out that the industry is still in its early stages when it comes to accelerated computing. He drew a parallel between traditional CPU-based computing and the transformative potential of accelerated computing.
As computing becomes increasingly integral to business operations, the demand for data centers, energy, and processing power escalates. This growth pattern, Das argued, is unsustainable without a fundamental shift towards accelerated computing.
Big Techs Foraying Into A.I. With Full Force
No wonder, big tech companies are tapping the space with full vigor. Microsoft (MSFT) is investing billions into OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and launched its new AI-powered Bing search and Edge browser. CEO Satya Nadella told CNBC that AI is the biggest thing to have happened to the company since he took over.
Alphabet GOOGL, which has invested heavily in AI and machine learning over the past few years, rushed to roll out its chatbot competitor BARD. However, BARD failed to see initial success as it gave inaccurate information. Meta Platform META released a new AI tool LLaMA. Baidu BIDU launched ChatGPT-style ‘Ernie Bot’.
Amazon AMZN is also not far behind. In a nutshell, the AI war among tech behemoths is heating up as generative technologies capture investors’ attention. Not only these big techs, there are many small-scale A.I. companies that could be tapped at a go with the ETF approach.
Against this backdrop, below, we highlight a few artificial intelligence ETFs that are great bets now.

2023-09-08 00:00:00+00:00,Synopsys (SNPS) Adds New Extension to Its Synopsys.ai EDA,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/synopsys-snps-adds-new-extension-to-its-synopsys.ai-eda,"Synopsys SNPS recently unveiled Synopsys.da, an extension to its existing Electronic Design Automation (“EDA”) Solution called Synopsis.ai. This new upgrade will allow chipmakers to obtain actionable design insights to uncover power, performance and area (PPA) opportunities in all stages of the integrated circuit (IC) chip development process.

Synopsys' EDA Solution has been used for chip-design optimization. The company has been focusing on enhancing its capabilities by introducing AI-driven tests and verification flows.

With the addition of this new extension, the EDA is expected to gain the capability to analyze extensive streams of data related to fab equipment process control. This analysis will result in enhanced operational efficiencies as well as the optimization of product quality and fab yield.
Synopsys Benefits From a Strong Partner Base
Synopsys benefits from an expanding partner base that includes the likes of Intel INTC, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Juniper Networks, Realtek, Teradici, NetLogic Microsystems, Toshiba and Wolfson.

Intel entered a strategic partnership with Synopsis in August 2023. The collaboration between these two leading chip makers was aimed at leveraging Intel’s extensive network of chip foundry factories while using Synopsys’ IP and EDA technology. This partnership is part of Intel's efforts to regain its position as the leading chip manufacturer by 2025.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2023-09-11 00:00:00+00:00,Will U.S.-China Tech Squabbles Threaten Tech Stocks?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-u.s.-china-tech-squabbles-threaten-tech-stocks,"Several mega-cap technology stocks and suppliers to Apple (AAPL) tumbled last week after the Chinese government banned iPhones from government-backed agencies and state companies, thereby threatening iPhone sales.  Also, suppliers to Huawei Technologies came under pressure last week, with some U.S. lawmakers calling for a halt to all U.S. exports to the company.
Apple lost more than -5% last week on news that the Chinese government plans to expand a ban on using iPhones in sensitive departments to government-backed agencies and state companies. The action by China threatens to erode Apple’s position in China, a market where Apple receives about 20% of its yearly revenue.  However, most analysts believe China is unlikely to completely ban iPhones as the country still benefits greatly from Apple’s presence.
Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM), the world’s biggest supplier of smartphone chips, slumped more than -7% last week on the China news.  A widening ban in China on iPhones undercut the stock since Qualcomm is one of the iPhone's biggest vendors.  Also, news that U.S. lawmakers are scrutinizing suppliers to Huawei Technologies weighed on Qualcomm as it provides Huawei with older generation 4G chips.  However, Qualcomm received a boost today after Apple extended its contract with the company to provide it with modem semiconductor chips for three more years. 
Other global chipmakers are also under pressure due to the ongoing U.S.-China tech squabbles.  SK Hynix, a key supplier to both Apple and Nvidia (NVDA), dropped more than -6% last week on the revelation that some of its products were found inside Huawei Technologies’ Mate 60 Pro smartphone.  Billionfold Asset Management said the slump in SK Hynix reflects “the fear of potential U.S. sanctions” against the company after some of its chips were found in the Huawei smartphone.  SK Hynix gets about a third of its revenue from China.
Despite U.S. policy efforts aimed at ending reliance on the strategic semiconductor industry from foreign companies, the U.S. still gets the bulk of its chips from foreign suppliers. Even after increased import and export curbs, China still accounted for 17% of total chip imports to the U.S. in 2022, down from 25% from 2018, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  The majority of mega-cap chip stocks in the U.S. have registered an average increase of almost 50% in the weight of China among their suppliers over the past four years.  China’s export restrictions are a key risk to the U.S. semiconductor industry, even more than U.S. export curbs because major U.S. chip manufacturers have higher exposure to China on the supply side.

2023-09-13 00:00:00+00:00,Viasat (VSAT) SSD Solution Attains Successful Validation,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/viasat-vsat-ssd-solution-attains-successful-validation,"Viasat, Inc. VSAT recently revealed that its next-generation encryption solution DARC-ssd (solid state drive) 600 has been successfully validated by the U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre. Notably, the DARC-ssd solution is the only hardware-encrypted solid-state drive to obtain this recognition. It is available in three variants, 256GB, 512GB and 1 terabyte (TB).

It leverages Viasat's integrated military-level 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard hardware. This creates complete hardware encryption of both data and the operating system. By mandating strong authentication and encryption within the hardware container itself, this method reduces the likelihood of data manipulation.

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, data breaches are becoming increasingly prevalent. The methods of attacks and data tampering are also becoming more sophisticated. Data breaches can have significant and far-reaching impacts on government agencies and armed forces. This can impact national and financial security and also jeopardize public confidence in the government.

Viasat’s DARC-ssd 600 effectively addresses these concerns. Its Data-at-Rest technology protects sensitive information by securing government devices that may be at risk due to theft, loss, or cyberattacks. The SSD also integrates industry-standard NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) interface and common form factor M.2 2280. This enables customers to upgrade older hardware systems and incorporate the latest tactical military devices with advanced encryption. This ensures high security with enhanced flexibility.

Additionally, the SSD solution also accelerates data loading times while ensuring energy efficiency. These advanced features of DARC ssd 600 are capable of offering high-quality security of commercial and military assets of the U.K. armed forces.

Viasat has a long-trusted business relationship with the U.K. government and its partners. The company has decades of track record as a leading provider of hardware encrypted solutions. The successful testing is likely to solidify the acceptance of Viasat’s cutting edge technology and boost further commercial expansion.

The company is ramping up investments in the development of its revolutionary ViaSat-3 broadband communications platform, which will have nearly ten times the bandwidth capacity of ViaSat-2. ViaSat-3 class of Ka-band satellites are expected to provide enhanced bandwidth with greater flexibility to move and concentrate that capacity virtually anywhere there is demand.

The ViaSat-3 constellation is intended to provide high-speed and high-capacity connectivity to expand coverage and help bridge the digital divide in areas with limited Internet access. Viasat’s blue-chip customer base, which comprises the U.S. Department of Defense, civil agencies, allied foreign governments, satellite network integrators, as well as large communications service providers and enterprises, adds to its strength.

Furthermore, the growing adoption of inflight Wi-Fi services in commercial aircraft is proving conducive to business growth. Viasat’s impressive bandwidth productivity sets it apart from conventional and lower-yield satellite providers that run on incumbent business models. It has a competitive advantage in bandwidth economics, global coverage, flexibility and bandwidth allocation, which makes it believe that mobile broadband will act as a profit churner with a significant improvement in in-flight connectivity revenues.

The stock has lost 39.9% over the past year compared with the industry's fall of 13.6%.

Viasat currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2023-09-14 00:00:00+00:00,Investors Flee Mega-Cap Tech Stocks with China Exposure,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investors-flee-mega-cap-tech-stocks-with-china-exposure,"The resurgence in geopolitical tensions between China and other countries has prompted some investors to shift their asset allocations away from companies exposed to China. The latest challenges include the Chinese government’s position on Apple (AAPL) and the news that the European Union was investigating Chinese subsidies for electric vehicles.
The concerns about China have investors fleeing some mega-cap technology stocks with major exposure to China, such as Apple and Nvidia (NVDA), and moving into other mega-cap technology stocks without China exposure, such as Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META), both of which are blocked from operating in China. Also, Amazon.com (AMZN), which exited China, should benefit.
Fiduciary Trust Company said, “We are significantly underweight stocks with China exposure, driven by concerns over investor protections, the country’s economic competition with the West, and the simple reality that China is not the growth engine it once was.”
Other investment managers are beginning to diversify some of their assets away from mega-cap technology stocks with significant exposure to China.  Winslow Capital Management said China’s move to restrict the use of Apple products in state-owned companies and other government agencies “suggests things could become incrementally more difficult for Apple or other companies with large chunks of China revenue.” Winslow Capital Management, which owns both Apple and Tesla in its portfolio, said it is underweight the pair relative to their size in the Russell 1000 Growth Index.
A recent Bank of America global fund manager survey shows that due to broader concerns about China’s struggling economy, investors have shifted their equity allocations toward the U.S. and away from China, saying the “avoid China” theme has become one of the biggest convictions among its surveyed investors.  According to the survey, emerging markets asset allocation fell to a net 9% overweight in September from 34%, the lowest reading since November 2022.  In contrast, allocation to U.S. equities rose 29 percentage points to a net 7% overweight, the first overweight reading since August of last year.
Other mega-cap technology companies besides Apple, which received 19% of its revenue from China last year, have significant revenue exposure to China.  Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia get more than 20% of their annual revenue from China.  Also, Broadcom’s (AVGO) China revenue exposure is 35%, and Qualcomm’s (QCOM) revenue exceeds 60%.
According to Fiduciary Trust Company, revenues taking a hit, or the potential exposure of having to reconfigure supply chains should tensions mount, could weigh on the stocks of companies with significant China exposure.  “Neither are very encouraging for any company with exposure to China. This issue is hanging over all of them, and it has to be priced accordingly.”

Sept 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks tumbled on Friday as chipmakers dropped on concerns about weak consumer demand, while rising Treasury yields pressured Amazon AMZN.O and other megacap growth companies.
Chip equipment makers Applied Materials AMAT.O, Lam Research LRCX.O and KLA Corp KLAC.O fell more than 4% after Reuters reported TSMC 2330.TW had asked its major vendors to delay deliveries.
Nvidia NVDA.O, Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O, Broadcom AVGO.O and Micron Technology MU.O dropped between 2.4% and 4.3%, pulling the Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX down to a three-week low.

China's industrial output grew more than expected in August, data showed, suggesting that a recent flurry of support measures may be starting to slowly stabilize a stumbling economic recovery.
Data on Thursday showed U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in August, easing worries about a recession.
Treasury yields edged higher ahead of the Federal Reserve policy meeting next week, with the central bank facing a strong U.S. economy with inflation that remains above target.
""We really continue to see that growth resilience story, and I think that's difficult for the market simply because there's concern about what that could mean both for rates and inflation,"" said Lisa Erickson, head of public markets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.
Traders' bets on the Fed holding rates steady in its Sept. 20 policy meeting remained at 97%, while their odds for a pause in November stood at 67%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

The S&P 500 was down 1.19% at 4,451.44 points.
The Nasdaq declined 1.62% to 13,700.53 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.81% at 34,623.61 points.

Neumora Therapeutics NMRA.O, backed by Amgen and Japan's SoftBank, made a tepid debut at $16.50 per share, lower than its IPO price of $17 per share.

2023-09-18 00:00:00+00:00,1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist and 1 That You Should Steer Clear Of,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-artificial-intelligence-ai-growth-stock-to-buy-hand-over-fist-and-1-that-you-should,"On the heels of the worst economic downturn since 2008, things are finally starting to look up. Each of the major market indexes has recovered at least 20% from their recent lows. The only thing standing between Wall Street and the next bull market is the market indexes reaching new all-time highs.
Helping drive the rebound are recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the promise of vast productivity gains, though estimates vary wildly. Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management estimates that AI could represent a $14 trillion opportunity by the end of the decade. More conservative predictions from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs estimate the market opportunity at $6 trillion and $7 trillion, respectively, by 2030.
The potential for soaring profits isn't lost on investors, who have been scrambling to buy stocks best positioned to benefit from the accelerating adoption of AI. Unfortunately, not all AI stocks are created equal, and while buying some will be like minting money, others will be like setting your money on fire.

Nvidia is not as expensive as it looks
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is best known as the pioneer for the graphics processing units (GPUs) that generate realistic images in video games. However, researchers discovered that the sheer number-crunching capacity that made that possible could also be used to move vast amounts of data at lightning speeds through data centers and cloud-computing platforms, making them a natural fit for training and running AI systems.
The company's recent results highlight the unprecedented demand. In its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended July 30), Nvidia generated record revenue of $13.5 billion, an increase of 101% year over year, while earnings per share (EPS) of $2.48 climbed 854%.
Management expects the company's growth spurt to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace. Nvidia is forecasting third-quarter revenue of roughly $16 billion, which would not only mark an all-time high but also represent growth of 317% year over year and 18% sequentially. It's worth noting that the comps are partially skewed by last year's market downturn, but the growth is nonetheless extraordinary.
CFO Colette Kress was clear that the ""Strong demand ... was primarily driven by the development of large language models and generative AI."" Leading the charge were cloud-service providers and large consumer-internet companies scrambling to meet the increasing demand to leverage AI.
Easy comps from last year's downturn notwithstanding, this suggests the AI boom is only just beginning for Nvidia. This has driven its stock price up more than 200% so far this year.
While Nvidia isn't without competition, its processors are the gold standard in the industry. This likely explains the company's market dominance, controlling an estimated 95% share of the machine learning market, according to New Street Research.
Nvidia will continue to benefit as cloud providers and data-center operators fortify their systems with the latest AI-enabled semiconductors to meet this increasing demand.
Data by YCharts.
Some investors will scoff at Nvidia's lofty valuation, but the stock isn't nearly as expensive as it looks. While the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 110 might seem outlandish at first glance, the recent steep decline was the result of Nvidia's blowout earnings, which cut its valuation by more than half.
Given the multitrillion-dollar opportunity and its dominant market share, I'd argue the stock is still worth every penny.
C3.ai: Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain
Given its name and telltale ticker, it isn't surprising that investors might consider C3.ai (NYSE: AI) a potential winner of the AI revolution. After all, the company boasts of having ""over 40 turnkey enterprise AI applications that meet the business-critical needs of global enterprises"" across a variety of industries. C3.ai's stock has gotten caught up in the frenzy for all things AI, with its shares soaring 148% year to date. By outward appearances, it seems pretty cut and dry, but problems lurk just below the surface, showing why this stock is a flaming dumpster fire.
A glance at C3.ai's recent financial results paints an ugly picture. For its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended July 31), C3.ai delivered revenue of $72.4 million, up 11% year over year, resulting in a loss per share of $0.56, just slightly better than the $0.67 loss it delivered this time last year.
Given the mad rush for AI tools, you'd think C3.ai would be a primary beneficiary of those expenditures, but the financial results provide evidence to the contrary. This illustrates that during an unprecedented time for AI adoption, C3.ai has failed to capitalize on the opportunity.
While the company's forecast shows improvement, it still flies in the face of the soaring demand for AI. C3.ai is guiding for revenue growth of 19% year over year in Q2 and just 15% for the full fiscal year while its operating losses continue. Yet, despite its tepid growth, weak outlook, and mounting losses, the stock still sells for 11 times sales.
If that's the best C3.ai can do during a period of unparalleled demand for AI, there are much better places for investors to put their money.

Following pandemic-driven supply chain disruptions, many American companies are seeking to reduce their dependence on China. India boasts a large and highly skilled labor force, and the government is eager to attract more foreign investment.
China’s geopolitical tensions with the US and its Western allies have also encouraged large multinationals to explore alternatives to China.
The world’s most valuable company, AAPL, is reportedly planning to increase its manufacturing presence in India to account for approximately 20% of its global iPhone production over the next two years. Nvidia NVDA recently announced partnerships with Indian conglomerates Tata Group and Reliance Industries in the field of artificial intelligence.
India recently successfully hosted the G-20 summit, showcasing the Indian government's efforts to assume a leading role in global affairs as the West aims to counterbalance China's rising influence.
According to the IMF's World Economic Outlook, India remains the world's fastest-growing major economy, with a projected growth rate of 6.1% for this year and 6.3% in 2024. Goldman Sachs predicts that India is poised to become the world’s second-largest economy by 2075; currently, it holds the position of the world’s fifth-largest economy.
However, the world’s most populous country lags behind China by decades in terms of infrastructure development, although the government has been making efforts to increase investments in this area. Substantial work also remains to be done in deregulation and tax reform to establish itself as a prominent manufacturing hub.

2023-09-21 00:00:00+00:00,3 Chip Stocks to Watch in the ‘Green Zone’,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-chip-stocks-to-watch-in-the-green-zone,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
With the rising adoption of generative artificial intelligence technology, there’s now an AI gold rush, and semiconductor companies are selling the “picks and shovels.” Hence, all eyes are on the top chip stocks to watch, but are these names also in the “Green Zone?”
TradeSmith offers investors valuable tools for determining which stocks to watch. A good example is its Health Indicator feature. This comprehensive indicator provides an overall rating of a stock’s current health.
Using this metric, you can quickly find potential opportunities to explore. Broken down into three “zones” (green, yellow, and red), you’ll have a general idea about whether it’s best to be bullish, bearish, or neutral on a particular stock.
As you may have guessed, stocks in the “Green Zone” are performing well, with little indication that the trend is on the verge of shifting.
A stock in the “Yellow Zone” has corrected by more than 50% of its volatility quotient (or VQ), a proprietary TradeSmith metric that helps measure a stock’s risk. When a stock in your portfolio goes from green to yellow, it may be a good time to reassess whether to maintain the position.
Stocks entering the “Red Zone” have corrected by more than their calculated volatility quotient. VQ can be useful when adding stop losses to positions. View any move into the Red Zone as a warning sign to exit your position for now.
These three chip stocks to watch are currently in the “Green Zone.”
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Shares in chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have been in the “Green Zone” for more than four months. Some may believe that the stock rallied prematurely due to the AI megatrend, given that the company was not exactly a first mover in the area of AI chips.
However, while it has taken some time for a strong AI growth catalyst to develop for AMD stock, one may be just around the corner. Advanced Micro Devices plans to launch its MI300 AI accelerator chip by year’s end. As Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers recently argued, this chip launch means “increasing confidence” when it comes to the company’s operating performance during 2024.
With this in mind, instead of waning, AI mania surrounding Advanced Micro Devices could perhaps get even stronger over the next 12 months. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for AMD is 40.32%, which makes it a high-risk stock.
Intel (INTC)

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has only recently become a “Green Zone” stock, entering just over two weeks ago. Admittedly, this major chip maker has received far less of a boost from rising excitement about generative AI. This makes sense. Other factors, like the uncertainty surrounding Intel’s turnaround efforts, are outweighing this industry tailwind.
Even so, you may not want to underestimate Intel’s potential to capitalize on the surging demand for AI chips. According to Melius Research’s Ben Reitzes, with INTC stock, possible upside from the company’s Gaudi AI chip hasn’t been priced in. That said, it may take some time for investors to finally appreciate this aspect of the overall story with Intel.
However, once near-term worries still weighing on shares clear up, Intel’s AI catalyst could finally take center stage. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for INTC is 28.03%, making it a medium-risk stock.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in the “Green Zone,” having entered it over six months ago. Shares in this leading AI chip company have nearly tripled in price, largely because it’s one of the few companies so far to successfully monetize this technology.
Yet with the stock pulling back in recent weeks, you may be concerned that fading AI mania means more declines ahead for NVDA stock. Then again, maybe not. Although shares may be vulnerable to some more moderate weakness in the near term, this growth catalyst could once again propel NVDA to higher prices.
How? While having an impact now, AI is poised to have an even greater boost for the bottom line over the next few years, according to sell-side forecasts. This growth acceleration means Nvidia will likely stay one of the chip stocks to watch. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for NVDA is 45.51%, making it a high-risk stock.

2023-09-22 00:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin Miner ETF Tops in First Nine Months: 5 Best Stocks,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-miner-etf-tops-in-first-nine-months%3A-5-best-stocks,"Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF WGMI, which provides exposure to the bitcoin mining industry, has gained about 117% so far this year, becoming the top-performing ETF of the first nine months of 2023.

Although most of the stocks in WGMI’s portfolio delivered strong returns in the first nine months, a few have more than doubled. These include Cipher Mining Technologies Inc. CIFR, Bit Digital BTBT, Iris Energy IREN, Applied Digital Corporation APLD and Nvidia NVDA.

Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, had a strong start to 2023, surging 83% to a peak of $31,035 and shrugging off the economic uncertainty and regulatory crackdown woes on some crypto exchanges. However, a significant drop of 7.2% was observed in mid-August, with its value declining from $29,000 to $26,000 within a single day. Bitcoin dipped again in September, reaching as low as $25,000, but it didn't breach its resistance level (read: 5 Favorable Events Bitcoin Had in 2023: ETFs in Focus).

A wave of optimism from institutional investors has led to the surge in cryptocurrency. This optimism was sparked by a few key factors:

High Profile ETF Application: BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, recently applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a Bitcoin ETF, although this application awaits approval. This move likely signaled that large institutional players were showing an increased interest in Bitcoin.

Grayscale Wins Suit Over ETF Application: A court ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission must reconsider asset manager Grayscale’s application to launch the first bitcoin ETF. The ruling could help clear the path for the first ETF offering direct exposure to bitcoin, which would allow anyone with a brokerage account to invest in the cryptocurrency (read: Bitcoin Jumps as GBTC Ruling Paves Way for Spot ETF).

Launch of a New Crypto Exchange: The launch of EDX Markets, a new digital asset exchange backed by major Wall Street players such as Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities, probably contributed to the sentiment that the infrastructure and acceptance of digital assets were improving, thus sparking more interest in Bitcoin.

Changing Sentiment Among Institutional Investors: Previously, institutional investors were quickly pulling cash out of products due to regulatory concerns. However, the sentiment appears to be shifting, which may have led to increased interest and investment in Bitcoin. As such, institutions such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, which were against virtual currencies before, have now started implementing them into their systems. This is a sign of growing acceptance among institutional investors.

Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of WGMI.
WGMI in Focus

It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.

2023-09-25 00:00:00+00:00,USMC: Bigger is Better with This Mega-Cap ETF ,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/usmc%3A-bigger-is-better-with-this-mega-cap-etf,"The Principal U.S. Mega-Cap ETF (NASDAQ:USMC) believes that bigger is better, as it invests in the largest S&P 500 (SPX) companies. Is this a viable strategy and worth a look from investors? Let’s find out.  
What is the USMC ETF's Strategy?
The Principal U.S. Mega-Cap ETF pursues long-term capital appreciation by investing in U.S. companies “with very large (‘mega’) market capitalizations at the time of purchase,” according to Principal Asset Management. It defines companies with mega market caps as those with market caps in the top 50th percentile of the S&P 500. 
Why focus on these large companies? Principal says that investing in mega-cap stocks offers a multitude of advantages. These stocks typically have strong balance sheets, offer ample liquidity, and have well-known brands. Principal also says that these types of stocks typically provide more durability and stability during volatile market environments. 
These points make a lot of sense -- you don’t achieve a market cap worth hundreds of billions of dollars and hit mega-cap status by being a subpar company, so there’s something to be said for this strategy. But how does it play out in the real world in terms of results? Let’s find out below. 
USMC's Long-Term Performance
It turns out that this mega-cap-focused strategy has been a pretty effective one over time. USMC has returned 20.6% year-to-date in 2023 and 27.1% over the past year. Looking further out, as of the end of August, its three-year annualized return of 11.5% is also impressive, and its five-year annualized return of 12.0% is even better. The fund only launched in 2017, so it doesn’t yet have a 10-year return to measure. However, since its inception in October of 2017, USMC has posted an annualized return of 12.2%.
These returns are actually better than those of the broader market, putting USMC into an enviable position as one of the ETFs that can say it has beaten the market over time. For comparison, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO), a good representation of the S&P 500, has returned 14.3% year-to-date and 20.1% over the past year.
Also, as of the end of August, VOO returned 10.5% and 11.11% over the past three and five years, respectively, on an annualized basis, meaning that USMC slightly outperformed it over these timeframes as well. 
Below, you can take a look at a comparison of USMC and VOO using TipRank’s ETF comparison tool, which enables investors to compare up to 20 ETFs at a time across a wide range of criteria, including expense ratios, assets under management (AUM), and performance over a variety of time horizons.
Reasonable Expense Ratio
In addition to producing market-beating results over the past five years, USMC is also a fairly cost-effective ETF, with a reasonable expense ratio of 0.12%. An investor allocating $10,000 into USMC would pay just $12 in fees during their first year of investing. If the fund returns 5% per year and the expense ratio remains at 0.12%, this investor would pay just $45 in fees after three years, $82 in fees after five years, and $189 after 10 years.
Investing in low-cost ETFs like this allows investors to protect their principal investment and reap more of the rewards from their gains over time. 
Additionally, it's worth noting that USMC is a dividend payer, although its current dividend yield of 1.4% isn't really significant enough to attract dividend investors.
Mega-Cap Holdings
USMC is not especially diversified, but it isn't alarmingly concentrated either. The ETF holds 43 positions, and its top 10 holdings combine to make up 40.8% of the fund. Below, you’ll find an overview of USMC’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
You likely won’t be surprised to see Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the world’s two largest companies by market value, at the top of USMC’s list of holdings. USMC gives investors plenty of exposure to the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks with these two, plus Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Other members of the Magnificent Seven, like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) appear further down the list of USMC's holdings. The ETF also adds to this large-cap tech flavor with a position in Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).
Beyond big tech, USMC features top 10 positions in other large-cap blue-chip companies like warehouse giant Costco (NASDAQ:COST), consulting firm Accenture (NYSE:ACN), and payment networks Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA).
One thing that many of these holdings have in common is strong Smart Scores. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. An impressive eight out of USMC’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above, and USMC itself features an Outperform-equivalent Smart Score of 8.
The Smart Score is a fan of USMC, and as you’ll see below, so are Wall Street analysts.
Is USMC Stock a Buy, According to Analysts? 
Turning to Wall Street, USMC earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average USMC stock price target of $51.27 implies 18.3% upside potential.
Looking Ahead
In conclusion, USMC ticks a lot of boxes for investors. It has recorded double-digit annualized returns and beaten the broader market over the past five years. Even better, it charges a fee of just 0.12%, which seems very reasonable in light of its strong performance. Also, the fund features a solid portfolio of strong stocks with great Smart Scores, and it enjoys an Outperform-equivalent Smart Score itself. Wall Street analysts are collectively bullish on USMC as well.
The idea of going big by investing in mega-cap companies may indeed be a simple strategy, but it has proven to be an effective one over the past five years, making USMC a solid choice for investors to consider adding to their portfolios.

2023-09-26 00:00:00+00:00,4 Crypto Stocks in Focus Amid Continued Market Volatility,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-crypto-stocks-in-focus-amid-continued-market-volatility,"The cryptocurrency market has been suffering over the past couple of months after staging a solid rebound this year. The scene deteriorated further last week, with the Federal Reserve keeping its policy interest rates unchanged in the 5.25%-5.5% range in its September FOMC.
While the Fed’s decision should have otherwise come as a major boost for the cryptocurrency market, investors’ sentiments were dampened. Investors’ concerns grew following the post-FOMC statement from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who stated that another quarter percentage point interest rate hike is required this year as inflation remains stubbornly high.
Powell also lowered the forecast for interest rate cuts from four to two in 2024, which is likely to not start before September. This means higher interest rates are going to stay for a longer period than expected earlier.
Also, a 25-basis point hike, which is expected in the Fed’s November FOMC, will take the terminal interest rate of this hiking cycle to 5.6%, much higher than the earlier forecast of 5.1%.
The hawkish stance of the Fed saw treasury yields soar to multi-year highs. The yield on the short-term 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note hit 5.441% on Sep 22, its highest level since 2006. This link is closely linked to the possibility of a near-term economic downturn.
Moreover, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield reached 4.494%, hitting its highest level since 2007.
Higher market interest rate has a negative impact on high-growth sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrency. Last year, the cryptocurrency sector was significantly affected by a stringent interest rate increase approach by the Federal Reserve.
The Fed’s hawkish measure followed by a jump in yields on sovereign bonds saw prices of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB) taking a hit the following day.

Sept 27 (Reuters) - A Meta Platforms META.O executive overseeing the company's efforts to develop its own chips for artificial intelligence work is leaving her position at the end of the month, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
Alexis Black Bjorlin, vice president of infrastructure at Meta and a veteran of chip companies Broadcom AVGO.O and Intel INTC.O, headed a team charged with designing a custom chip to handle a range of AI work, a key part of company's efforts to overhaul its sprawling network of data centers for an era dominated by chatbots and image generators. She is leaving her position at the end of the month but not immediately leaving the company, one of the sources said.
Yee Jiun Song, Meta's vice president of engineering, will take over her role, and the company will continue its efforts to develop its own AI hardware, one of the sources said.
Black Bjorlin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Meta on Tuesday is expected to offer that will be a window into what it calls the ""metaverse."" A key feature of that world will be virtual assistants with distinctive personalities, sources have told Reuters.
To create and power those features and others, Meta is reworking its data centers and building powerful supercomputers with chips from Nvidia NVDA.O.
Reuters reported earlier this year that Meta is also working on its own custom chips that would help it both control costs and better chart its own path independent of commercial chip providers. Some of the company's initial efforts proved slower than using existing chips, leading the company to scrap some of its AI chips. Meta is working on a newer chip that will span all types of AI work.

2023-09-28 00:00:00+00:00,US STOCKS-Wall St climbs after investors digest slew of economic data,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-st-climbs-after-investors-digest-slew-of-economic-data,"By Ankika Biswas and Shashwat Chauhan
Sept 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street's key indexes gained on Thursday as investors assessed the latest batch of economic data and looked towards a key inflation metric and any signs of progress on a U.S. funding bill.
Megacap growth stocks including Meta Platforms META.O, Tesla TSLA.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O and Nvidia NVDA.O reversed their early course to gain between 1.6% and 2.6%, steering a more than 1% jump in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.
At 12:12 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 157.12 points, or 0.47%, at 33,707.39, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 32.36 points, or 0.76%, at 4,306.87, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 142.30 points, or 1.09%, at 13,235.15.
Data showed the U.S. economy maintained a fairly solid pace of growth in the second quarter.
Separate readings showed initial jobless claims rose slightly last week - signaling tight labor market conditions - and a higher-than-expected fall in contracts to buy existing homes in August.
However, a looming U.S. government shutdown and an ongoing strike by auto workers are seen dimming the outlook for the rest of 2023.
With just few days away from a shutdown resolution, investors awaited the Democratic-controlled Senate's procedural vote on a bipartisan short term spending measure.
Also on radar will be comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at 4 p.m. ET, while Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee noted the likelihood of changes to the central bank's 2% inflation target once the current bout of inflation is over.
Traders' bets on the benchmark rate remaining unchanged in November and December stood around 79% and 62%, respectively, according to CME's FedWatch tool. Meanwhile, a 25-basis-point rate cut is being priced in as early as March, growing to over 31% in June and July.
Deepening inflation concerns, U.S. oil futures jumped to a more than one-year high on earlier on Thursday.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are on course for their worst monthly performance of the year as Treasury yields hit multi-year highs on uncertainty around interest rates.
All the three indexes are set for their first quarterly decline in 2023.
""The focus is rates. Monetary policy is going to remain restrictive, but this rate hiking is going to come to an end sooner than later,"" said Dennis Dick, market structure analyst at Triple D Trading.
For the day, communication services .SPLRCL and materials .SPLRCM were the top index gainers, while utilities .SPLRCU remained the major laggard.
Among individual movers, Micron TechnologyMU.O dropped 2.8% after forecasting a bigger-than-expected first-quarter loss.
CarMaxKMX.N lost 10.0% after the used-car retailer posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit.
AccentureACN.N slumped 5.3% after the IT services firm forecast full-year earnings and first-quarter revenue below Wall Street targets.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.49-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.83-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded three new 52-week highs and 32 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 22 new highs and 219 new lows.

2023-09-29 00:00:00+00:00,"Is Nvidia (NVDA) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think ""Yes""",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-nvidia-nvda-a-solid-growth-stock-3-reasons-to-think-yes-0,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.
In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.
However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.
Our proprietary system currently recommends Nvidia (NVDA) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 31.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 219.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -27.1%.
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.
Right now, Nvidia has an S/TA ratio of 0.74, which means that the company gets $0.74 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.72, it can be said that the company is more efficient.
In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Nvidia is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 81.8% this year versus the industry average of -6%.
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
The current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2.4% over the past month.
Bottom Line
Nvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
This combination indicates that Nvidia is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2023-10-05 00:00:00+00:00,Keysight (KEYS) Solution Boosts Satellite Communication Testing,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/keysight-keys-solution-boosts-satellite-communication-testing,"Keysight Technologies, Inc. KEYS recently unveiled a cutting-edge Phased Array Antenna Control and Calibration solution designed for efficient testing of satellite communication systems. The technology is the latest addition to the Keysight S7601A antenna measurement toolset. It offers a comprehensive solution that facilitates testing for a wide range of antennas used in diverse applications such as cellular, automotive and satellite communications. Keysight’s new solution encompasses some unique features that minimize testing durations and empower engineers to overcome manufacturing complexities with ease.

The industry is witnessing a growing proliferation of phased arrays in both commercial and military satcom systems. The previously used parabolic dish has a fixed directional beam and various mechanical complexities. The modern phased array antennas can electronically adjust their beams, enabling precise and seamless positioning. However, efficient testing of this complex system is a challenging endeavor. Engineers need an automated testing facility to streamline the intricate and time-consuming validation procedure of such complex systems.  

Keysight’s flexible measurement solution incorporates a proprietary calibration algorithm feature. This allows precise gain and phase measurements, even in a far-field test setup for individual phased array components. The over-the-air calibration and characterization solution integrates all functions into an intuitive software interface. This enables engineers to seamlessly control the high-performance test instruments, the compact positioning equipment and the temperature control unit for the antenna under test.

It supports a wide range of testing procedures, including gain and phase calibration, beam scan analysis, cross-polarization isolation and more. The cutting-edge solution optimizes frequency, gain and phase response to augment signal-pointing accuracy.
 
The advanced features of the new Phased Array Antenna Control and Calibration solution will likely accelerate the development of next-generation satellite communication systems. This latest innovation will broaden Keysight's robust portfolio and reinforce its position as a leading provider of electronic design and test systems.

The company is gaining traction with strong industry-wide growth. It is witnessing solid adoption of its electronic design and test solutions. Electronic devices form the fulcrum of IoT services, wireless devices, data centers and 5G technologies. The rapid adoption of these devices is increasing demand for electronics testing equipment.

Keysight boasts a robust 5G portfolio. Its 5G product design validation solutions, ranging from Layer 1 to 7, enable telecom and semiconductor companies to accelerate their 5G initiatives. Apart from strength in the 5G domain, the company is expected to benefit from the growing proliferation of electronic content in vehicles, momentum in space and satellite applications, and rising adoption of driver-assistance systems globally.

Shares of the company have declined 22.4% over the past year compared with the industry’s fall of 13.8%.

Oct 6 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes reversed course and rose on Friday following a boost from megacap stocks, with investors assessing a fresh jobs report that also pointed to slowing wage growth.
The 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR came off its fresh 16-year high hit after the data. Major growth stocks Microsoft MSFT.O, Meta Platforms META.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O and Nvidia NVDA.O rose about 2%.
The S&P 500 .SPX is now set for its first weekly gain in five, while the Dow .DJI is still on track to decline for the third straight week.
Earlier in the day, data showed U.S. employment increased by the most in eight months in September as hiring rose broadly, pointing to persistent labor market strength, though wage growth is slowing.
""A steady slowing of wage growth momentum should also be a solace for Fed officials given that even with still above-trend job growth, wages are not seeing upward pressure,"" strategists at TD Securities said.
Financial markets and most economists believe the Fed is probably done hiking interest rates because of a recent surge in long-term U.S. Treasury yields.
Traders put the chance of interest rates remaining unchanged in November and December at around 73% and 58%, respectively, according to CME's FedWatch tool.
Information technology shares .SPLRCT were the top gainer among the major S&P 500 sectors, while consumer staples stocks .SPLRCS were the worst hit.
For the week, energy stocks .SPNY are set to be the worst hit among major S&P 500 sectors, while communications services .SPLRCL and information technology are on track to be the top performers.
Looking ahead, data would take center stage once again with September consumer price inflation and producer price index readings due next week.
""It's really going to depend now on next week's data because the Fed would be happy if inflation comes in modest and we still have the job growth,"" said Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor and market strategist for Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management.
Focus will also be on the upcoming quarterly earnings season, with major banks including JPMorgan Chase JPM.N, Wells Fargo WFC.N, Citigroup C.N and asset manager BlackRock BLK.N reporting next week.
At 12:11 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 288.08 points, or 0.87%, at 33,407.65, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 40.33 points, or 0.95%, at 4,298.52, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 161.95 points, or 1.23%, at 13,381.78.
EV maker Tesla TSLA.O fell 1% after cutting prices of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the United States.
Exxon Mobil XOM.N lost 1.7% after sources told Reuters that the U.S. oil producer was in advanced talks to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources PXD.N. Pioneer's stock jumped 10.8%.
Eli Lilly LLY.N rose 3.1% after BofA Global Research hiked its price target on the drugmaker's stock to $700.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 2.23-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.95-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded four new 52-week highs and 51 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 18 new highs and 226 new lows.

Oct 11 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes advanced on Wednesday as long-term U.S. Treasury yields continued to retreat, while investors shrugged off hotter-than-expected inflation data and awaited minutes from the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting.
U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in September amid higher costs for energy products, but underlying inflation pressures at the factory gate continued to moderate.
""The market is responding as if this were essentially a non-event, something that had been anticipated and not something that would cause the Fed to change their inflationary direction,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.
Focus now turns to minutes from the Fed's September meeting at 2 p.m. ET and Thursday's consumer inflation data for clues on the interest rate outlook.
Yields on government bonds have eased from their multi-year highs on dovish remarks from Fed officials earlier this week.
However, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman on Wednesday repeated her view that despite ""some progress"" on inflation, the central bank will probably need to tighten monetary policy further to restore price stability.
Other central bank officials such as Fed Governor Christopher Waller, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Boston Fed President Susan Collins are also scheduled to speak on Wednesday.
Megacap stocks Microsoft MSFT.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O, Tesla TSLA.O, Nvidia NVDA.O and Meta Platforms META.O advanced around 1% each.
Real-estate .SPLRCR and communication services .SPLRCL were the top S&P 500 sector gainers.
Energy stocks .SPNY were the worst hit, hurt by a 3.5% decline in Exxon Mobil XOM.N as the oil and gas producer is set to buy shale producer Pioneer Natural Resources PXD.N in an all-stock deal valued at $59.5 billion. Pioneer was up 0.9%.
Meanwhile, the conflict in Middle East raged on as Israel bombed Gaza overnight ahead of a potential ground assault against Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.
Israel's death toll reached 1,200 with more than 2,700 wounded, its military said, while retaliatory strikes on the blockaded enclave have killed 1,055 people and wounded 5,184, according to Palestinian officials.
The debut of German luxury sandal maker Birkenstock HoldingBIRK.N on the New York Stock Exchange will also be keenly watched. The company has priced its IPO at the middle of its indicated price range at $46 per share.

2023-10-12 00:00:00+00:00,3 Crypto Stocks to Buy as Bitcoin Attempts Another Rebound,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-crypto-stocks-to-buy-as-bitcoin-attempts-another-rebound,"The cryptocurrency market staged a solid rebound this year after a disappointing 2022 as the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening campaign, which saw aggressive interest rate hikes to combat multi-decade high inflation, weighed on cryptocurrencies.
However, cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB), have been rangebound over the past three months as investors are yet to get a clear picture about the Fed’s future course of action with its interest rate hikes.
Bitcoin particularly had been on a rally till July, with its price hitting $31,500. However, the Fed has since hiked interest rates once in July, following which cryptocurrencies took a hit once again. In fact, Bitcoin has been falling since hitting its 52-week high in early July.
However, it has also solidified its position over the past few weeks and is now hovering around $26,900 after falling as much as $25,400 in late August and September.
The rebound has been taking place since the Fed kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged in its September FOMC meeting to its current range of 5.25-5.25%.
A higher market interest rate has a negative impact on high-growth sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrencies. The Fed’s aggressive monetary tightening policy has also raised worries that the economy might slip into a recession.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in his first post-FOMC comment, said that inflation remains elevated, which might require the central bank to hike interest rates by another 25 basis points before it starts cutting interest rates in 2024.
Following Powell’s hawkish comments, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note surged to its highest level since 2007. The 10-year Treasury yield holds immense significance as it mirrors market participants' outlook on the nation's economic situation, influencing consumers, businesses and government entities.
However, cryptocurrencies are once again trying to rebound from their recent lows as investors’ sentiments have been upbeat following dovish comments from a number of Fed officials. These officials believe that the recent tightening of credit conditions may make the central bank decide not to go for another interest rate hike in its November FOMC meeting.

2023-10-13 00:00:00+00:00,Better Growth Stock: Nvidia vs. Super Micro Computer,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-growth-stock%3A-nvidia-vs.-super-micro-computer,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) have been top performers on the stock market in 2023, delivering outstanding gains of 210% and 253%, respectively, as of this writing.
These growth stocks have taken off this year thanks to one common catalyst -- artificial intelligence (AI). While Nvidia has turned out to be a pioneer in AI chips thanks to its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are being deployed in servers to train large language models (LLMs), Super Micro is also providing critical infrastructure as it builds the servers in which the computing and storage chips are housed.
The proliferation of AI has supercharged the growth of both companies, but which one of these two hot growth stocks should you consider buying following their eye-popping jumps this year? Let's find out.
How fast are these companies growing?
Both Nvidia and Super Micro have been delivering robust growth in revenue and earnings thanks to AI.
While Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (for the three months ended July 30) jumped an impressive 101% from the year-ago period to $13.5 billion, Super Micro's revenue increased 33% year over year to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 (for the three months ended June 30).
Nvidia's guidance for the current quarter points toward an acceleration in its revenue growth. Analysts are forecasting the company's revenue to jump to almost $55 billion in the current fiscal year from $27 billion in the previous one. On the other hand, Super Micro's revenue guidance of $10 billion for fiscal 2024 points toward a 40% increase over last year. However, the company could do better thanks to a record-high backlog that it could take advantage of if the supply chain challenges hampering the component availability of AI server platforms improve.
Nvidia, therefore, is growing at a much faster pace than Super Micro, though it was struggling earlier before AI arrived as a catalyst. Meanwhile, Super Micro was doing well even before the AI boom kicked in.
NVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
The chart above tells us that Nvidia's growth has switched into a higher gear only in recent months. The company was struggling before that thanks to a glut of graphics cards in the personal computer (PC) market.
Super Micro, on the other hand, has a more consistent growth curve. That's not surprising as the company operates in the server market that has been enjoying healthy growth since 2020 thanks to infrastructure upgrades by enterprises as well as the need for more storage and computing power to support the increasing amount of data that's flowing into data centers.
The good part is that Super Micro is expected to keep growing at a nice pace in the future, but will it be enough to help it outperform Nvidia on the stock market?
Super Micro and Nvidia are set for solid long-term growth
Super Micro has made its mark in the global server market thanks to its modular solutions that are reportedly helping it win more market share. Barclays analyst George Wang estimates that the company has a 7% share of the server market, but it can keep taking share away from bigger players such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell Technologies.
One of the reasons why that may be the case is because of Super Micro's capacity expansion. Management claims that Super Micro's existing facilities in the U.S. and Taiwan can support at least $15 billion in revenue, which would be a 50% increase over this year's estimated revenue. According to Wang, Super Micro's new facility in Malaysia, which is expected to become operational in the second half of fiscal 2024, could support up to $30 billion in annual revenue.
This facility is coming online at a good time as the demand for AI servers is booming. Foxconn estimates that the size of the AI server market could increase to $150 billion in 2027, which would be a 5x increase over this year's estimated revenue of $30 billion. Assuming all of Super Micro's production capacity is booked, investors are looking at a tremendous jump in the company's top line over the next few years as compared to its fiscal 2023 revenue of $7.1 billion.
Nvidia, on the other hand, isn't expected to be a slouch either as the company is expected to control a whopping 90% of the market for AI chips, according to Citi. With the AI chip market expected to clock 29% annual growth through the end of the decade, Nvidia is sitting on a lucrative secular growth opportunity. This explains why Nvidia's top line is expected to jump 3.5x in the space of just three years to $96 billion in fiscal 2026 from $27 billion in fiscal 2023.
NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts
The verdict
The discussion above tells us that Super Micro and Nvidia are set to sustain impressive levels of growth in the long run, indicating that both of them could turn out to be solid growth picks. However, there is a major difference in the valuation of these two stocks.
Super Micro's price-to-sales ratio of 2.3 makes it way cheaper than Nvidia, which is trading at 35 times sales. What's more, Super Micro is trading at 25 times trailing earnings and 7 times forward earnings. Nvidia, meanwhile, has a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 109 and a forward earnings multiple of 55.
Of course, Nvidia's much faster growth justifies its premium valuation compared to Super Micro. However, investors looking for a growth stock at a cheaper valuation may prefer buying Super Micro given how fast its business is growing and its bright prospects that point toward healthy long-term growth.

NVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+285.4% vs. +152.9%), a huge outperformance relative the S&P 500 index's +18.1% gain. The Zacks analyst believes that strong growth from artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. Large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures, rising demand for generative AI and surge in Hyperscale demand also aid its growth.

Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings have driven the top-line growth.
However, the company’s near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by weakening demand for chips used in the professional visualization end market.

Procter & Gamble shares have outperformed the Zacks Consumer Staples – Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+13.6% vs. +10.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company is benefitting from a growth in its organic sales, driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. Focus on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins have also helped.
Rapid adoption of cloud-based solutions, continued deal wins in international markets, and acquisition of Slack have positioned the company as a market leader.

Yet, supply-chain issues, higher SG&A costs, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation have plagued the company. It’s large global presence has also meant that it has been affected by the global macroeconomic goings on.

Shares of NextEra Energy have underperformed the Zacks Utility – Electric Power industry over the past year (-26% vs. -8.2%). Per the Zacks analyst, the company’s nature of business has exposed it to complex regulations. Also, risks in operating nuclear units, unfavorable weather conditions and increasing supply costs adversely impact earnings.

However, with numerous projects in its backlog and the merger between Gulf Power and FPL have strengthened NextEra’s position in the area. Also, the company has ample liquidity to pay off its debt obligations while growing exponentially through acquisitions.

NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were slightly lower in afternoon trading on Tuesday as Treasury yields rose and shares of chipmakers fell after the Biden administration said it planned to halt shipments of advanced artificial intelligence chips to China.
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX was down 1.1% and shares of Nvidia NVDA.O were down 4.7% even though the world's most valuable chipmaker said it does not expect a near-term meaningful impact on financial results from the curbs.
U.S. Treasury yields US10YT=RRrose on robust economic data. Higher yields dull the allure of stocks by offering investors comparatively high income on risk-free government bonds.
Helping to limit the declines, though, were upbeat earnings reports from companies including Bank of AmericaBAC.N, whose stock was up 2.3% following its quarterly results.
Investors also are still anxiously watching news on the Middle East. U.S. President Joe Biden is set to visit Israel on Wednesday, after Washington said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had agreed to allow humanitarian aid to reach Gazans.
Data earlier showed U.S. retail sales rose 0.7% in September, compared with estimates of a 0.3% rise, while a separate reading showed production at U.S. factories increased more than expected in September.
In other earnings news, Goldman Sachs's GS.N third-quarter profit dropped less than expected. But its shares were down 2.1%.
The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 41 new highs and 124 new lows.

Chicago, IL – October 19, 2023 – Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""We are off to a positive start to the Q3 earnings season, with most companies not only beating estimates but also providing reassuring guidance for the coming periods.""
Q3 Earnings Season Kicks Off Positively
Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>
Here are the key points:
We are off to a positive start to the Q3 earnings season, with most companies not only beating estimates but also providing reassuring guidance for the coming periods.
For the 53 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q3 results, total earnings are up +6% from the same period last year on +6.6% higher revenues, with 84.9% beating EPS estimates and 67.9% beating revenue estimates.
At this stage in the reporting cycle, the EPS beats percentage of 84.9% is tracking above other recent periods and the 20-quarter average of 79.7% for this group of companies.
Looking at Q3 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be down -1.1% from the same period last year on +0.8% higher revenues, the 4th back-to-back quarter of declining earnings for the index.
We are off to a good start in the Q3 earnings season, though the focus at this early stage has been largely on the Finance sector. Most of the big banks came out with better-than-expected Q3 results and described ongoing business trends in relatively reassuring and favorable terms.
This has to count as a big positive for the group, given the all-around negative views on the sector.
Beyond the Finance sector, looking at Q3 expectations as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be down -1.1% from the same period last year on +0.8% higher revenues.
One key sector whose earnings outlook has been steadily improving lately is the Technology sector, whose members will be coming out with Q3 results in the next few days. The sector has been operating in a constrained growth environment since 2021 Q4, but this is on track to change starting with the group’s Q3 results.
A significant source of growth for the group is the 7 mega-cap stocks, most of which are from the Tech sector. We call this group the ‘Big 7 Tech Players’, which includes Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Nvidia NVDA, Tesla TSLA and others.
Q3 earnings for this group of companies are expected to grow by +34.9% from the same period last year on +11.2% higher revenues.
The ‘Big 7 Tech Players’ are a big contributor to overall index earnings now and going forward. Excluding the earnings contribution from the ‘Big 7’, S&P 500 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -6.4% (down -1.1% otherwise).
Given the emerging consensus on the ‘soft-landing’ outlook for the economy, one can expect this favorable turn in the overall earnings picture to strengthen further as companies report Q3 results and share trends in underlying business.
Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?
Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year. Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s credited with a “watershed medical breakthrough” and is developing a bustling pipeline of other projects that could make a world of difference for patients suffering from diseases involving the liver, lungs, and blood. This is a timely investment that you can catch while it emerges from its bear market lows.
It could rival or surpass other recent Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2023-10-23 00:00:00+00:00,"Big Q3 Earnings Headed Our Way: MSFT, GOOGL & More",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/big-q3-earnings-headed-our-way%3A-msft-googl-more,"Markets closed down back where they traded earlier in the pre-market session — with the exception of the Nasdaq, which closed higher for the day. The self-policing of high-bond-yield wariness is keeping equities from jumping ahead, even amidst a better-than-expected Q3 earnings season thus far adding some positive sentiment — or at least dimming fears of a near-term recession. The Dow slipped -190 points today, -0.58%, while the Nasdaq gained +34 points, +0.27%. The S&P 500 split the difference, -0.17%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 lost -0.69%.

The key phrase there is “Q3 earnings season thus far”… Some of the biggest companies on the planet, including a few members of the formerly-known-as FAANG — Meta Platforms META, Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL — as well as Microsoft MSFT, Intel INTC and many more are issuing quarterly reports this week. The basic hugeness of these firms, many of which also constitute the “Magnificent 7” stocks that rose to year-to-date highs on prospective strength in the A.I. space, mean they can change the trajectory of earnings season all by themselves.

Speaking of Intel, shares there took a -3% hit today when it was reported NVIDIA NVDA — #1 of the Magnificent 7 — is planning to produce its own ARM-based chips, which analysts consider a direct challenge to Intel’s market share. NVIDIA was up +4% on the news, and ARM Holdings ARM gained +6%. It’s these sorts of narratives giving the Nasdaq index the upper-hand on trading days like today.

Bond yields always seem to claim a paragraph or so in this column these days, and I suppose this afternoon is no exception: the 10-year bond yield, which had breached +5% momentarily prior to the opening bell on the stock market, pulled back a somewhat noteworthy 15 basis points (bps). The 2-year, which looked willing to give up the inversion of the yield curve earlier, only came down to +5.06% — a scant 5 bps or so. For certain, bond yields are doing some of the Fed’s work for them, curbing any excessive appetite in the equities market.

Aside from Microsoft and Google reporting earnings tomorrow after the close, we also expect to hear from GM GM, GE GE, Coke KO, Visa V and Texas Instruments TXN. You can tell a lot about the economic health of the U.S. just by tracking those companies alone. Continued positive results would keep some upward pressure on stocks, but it’s unclear how much. In normal times, with bond yields so low as to be easily dismissed, strong earnings numbers would send markets on an end-of-the-year surge.

December E-Mini S&P 500 futures (ESZ23) are up +0.50%, and the Dec Nasdaq 100 E-Mini futures (NQZ23) are up +0.54%.
Stock index futures this morning are moderately higher as a decline in T-note yields sparks some short covering in stocks.  Also, some positive corporate news supports the overall equity market, with GE up more than +5% in pre-market trading and Verizon Communications up more than +3% after reporting better-than-expected Q3 EPS.  The markets are awaiting earnings results after the close today from mega-cap technology stocks Alphabet and Microsoft. 
In the Middle East, French President Macron called for an international coalition to fight Hamas and warned other Iranian-backed militant groups not to open new fronts in the Israeli-Hamas war as he met with Prime Minister Netanyahu today in Israel.  Western countries have intensified efforts to stop the Israeli-Has war from spreading, with EU leaders endorsing a United Nations call for a “humanitarian pause” in the war. 
Israel said it supports diplomatic efforts to get Hamas to release hostages from Gaza, a move that could delay a possible ground invasion, although Israel said it won’t wait long to start its ground assault.  Iran and its proxy forces in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen have warned they could retaliate against Israel if Israeli troops enter Gaza. 
Bitcoin surged more than +10% today to a 17-1/2 month high on speculation the SEC will soon approve spot Bitcoin ETFs.  On Monday, a U.S. federal appeals court also formalized a victory for Grayscale Investments LLC in its bid to create a spot Bitcoin ETF over objections from the SEC.
The markets are discounting a 2% chance that the FOMC will raise the funds rate by +25 bp at the next FOMC meeting that ends on November 1, and a 26% chance for that +25 bp rate hike at the following meeting that ends on December 13.  The markets are then expecting the FOMC to begin cutting rates in the second half of 2024 in response to an expected slowdown in the U.S. economy.
U.S. and European bond yields are lower.  The 10-year T-note yield is down -0.4 bp at 4.846%.  The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1-week low of 2.786% and is down -5.0 bp at 2.824%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield fell to a 1-week low of 4.491% and is down -4.8 bp at 4.551%.  
Overseas stock markets are higher.  The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.33%.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed up +0.78%.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 today closed up +0.20%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 today is moderately higher as a decline in European government bond yields improves market sentiment.  The 10-year German bund yields and 10-year UK gilt yields fell to 1-week lows today. Economic concerns limited gains in equities after today’s economic news showed manufacturing activity in the Eurozone fell this month and service sector activity unexpectedly contracted by the most in nearly three years.  Bank stocks are also under pressure today, led by a -6% fall in Barclays Plc after it missed earnings estimates and lowered guidance for the second consecutive quarter.
The Eurozone Oct S&P manufacturing PMI unexpectedly fell -0.4 to 43.0, weaker than expectations of an increase to 43.7.  Also, the Oct S&P composite PMI unexpectedly fell -0.7 to 46.5, weaker than expectations of an increase to 47.4 and the steepest pace of contraction in almost three years.
German Nov GfK consumer confidence fell -1.4 to a 7-month low of -28.1, weaker than expectations of -27.0.
Bloomberg reported that ECB President Lagarde told the presidents of the European Commission, the European Council, and the Eurogroup that the Eurozone economy faces stagnation for the next few quarters and downside dangers, though risks to prices have become more balanced. 
China’s Shanghai Composite Stock Index today closed moderately higher.  Short covering emerged in Chinese stocks after China’s sovereign wealth fund bought exchange-traded funds on Monday, expanding its purchases beyond bank stocks.  In a statement released Monday after markets closed, the Central Huijin Investment Ltd, a unit of the $1.4 trillion wealth fund China Investment Co, bought an undisclosed amount of ETFs and vowed to keep increasing its holdings. The China Fund newspaper reported today that the sovereign wealth fund may have purchased 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in ETFs, with most of the purchases focused on ETFs tracking technology-stock indexes. 
Japan’s Nikkei Stock Index today recovered from a 2-1/2 week low and closed slightly higher.  A decline in Japanese government bond yields today sparked short covering in stocks.  Japanese bond yields fell after the Japan Post Insurance Co. said it plans to shift more of its holdings into yen bonds and reduce its holding of foreign debt securities due to elevated currency-hedging costs and expectations for a stronger yen in the fiscal second half.  Japanese stocks today initially moved lower on economic concerns after news showed manufacturing activity stagnated this month and service sector activity expanded by the slowest pace in 10 months.
The Japan Oct Jibun Bank manufacturing PMI was unchanged at 48.5.  The Oct Jibun Bank services PMI fell -2.7 to 51.1, the slowest pace of expansion in 10 months.

2023-10-25 00:00:00+00:00,"T-Mobile (TMUS) Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates, Guidance Raised",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/t-mobile-tmus-q3-earnings-beat-estimates-guidance-raised,"T-Mobile US, Inc. TMUS reported mixed third-quarter 2023 results, with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The Bellevue, WA-based wireless service providers reported a top-line contraction year over year, owing to declining revenues from equipment sales and prepaid services. However, the company witnessed an industry-leading postpaid customer growth with a record low postpaid phone churn rate. TMUS also achieved its full-year target of covering 300 million Americans with ultra capacity 5G network two months before its targeted deadline.
Net Income
Net income in the third quarter stood at $2,142 million or $1.82 per share, up from $508 million or 40 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year growth despite lower revenues was primarily driven by lower operating expenses. The bottom line surpassed the Zack Consensus Estimate of $1.75.
T-Mobile US, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
T-Mobile US, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | T-Mobile US, Inc. Quote
Revenues
Net sales during the quarter were $19,252 million, down from $19,477 million in the year-ago quarter. Declining equipment revenues impeded the top line during the quarter. The top line missed Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19,347 million.
Segment Results
Total Service revenues were $15,914 million, up from $15,361 million in the year-ago quarter. Net sales surpassed our revenue estimate of $15,458.5 million. The 4% year-over-year growth was primarily driven by improvement in postpaid revenues. Net sales from Postpaid Services contributed $12,288 million in revenues, up 6% year over year.

During the quarter, T-Mobile added 1.2 million postpaid net customers, while postpaid net account additions were a staggering 386,000, both metrics being the best in the industry. Postpaid phone net customer additions were 850,000, with a record low churn rate of 0.87%. High-speed Internet net customer additions were 557,000. Postpaid average revenues per account rose to $139.83 from $137.49 in the year-ago quarter.

Net sales from Prepaid services were $2,473 million, marginally down from $2,484 million in the prior-year quarter. Prepaid net customer additions declined year over year, owing to moderation of industry growth and fewer high-speed Internet net additions year over year. Prepaid churn rate decreased to 2.81% from 2.88% in the year-ago quarter. Wholesale and other service revenues decreased to $1,153 million from $1,329 million in the year-earlier quarter. Prepaid ARPU declined to $38.18 from $38.86 in the year-ago quarter.

Equipment revenues were $3,076 million, down 20% year over year. The top line fell short of our revenue estimate of $3,710.4 million. Sales drop of devices and accessories, owing to lower postpaid upgrades and prepaid sales and longer device lifecycles, impacted the top line in this segment.

Other revenues were $262 million, relatively flat compared with the prior-year quarter’s tally of $261 million.
Other Details
Total operating expenses decreased to $15,656 million from $18,196 million in the year-ago quarter. Consequently, operating income rose to $3,596 million from $1,281 million. T-Mobile recorded a core adjusted EBITDA of $7,547 million compared with $6,728 million a year ago driven by greater service revenues, lower cost of services and equipment sales.
Cash Flow & Liquidity
In the September quarter, T-Mobile generated $5,294 million of cash from operating activities compared with $4,391 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted free cash flow was $4,003 million, up from $2,065 million due to an improvement in operating cash flow and lower cash purchases of property and equipment.

As of Sep 30, 2023, the company had $5,030 million in cash and cash equivalents, with $70,365 million of long-term debt. During the quarter, it repurchased 19.3 million shares for $2.7 billion.
Outlook
T-Mobile has raised its guidance for 2023. The company currently expects postpaid net customer additions between 5.7 million and 5.9 million, up from 5.6 million and 5.9 million expected earlier. Core adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be between $29 billion and $29.2 billion, up from $28.9-$29.2 billion. It anticipates cash from operating activities within $18.3-$18.5 billion, up from $18-18.3 billion.

TMUS upgraded the lower range of adjusted free cash flow from $13.2-$13.6 billion to $13.4-$13.6 billion. It also raised the estimated range of capital expenditure to $9.6-9.8 billion from $9.5-9.7 billion.

PINS is scheduled to report third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 30, after the closing bell. The company pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 66.19%, on average. In the last reported quarter, it reported an earnings surprise of 75%.

The company is adopting multiple strategies to foster deeper brand-customer engagement on the platform. It has introduced a wide range of enhancements in automated tools to improve the effectiveness of ad campaigns and enhance revenue potential for retailers. An approach to improve personalization on the platform will likely drive user engagement and result in a top-line expansion year over year during the quarter.
Factors at Play
During the quarter, Pinterest introduced various product updates and new features that enable advertisers and agencies to better connect with 465 million monthly users. The premium spotlight feature brings premium advertising spaces on the platform to enhance ad visibility. The company has extended this feature from search results to home feed, and it will enable advertisers to reach users from the moment they access the platform.

The quiz ad features improve personalization on the platforms. It allows brands to incorporate three questions per quiz, and the insights guide consumers toward more informed decisions. These initiatives are likely to have translated into higher revenues in the quarter.

In the quarter under review, Pinterest enhanced the capabilities of its automated business tools, including Pinterest Business Manager. The tools are designed to assist agencies to better manage their client presence on the platform. The advanced feature includes a comprehensive business dashboard to efficiently assess the impact of ad investments. The latest audience-sharing feature will facilitate the development of effective tactics for targeting audiences. The company is also developing a new tool called Creative Studio, which will allow the swift creation of lifestyle images for the brand’s product pins.

Pinterest has also been undertaking various initiatives to boost shoppability on the platform. The company has added direct links with Mobile deep links on the platform. Direct Links streamline users’ journey from discovering a product to checkout and also improve the sales conversion rate for the retailers. With this feature, users can access the retailer’s website with a single click through a Pinterest ad, reducing the overall steps required for purchase.

The company is strongly emphasizing e-commerce integration to open up new revenue opportunities for retailers. It has collaborated with Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Adobe Commerce native applications to expand its e-commerce ecosystem. Such initiatives are likely to have had a favorable impact on the company’s third-quarter earnings.

Our estimate for average revenues per user (ARPU) from the United States and Canada is pegged at $6.30. Our estimate for Europe’s ARPU is pegged at $0.90. Per our estimate, monthly active users (MAUs) from the United States and Canada are expected at 95 million in the third quarter. MAUs from Europe are approximated to be 125.3 million. MAUs from the rest of the world are estimated at 239 million.

For the September quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $743 million, suggesting an increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $685 million. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share is pegged at 21 cents, up from 11 cents reported in the prior year.

2023-10-30 00:00:00+00:00,7 Stocks You Better Be Buying on Every Single Dip,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-you-better-be-buying-on-every-single-dip,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
With rising interest rates, explosive geopolitical tensions, the potential for recession, soaring inflation, and many Americans struggling, pessimism rules the roost. However, don’t let it chase you from the markets. Instead, as Warren Buffett says, be “greedy when others are fearful,” and consider these top stocks to buy on the dip.
Or, as he explained at an annual shareholder meeting: “During such scary periods, you should never forget two things: First, widespread fear is your friend as an investor because it serves up bargain purchases. Second, personal fear is your enemy. It will also be unwarranted,” as quoted by MarketWatch.
In short, while others run scared, consider top stocks to buy on the dip.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Weakness has become an opportunity in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). After running from about $150 to $500 this year, Nvidia pulled back to about $405 thanks to the broad market pullback, but now it’s one of the premium stocks to buy on the dip.
Now oversold on relative strength, MACD and Williams’ %R I’d like to see the tech giant retest $500 again shortly. Longer-term, NVDA is a $600 stock.
Better, earnings went through the roof. Adjusted EPS of $2.70 a share came in above expectations for $2.08. Revenue jumped 101% year over year to $13.5 billion, which was also above expectations for $11.2 billion.
For the current quarter, the company expects to see revenue of about $16 billion, which is also ahead of expectations. NVDA also announced plans to buyback $25 billion in stock.
Occidental Petroleum (OXY)

Many times, when Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) dips, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway will buy so consider this one of the best Buffet stocks to buy on the dip.
In fact, the firm just bought another 3.9 million shares, increasing its stake to 228 million shares, which is worth about $14.5 billion. That now gives Buffett a 25.8% stake in Occidental Petroleum.
“Buffett probably isn’t done building his stake in the company, given that Berkshire Hathaway has received the green light from regulators to own up to 50% of the company,” as noted by Business Insider.
MicroStrategy (MSTR)
Source: DCStockPhotography / Shutterstock.com
In hopes of a Bitcoin ETF, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is back up to $34,700. And as long as BTC can continue to rocket higher, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) will follow.
In fact, from a current price of $406.76, I’d like to see MSTR test $500 again near-term. It’s another of the top stocks to buy on the dip. That’s because MSTR now owns about $4.68 billion worth of Bitcoin. So, the higher the value of BTC, the higher the potential value of MSTR. 
According to CoinDesk.com, “MicroStrategy now holds approximately 158,245 BTC, which were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.68 billion at an average purchase price of roughly $29,582 per bitcoin.
Take-Two Interactive (TTWO)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) is another of the stocks to buy on the dip, especially as the company nears the release of its hotly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI.
Even before its release, analysts believe it could see at least $1 billion at launch, and sell around 25 million copies initially. 
“In fiscal 2025, we expect to enter this new era by launching several groundbreaking titles that we believe will set new standards in our industry and enable us to achieve over $8 billion in net bookings and over $1 billion in adjusted unrestricted operating cashflow,” said company CEO Strauss Zelnick.
Analysts like TTWO here, too. JP Morgan, for example, just raised its price target on the stock to $165 from $162, with an overweight rating. The firm noted, “The company’s fiscal 2025 guidance for $8B-plus in bookings implies a substantial ramp-up in content before March 2025.”
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) should be bought on every dip – especially ahead of the 2023 holidays. According to Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), online holiday sales are expected to reach $228.1 billion this year, a 4.8% jump year over year. 
The report also estimates that about 51% of online spending will be done on mobile devices, as well. In addition, according to Deloitte, e-commerce sales will rise between 10.3% and 12.8% this year. All of which is solid news for companies like Amazon.
Analysts at DA Davidson just raised their price target on AMZN to $157 from $150. Truist also raised its target to $176. Evercore ISI also raised its target to $195 from $190. All after AMZN posted solid earnings. EPS came in at 94 cents, as compared to expectations for 58 cents. Revenue of $143.1 billion was also above expectations for $141.4 billion.
While Amazon Web Services slightly missed expectations for $23.2 billion, with a print of $23.1 billion, CEO Andy Jassy is optimistic, especially with generative artificial intelligence likely to drive billions of dollars of revenue to it. 
Agree Realty (ADC)
Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock
Agree Realty (NYSE:ADC) is a beaten-down real estate investment trust trading at a 52-week low. Not only does it currently yield 5.46%, but some of its top clients are its high-grade tenants, including AutoZone(NYSE:AZO), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Target (NYSE:TGT), and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), for example. 
As of June, the company’s portfolio consisted of 2,004 properties located in 49 states and contained approximately 41.7 million square feet of gross leasable area. Insiders are also buying.
Board member John Rakolta bought about 30,000 shares for just under $1.9 million, as I also noted on Oct. 1. CEO Joey Agree bought 10,000 shares. Executive chairman and founder Richard Agree bought about 11,751 shares for just under $740,000.
Plus, consider this. The REIT owns retail properties that secured by triple net leases, where the tenant pays the property expenses such as real estate taxes, building insurance, and maintenance. All in addition to rent and utilities.
In addition, with properties leased to grocery, home improvement, dollar stores, and drug stores, it’s less susceptible to recession.
Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)
Source: Maxx-Studio/ShutterStock.com
Or, if you want to diversify at a low cost, consider a beaten-down exchange-traded fund like the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK), especially with the artificial intelligence and machine learning booms in their infancy.
With an expense ratio of 0.10%, the ETF tracks the price and yield performance of the Technology Select Sector Index.
After dropping from about $172.50 to $161.12, the XLK ETF appears to have caught strong support again. From here, I’d like to see it rally back to $177.50.
I should also note the XLK ETF is technically oversold on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. The last time it was this oversold, it bounced from about $160 to a high of $172.83.

2023-10-31 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia shares drop after report of canceled China orders,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-shares-drop-after-report-of-canceled-china-orders,"By Chibuike Oguh
NEW YORK, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Shares of Nvidia Corp NVDA.O dropped by about 5% to a near five-month low on Tuesday following a Wall Street Journal report that the artificial intelligence (AI) giant may be forced to cancel up to $5 billion worth of advanced chip orders to China in compliance with new U.S. government restrictions.
Nvidia was notified last week that AI chip orders scheduled for delivery next year to major Chinese technology companies, including Alibaba Group 9988.HK, TikTok owner-ByteDance and Baidu 9888.HK, are subject to the latest export restrictions announced by the U.S. Commerce Department, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
Nvidia's stock fell to as low as $392.30, down 4.7%, to the lowest level since mid-June. The stock, which has been one of the major drivers of this year's 22% gain in the Nasdaq index, is now down nearly 20% from its record high close of $493.55 reached on Aug. 31. It was last down 2.09%.
""The stock is getting oversold,"" said Tom Plumb, chief executive and lead portfolio manager at Plumb Funds, which has Nvidia as one of its largest holdings.
""Previously, Nvidia has said this is not going to have a short-term impact but it's more in the long term. We still expect a pretty strong quarter and think it's a great long-term holding, although we are not adding any new positions because of the volatility,"" Plumb added.
A Nvidia spokesperson said there is ""high demand"" for its advanced chips, which often require significant lead time to build, and that it is working to allocate orders to its ""wide range of customers"" in the United States and elsewhere.
""These new export controls will not have a meaningful impact in the near term,"" the Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement.
Earlier this month, the Biden administration imposed export restrictions on shipments of more AI chips designed by Nvidia and others to China, a move designed to stop Beijing from receiving cutting-edge U.S. technologies to strengthen its military.
The new rules go into effect in November and included export controls to countries including Iran and Russia.
""I think Nvidia is priced for perfection and any trip off can have major impact when you have a stock that is trading at 20 times sales and 40 times earnings,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital in New York.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

One stock in particular saw some major gains. Last week marked the S&P 500’s and Nasdaq Composite’s best week thus far since November 2022. The recent monthly jobs report also helped boost stocks.
RBC Capital Markets’ head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina is quoted in CNBC as writing: “The stock market has had a strong start to November.” She added: “the move seems deserved in light of what we’re seeing in most, though admittedly not all, of our sentiment indicators.”

2023-11-07 00:00:00+00:00,ADTRAN's (ADTN) Q3 Earnings Miss Estimates on Lower Revenues,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/adtrans-adtn-q3-earnings-miss-estimates-on-lower-revenues,"ADTRAN Holdings Inc. ADTN reported soft third-quarter 2023 results, wherein both the top line and bottom line fell short of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company recorded a top-line contraction year over year due to lackluster demand trends in the Network Solutions business. Macroeconomic challenges and inventory corrections continued to impact customer spending during the quarter. However, management is focusing on cost optimization and enhancing its operating model to ensure higher long-term shareholder returns.
Net Income
On a GAAP basis, the company incurred a net loss of $72.7 million or a loss of 93 cents per share compared with a net loss of $41.9 million or 57 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. A sharp decline in net sales impacted the bottom line during the quarter.

Non-GAAP net loss was $10.8 million or a loss of 14 cents per share against an income of $7.7 million or 11 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The loss was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents.

ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. Quote
Revenues
Net sales during the quarter declined to $272.3 million from $340.7 million in the prior-year quarter, owing to weak demand trends. Revenues came below the lower end of the company’s guidance range. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $285 million.

Network Solutions contributed $228.6 million in revenues compared with $304.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The persistence of an unfavorable macroeconomic environment and inventory adjustments constrained the capex spending from customers. Forex volatility also impacted net sales derived from outside of the United States. Nevertheless, the company witnessed healthy traction and expanded market share in some of its product categories. Services and Support revenues stood at $43.8 million, up from $35.8 million.
Other Details
Gross margin on a GAAP basis was 27.3%, down from 33.8% in the year-ago quarter. A downturn in net sales, combined with an inventory write-off of approximately $21 million, affected the gross margin. Operating loss was reported at $89.3 million compared with the previous-year quarter’s tally of $48 million.
Cash Flow & Liquidity
In the first nine months of 2023, ADTRAN utilized $29.3 million of cash for operating activities compared with a cash utilization of $42.7 million in the prior-year period. As of Sep 30, 2023, the company had $116.1 million in cash and cash equivalents with $26.8 million of deferred compensation liability.
Outlook
For the fourth quarter of 2023, ADTRAN anticipates net sales in the range of $210-$240 million, with non-GAAP operating margin trending between negative 7% to a flat trajectory. Management expects that the ongoing macro uncertainty will likely impact customer spending well into 2024. To mitigate the effects on shareholders, the company is undertaking a business efficiency program to reduce expenses by $90 million by the end of 2024.
Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider

Without contest, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the best artificial intelligence (AI) stock on the current market. No matter how you slice it, Nvidia has the best chips for AI and machine learning on today’s market. And undeniably, the company has done the work to get to where it is today and deserves the accolades. 
But tremendous accomplishments and success breed competition, particularly in high-stakes realms like AI. It would be foolish to assume that Nvidia doesn’t have real competition and that its dominance is unassailable. It isn’t. Some of the biggest names in the semiconductor space aren’t far behind. Meanwhile, other tech giants are taking aim as well. 
Here are three Nvidia competitor stocks that represent companies with the potential to beat the giant at its own game.
Intel (INTC)

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has a chance to beat Nvidia in certain respects. It’s pretty well known that Nvidia’s H100 chips are the industry standard for raw AI performance. And Intel’s Gaudi 2 chips pretty much fall behind them by any benchmark. 
So as long as firms demand the absolute best AI chips Nvidia is going to continue to dominate. However, there’s reason to believe that won’t always be the case. While firms have vied to secure the absolute best AI chips during 2023, there were so many unknowns overall that securing anything but Nvidia’s leading chips was viewed as too risky.
I’d argue that isn’t as much the case as 2023 winds down and won’t be into the new year. Enterprises are better aware of what their AI needs are at this point. That’s where Intel has an advantage. Its Gaudi 2 chips are a strong competitor to H100 chips on a performance per cost basis. In other words, Gaudi 2 chips might be exactly what a lot of firms need moving forward: AI functionality at a more reasonable price. 
Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL)

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL), the corporation behind Google, is a strong competitor across tech. That shouldn’t surprise investors given its size and the vast resources the company has at its disposal. So it then also shouldn’t surprise investors to know that Alphabet believes it is competitive in the AI chip space. 
At least, that’s what the tech giant said earlier in the year. Alphabet stated that the tensor processing units (TPUs) it used to train its supercomputer is roughly 80% faster than an AI system trained on Nvidia’s A100 chips. The problem is that the A100 chip is now a legacy chip, and Nvidia released its H100 chips after that date. H100 chips are 9X faster than the A100 chip they replaced. That means that Alphabet’s TPU chips are much slower than Nvidia’s leading AI chips. 
Nevertheless, the comparison and assertion by Alphabet should raise some eyebrows. Alphabet has such vast resources at its disposal that it would surprise no one if the firm directed its attention to besting H100 chips — and actually succeeded. 
AMD (AMD) 
Source: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com
Machine learning is the precursor to AI, and it’s also where AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) can make up ground it has lost to Nvidia. 
Earlier this year, a test undertaken by MosaicML showed that AMD’s chips are roughly 80% as capable as Nvidia’s for machine learning purposes. Machine learning is effectively synonymous with artificial intelligence for all intents and purposes. In other words, AMD is 80% as strong as Nvidia in AI. 
Thus, the argument that favors AMD is very similar to that for Intel’s Gaudi 2 chips. As time goes on, its chips are likely to appear more and more suitable to a broader range of clients. Further, there’s always a slim chance that AMD will close the gap between itself and Nvidia. To be honest, that seems unlikely given everything that I’ve read about the skill of Nvidia’s talent base in comparison to that of AMD. Regardless, AMD can usurp market share from Nvidia by simply being ‘good enough.’

With the Nasdaq taking investors on a roller coaster ride this year, many have sought refuge in mega-cap tech names like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, some of the best bargains right now are in smaller semiconductor stocks flying under Wall Street’s radar. While not rivals to titans like Nvidia or AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), these chip makers boast massive growth potential and trade at bargain basement-level valuations. Snapping up shares now could deliver outsized returns in 2023 and beyond.
Of course, small caps carry elevated risks, especially when considering looming recession fears. But with valuations compressed, many of these semiconductor stocks are trading near historic lows. Their risk-reward outlooks appear skewed to the upside for patient investors with a long-term focus.
Rather than chasing over-extended momentum stocks, it pays to discover under-followed names in beaten-down sectors. While semiconductor demand remains robust long-term, inventory gluts and falling memory chip prices have stung in the near term. This dynamic has created bargains in many small-cap chip stocks.
Atomera (ATOM)

Atomera (NASDAQ:ATOM) is one of the most beaten-down names in the semiconductor space. Its stock has plunged nearly 87% from 2021 highs. However, with shares trading near multi-year lows, the stock’s risk/reward is skewed sharply higher for long-term investors. A strategic partnership provides major validation of Atomera’s technology and could open the floodgates for new licensing deals.
Atomera’s core technology is Mears Silicon Technology (MST), which enhances semiconductor performance by modifying materials at the atomic level. MST improves speed, power efficiency, and reliability without requiring changes to manufacturing tools. It has broad applications in analog, logic, and memory chips.
Despite strong customer validation, Atomera has struggled to generate meaningful revenue. The company’s business model centers on upfront licensing fees and royalties, but deals have been slow to materialize. However, a landmark partnership with semiconductor giant STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) changes that narrative.
In April, STM licensed MST for use across multiple next-generation products. While financial terms weren’t disclosed, this deal will provide vital production validation and credibility. As STM integrates MST into its manufacturing process, investors will increasingly realize that MST is a proven solution ready for mass adoption.
Royalties from STM shipments will start flowing in over the next 18-24 months. I estimate these could reach tens of millions annually within three years, meaningful for a company with negligible revenue today. More importantly, success with STM should open up enormous new licensing opportunities.
Its balance sheet is solid, with $20 million in cash against minimal debt. Thus, I don’t see any liquidity issues ahead for at least two years. The sole Wall Street analyst with a price target of $13 per share implies almost 150% upside in one year for ATOM stock.
JinkoSolar (JKS)
Source: Lutsenko_Oleksandr / Shutterstock.com
JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS) is not a pure-play chip stock, but the company is a major producer of silicon wafers for solar modules. It also manufactures solar cells, panels, and other components critical to the industry. While the company deals in commoditized products, JinkoSolar’s scale and low-cost manufacturing in China give it a competitive advantage.
With its stock down 53% from 2022 highs, JinkoSolar trades at bargain basement valuations despite strong fundamentals. It has earned $3.25 per share ($12.2 expected for all of 2023) over the past quarter but trades around just $35 per share. Thus, shares fetch less than 3-times forward earnings and less than 0.11-times forward sales.
Revenue surged nearly 60% last quarter to $4.36 billion as polysilicon costs retreated. This drove gross margins to 19.3%, up from 15.7% last year. Net income is up 141% year-over-year to $181.4 million. Profitability should continue improving as lower materials costs boost margins. JinkoSolar expects full-year module shipments of 70-75 gigawatts.
Of course, JinkoSolar’s debt-heavy balance sheet is a risk factor to consider. However, the company is already generating positive free cash flow while reducing leverage. As profits grow, its balance sheet will steadily improve. China is in a deflationary environment which will lead to looser monetary policy, and we are looking at interest rates likely near or at their peak in most countries. Regardless, the company is managing to churn out impressive profit metrics, and I’m not too worried.
ACM Research (ACMR)
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com
ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) manufactures wet-cleaning tools for semiconductor wafers at various manufacturing steps. Its proprietary technologies optimize efficiency and purity at mature process nodes. Revenue is split between logic and memory chip makers inside and outside of China. Indeed,
2023 has been volatile for ACMR stock, which has tumbled 19% from its October high. However, the company’s financial performance remains rock-solid. Revenue grew 26% year-over-year last quarter, driving a 68% earnings beat. The consensus estimate calls for 37% sales growth this year.
Despite moderating growth in the global WFE market, ACMR continues gaining share. Its niche wet-cleaning tools are critical for producers focused on high-volume mature nodes. With expertise in advanced packaging, ACM Research also provides mission-critical technologies. Trading around 12-times earnings at this growth rate seems too cheap. The company is estimated to triple revenue by 2030 by capturing more business in China, and perhaps, globally.
In the near-term, macro headwinds persist. Lingering supply chain constraints have delayed some tool deliveries. A slowdown in China adds uncertainty and may temporarily dampen orders. However, these issues don’t alter ACMR’s long-term trajectory. ACM Research operates in an essential subset of the semiconductor industry. As new fabs are built globally, demand for wafer cleaning tools will continue rising. But most importantly, as sanctions against China’s semiconductor imports begin to roll in, ACMR seems well-positioned to receive massive amounts of domestic investment. The average Wall Street analyst sees nearly 50% upside here in the next year.

2023-11-14 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Super Micro Computer, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel Rallied Today",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-super-micro-computer-advanced-micro-devices-and,"Shares of artificial intelligence beneficiaries Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) were rallying today, up 14.9%, 2.7%, and 3.1%, respectively.
AMD was initiated with a ""buy"" rating at a sell-side firm today, but its move higher was likely due to the lower inflation print this morning, which lifted most stocks across the board.
Semiconductor and AI hardware stocks are thought to be highly cyclical. The prospect of easing inflation and therefore lower interest rates is especially good for these sectors, barring a recession.
AMD gets a buy as lower inflation could extend the AI boom
The day started off especially well for AMD, which garnered a ""buy"" rating at sell-side firm Roth MKM. The firm has a $125 price target on AMD given its growth opportunities, especially in the data center.
AMD stock recently rose on the back of CEO Lisa Su projecting at least $2 billion in revenue next year for AMD's MI300 AI accelerator, its new chip that it hopes will rival Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs) and make inroads into the red-hot AI data center market.
Intel also hopes to make inroads in the data center, not only with the upcoming release of more advanced data center central processing units (CPUs) but also for its Gaudi AI accelerators. Intel is also embarking on an ambitious plan to construct a foundry to serve chip customers besides itself and may also benefit from potential AI customers. That build-out, however, will take a lot of capital.
Today, a lower-than-expected consumer price index (CPI) reading lit a fire under virtually all stocks, as the new reading sparked hopes the Federal Reserve is now done with interest rate hikes and may even begin lowering them, hopefully without the economy having to enter a recession.
That would greatly benefit Intel, which has seen its profits squeezed and cash flow go negative, as its foundry investments have coincided with a deep slump in its main PC processor business that generates most of its cash flow.
So, a lower-rate environment would not only benefit sales of big-ticket items such as PCs but may also allow Intel to raise money at lower interest rates. Recently, Intel announced it was planning a sale of part of its FPGA business. Thanks to lower rates and a potentially improved economic outlook, Intel may be able to raise more money from that asset sale as well.

Finally, Super Micro Computer has already been a huge winner in 2023, up 144%. But to start the day, it still found itself about 30% below its all-time high reached this year. Super Micro is seeing a huge growth and profit acceleration this year, as its energy-efficient and highly customizable servers have been big beneficiaries of the AI boom.
Super Micro is now a $15 billion market-cap company, but its stock is volatile and is often grouped in with small-cap-stocks. The Russell 2000 small-cap index was up over 5% today, as stocks perceived as ""riskier"" rallied harder, given the relief in interest rates.
Skeptics for Super Micro's year-to-date rally have also piled on, with the stock's short interest above 10% of the company's public-share float as of the end of October.
At just 27 times trailing earnings and a low-teens multiple on this year's expectations, Super Micro has never traded at a demanding valuation. Still, it's possible those who feared higher rates for a longer period of time anticipated higher rates would eventually curtail investment in artificial intelligence. After all, AI chips and servers are very expensive, even though they may become table stakes for any company hoping to outdo rivals going forward.
Yet with lower interest rates now a higher probability thanks to today's lower inflation reading, that could sustain or increase AI investment on the part of big cloud providers and others. So that sunnier outlook, perhaps with some short covering on top, fueled Super Micro's massive rally today.
Chip stocks are volatile but are long-term winners
Many investors steer clear of semiconductor stocks because of their extreme volatility. However, if one chooses the right chip companies for a portfolio and takes a long-term perspective, many chip stocks have outperformed the markets and even the overall tech sector over the past decade. Therefore, those stocks at the forefront of the AI revolution are a must-add for young growth investors' portfolios.
While one needs a strong stomach to weather bad years like 2022, today was a good example of why these stocks are great choices for the risk-on investors with lots of time to compound their wealth.

2023-11-15 00:00:00+00:00,"Microsoft introduces its own chips for AI, with eye on cost",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsoft-introduces-its-own-chips-for-ai-with-eye-on-cost,"By Stephen Nellis
Nov 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft MSFT.O on Wednesday announced a duo of custom-designed computing chips, joining other big tech firms that - faced with the high cost of delivering artificial intelligence services - are bringing key technologies in-house.
Microsoft said it does not plan to sell the chips but instead will use them to power its own subscription software offerings and as part of its Azure cloud computing service.
At its Ignite developer conference in Seattle, Microsoft introduced a new chip, called Maia, to speed up AI computing tasks and provide a foundation for its $30-a-month ""Copilot"" service for business software users, as well as for developers who want to make custom AI services.
The Maia chip was designed to run large language models, a type of AI software that underpins Microsoft's Azure OpenAI service and is a product of Microsoft's collaboration with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.
Microsoft and other tech giants such as Alphabet are grappling with the high cost of delivering AI services, which can be 10 times greater than for traditional services such as search engines.
Microsoft executives have said they plan to tackle those costs by routing nearly all of the company's sprawling efforts to put AI in its products through a common set of foundational AI models. The Maia chip, they said, is optimized for that work.
""We think this gives us a way that we can provide better solutions to our customers that are faster and lower cost and higher quality,"" said Scott Guthrie, the executive vice president of Microsoft's cloud and AI group.
Microsoft also said that next year it will offer its Azure customers cloud services that run on the newest flagship chips from Nvidia NVDA.O and Advanced Micro Devices.
""This is not something that's displacing Nvidia,"" said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of analyst firm Creative Strategies.
He said the Maia chip would allow Microsoft to sell AI services in the cloud until personal computers and phones are powerful enough to handle them.
""Microsoft has a very different kind of core opportunity here because they're making a lot of money per user for the services,"" Bajarin said.
Microsoft's second chip announced Tuesday is designed to be both an internal cost saver and an answer to Microsoft's chief cloud rival, Amazon Web Services.
Named Cobalt, the new chip is a central processing unit (CPU) made with technology from Arm Holdings O9Ty.F. Microsoft disclosed on Wednesday that it has already been testing Cobalt to power Teams, its business messaging tool.
But Microsoft's Guthrie said his company also wants to sell direct access to Cobalt to compete with the ""Graviton"" series of in-house chips offered by Amazon AMZN.O.
""We are designing our Cobalt solution to ensure that we are very competitive both in terms of performance as well as price-to-performance (compared with Amazon's chips),"" Guthrie said.
Microsoft gave few technical details that would allow gauging the chips' competitiveness versus those of traditional chipmakers. Rani Borkar, corporate vice president for Azure hardware systems and infrastructure, said both are made with 5-nanometer manufacturing technology from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW.
He added that the Maia chip would be strung together with standard Ethernet network cabling, rather than a more expensive custom Nvidia networking technology that Microsoft used in the supercomputers it built for OpenAI.
""You will see us going a lot more the standardization route,"" Borkar told Reuters.

NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise

GenAI Boom to Drive the Top Line
Though AI has been around for years, the meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT has captivated the world’s attention on the power of generative AI to augment human capability, suggesting that the AI boom may just get started.
Generative AI is a type of AI technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. It is driven by a large language model, which means it uses a lot of data to understand and generate conversations.
The growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $667.96 billion by 2030, according to a new report by Fortune Business Insights. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 47.5% from 2023 to 2030.
The adoption of ChatGPT among enterprises has already proven generative AI technology’s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.
However, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.
NVIDIA’s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises. During the first-quarter fiscal 2024earnings conference call the company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, already stated that existing data centers are insufficiently equipped to handle growing AI workloads.
NVIDIA’s GPUs are already being applied in AI models, which is expanding its footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing. The generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. NVIDIA expects its third-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to reach $16 billion from $5.93 billion in the year-ago quarter, largely driven by surging AI investments across the data center end market.

BRUSSELS, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Regulators in the European Union, China and France have asked for information on Nvidia's NVDA.O graphic cards, with more requests expected in the future, the U.S. chip giant said in a regulatory filing.
Nvidia is the world's largest maker of chips used both for artificial intelligence and for computer graphics. Demand for its chips jumped following the release of the generative AI application ChatGPT late last year.
The California-based company has a market share of around 80% via its chips and other hardware and its powerful software that runs them.
Its graphics cards (GPUs) are high-performance devices that enable powerful graphics rendering and processing for use in video editing, video gaming and other complex computing operations.
The company said this has attracted regulatory interest around the world.
""For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets,"" Nvidia said in a regulatory filing dated Nov. 21.
The French watchdog raided Nvidia's local office in September, a person familiar with the matter had told Reuters.
""We have also received requests for information from regulators in the European Union and China regarding our sales of GPUs and our efforts to allocate supply, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in the future,"" Nvidia said in the filing.
Separately, Nvidia has delayed the launch of a new China-focused AI chip, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

2023-11-27 00:00:00+00:00,Here's the Top AI Stock to Buy Before 2023 Ends,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-the-top-ai-stock-to-buy-before-2023-ends,"The start of the holiday shopping season reminds us that 2023 is coming to an end. And what a year it has been! Many tech stocks have skyrocketed this year as a result of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, which seems to have just begun. According to Statista, the AI market could grow to be worth nearly $2 trillion by 2030.
While tech industry titans like Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) have become the obvious choices to bet on AI growth, investors looking to capitalize on this technological wave should also take a look at Super Micro Computer's (SMCI) fundamentals. The stock is up an eye-catching 262% year-to-date, outperforming the Nasdaq Composite Index's ($NASX) 36% gain. Nonetheless, Wall Street believes the stock has more room to run.

What Does Super Micro Computer Do?
As the world hurtles into a new technological era led by AI and machine learning, many tech companies are raising the stakes in the game. Super Micro Computer is renowned for its energy-efficient servers with innovative features such as liquid cooling, building-block architecture, and storage solutions. The company's innovative hardware offerings include high-density servers and specialized hardware accelerators. 
It serves the expanding needs of cloud and edge computing, 5G networks, the Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and AI servers in over 100 countries. Super Micro has a long-standing partnership with prominent players like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel (INTC)
SMCI's Strengthening Fundamentals
Between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2023, Super Micro Computer’s revenue has grown from $3.5 billion to $7.1 billion, while earnings have increased from $1.39 to $11.43 per share. Even in the company's most recent first quarter of fiscal 2024, the results were impressive.
Despite supply constraints in AI graphic processing units (GPUs), total revenue of $2.1 billion came in higher than $1.85 billion in the prior-year quarter, and surpassed estimates by $57 million. Additionally, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.43 beat analysts’ estimates by $0.18.
Due to its rapid global expansion and high demand, the company recently announced that it can now deliver 5,000 liquid-cooled racks per month, up from its initial target of 4,000. At its current utilization rate of about 60% from its U.S. headquarters and Taiwan facility, the company expects to easily generate $18 billion in annual revenue.
Furthermore, the company opened a low-cost manufacturing facility in Malaysia this year, which it believes will result in a better cost structure and higher volume. Super Micro anticipates a ""seasonally strong"" second quarter. 
Driven by a strong start to fiscal 2024, management raised the guidance for revenue for the full year to fall between $10 billion and $11 billion. Meanwhile, analysts’ prediction of revenue of $10.8 billion, a growth of 52% year-over-year, is also in line with management’s forecast. For the fiscal year, adjusted EPS could rise by 49% to $17.59.
While SMCI is not as prominent as some industry giants, its focus on niche markets and specialization in AI hardware infrastructure position it for a bright future.
What's The Stock Price Prediction For SMCI?
Super Micro Computer stock remains a “strong buy” in the analyst community. Five of the seven analysts who cover the stock rate it as a ""strong buy,"" while two rate it as a ""hold."" Following strong first-quarter results, Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann increased the target price for SMCI to $430 from $375, while sticking to his “buy” rating.
On average, the Street’s target price for SMCI stands at $360.43, implying an upside potential of 21%.
www.barchart.com
The stock trades at 14 times forward earnings and 1.2 times forward sales. Analysts predict fiscal revenue and earnings growth of 16% and 19%, respectively.
Based on its fiscal 2025 growth estimates and AI-driven opportunities in the coming years, SMCI's valuation seems reasonable.
The Final Word on Super Micro Computer
Given the massive growth projected for AI servers, Super Micro Computer is poised to be a leading player in the space. CEO Charles Liang is confident the company can achieve $20 billion in annual revenue in a “couple of years.” This represents a massive jump from the estimated $10 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024. 
Investors eyeing growth opportunities in the AI realm should consider holding a stake in this hypergrowth stock. Despite the outsized gains this year, I believe there is much more upside to SMCI in the near term.

2023-11-28 00:00:00+00:00,Why Microsoft Stock Is Cheaper Than It Looks,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-microsoft-stock-is-cheaper-than-it-looks,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to find ways to reinvent itself some 37 years after its initial public offering. A $2.8 trillion business finds it challenging to swiftly alter its direction, but the tech giant manages to assert itself as a powerful force.
Its performance this year led it to be included in the group of tech stocks dubbed the Magnificent 7 that carried the stock market higher. Even with the recent pullback, Microsoft stock is still up 57% year to date (YTD). In comparison, the S&P 500 is up just 19% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index is up 46%.
It may be an industry behemoth, but its swift response to the recent turmoil that shook OpenAI shows the tech leader is capable of transforming itself to meet its future needs. The stock trades at deceptively lofty levels. Hence, the market really undervalues Microsoft stock.
Behind the AI hype
Microsoft was not going to let the tumult that erupted at artificial intelligence (AI) outfit OpenAI undermine the $13 billion it invested in the company. It immediately hired ousted CEO Sam Altman but also helped engineer his return to OpenAI. Then it made the board of directors that fired him resign.
Aside from the money at stake, the reason for Microsoft’s quick and granular involvement was that AI is critical to its future. The software company integrated OpenAI’s generative AI into many of its products and services. It sees the direction the technology is headed and aims to be at the forefront of the revolution.
OpenAI’s generative AI chatbot ChatGPT became a critical component of Microsoft’s Bing search engine. Also, it installed it within its Teams collaborative tools while making it integral to the Azure Cloud Services platform.
Additionally, Microsoft just unveiled two new chips specifically designed for AI, the Azure Maia 100 and Cobalt 100. They are the first custom silicon chips designed for its cloud infrastructure. These chips aim to reduce the company’s dependence on Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI chips.
Head in the clouds
Cloud services are also a mission-critical platform for Microsoft. It is the second largest cloud stock with a 23% share of the market. That trails Amazon‘s (NASDAQ:AMZN) 32% share but is more than double Alphabet‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) 11%. Yet, of the big three cloud stocks, Microsoft is the only one steadily growing. It increased its share by one percentage point over each of the past three quarters while Amazon and Google either remained flat or lost share.
Segment revenue jumped 23% to $32 billion in Microsoft’s fiscal first quarter. Gross margins widened to 73%, making the cloud business an extremely profitable venture.
A financial powerhouse
Microsoft is hitting on all cylinders. Cliche, perhaps, but true. Currency-adjusted revenue jumped 12% to $56.5 billion but operating profits rocketed 25% higher to $27 billion. Net profits were up 26% to over $22 billion. 
The tech giant produced $63 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the last 12 months, 6% more than for all of fiscal 2023. Even though capital expenditures keep rising, operating cash flows grow faster. It’s feasible to believe Microsoft will soon produce $100 billion in FCF annually. The growth already allows it to continuously increase its dividend every year.
In September, Microsoft raised the payout 10% to $0.75 per share. Since initiating the payout in 2014, it has increased the dividend by 10% a year on average.
Is Microsoft stock a buy?
Even at these elevated valuations, Microsoft is not overvalued. Although the stock trades at 36 times earnings, 13 times sales, and 44x FCF, sales and margins are still expanding. And, it keeps entering new verticals to create more opportunities for itself. Yet, its current valuation ratios exceed historical averages. Over the past 10 years, Microsoft’s PE has averaged around 30, with price-to-sales ratio at 8 and its P/FCF 26.
Regardless, I remain bullish on MSFT stock. AI is opening new doors for the tech leader. Its cloud services give it the financial wherewithal to expand while still rewarding shareholders with dividends and share buybacks. Maybe you’ll want to dollar-cost average into the stock, but you definitely want to be a part of this ongoing growth story.

2023-11-30 00:00:00+00:00,3 Must-Own Stocks as Demand for AI Chips Soars,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-must-own-stocks-as-demand-for-ai-chips-soars,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Demand for artificial intelligence microchips shows no signs of slowing down. According to market research firm Gartner, by 2027, global AI chips revenue is expected to be more than double the size of the market in 2023, growing to $119.4 billion. Demand for chips is so high that many companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have announced plans to begin manufacturing their own chips going forward.
This all bodes well for the companies that specialize in the design and manufacture of the microchips and semiconductors that power the most advanced artificial intelligence models and platforms. Here are three must-own stocks as demand for AI chips soars.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM)

Few if any companies are as important to AI microchips as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM). The company, which is based in Taiwan, makes nearly three-quarters (75%) of all the microchips and semiconductors in the world. It has a near-monopoly position when it comes to fabricating chips and semis. While there are some political risks involved in TSM stock with China’s sovereign claims over Taiwan, they don’t take away from this company’s huge growth potential.
There’s an opportunity to buy TSM stock right now as it has retreated 11% from its 52-week high since the summer of this year and is currently trading 30% below the all-time high its shares reached in January 2022. For a tech company with a nearly half trillion dollar market cap, Taiwan Semi’s valuation looks cheap right now with the stock trading at 17 times future earnings estimates. And TSM stock pays a decent dividend of 46 cents per share each quarter, for a yield of 1.85%.
The median price target on TSM stock is 16% higher than where the shares currently trade.
Intel (INTC)

Hoping to give Taiwan Semiconductor a run for its money in the microchip production business is Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The company is spending billions of dollars with the goal of becoming the second largest chip foundry by 2030, behind TSMC. While Intel is investing huge sums of money to achieve its ambitions, the company’s latest financial results seem to suggest that the gamble is starting to pay off. INTC stock rose 7% in one day following the company’s Q3 print.
For this year’s third quarter, Intel reported earnings of 41 cents per share versus 22 cents that had been expected. Revenue amounted to $14.16 billion versus $13.53 billion that was anticipated. Company executives reiterated plans to cut costs by $3 billion this year and stressed that operating expenses were 15% lower than a year ago. The company’s foundry unit remains a small part of Intel’s overall business. However, the foundry business’ sales grew nearly 300% from a year ago to reach $311 million in Q3.
During anearnings callwith analysts and media, Intel’s management team said that the company is on track to catch up with Taiwan Semiconductor’s chipmaking technology by 2025. INTC stock has gained 68% this year.
Arm Holdings (ARM)

Now for the new kid on the block. That would be Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM). Not only are the British company’s microchips found in nearly every smartphone on the planet, but it just recently unveiled a new new Cortex-M52 processor that’s capable of running AI applications on the smallest Internet of Things (IOT) devices. Arm Holdings has also established a partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the world’s leading AI chip designer to develop chips for personal computers.
Arm only went public in September of this year. And while its stock has pulled back since its heavily hyped initial public offering (IPO), there’s reason to be optimistic about the company and the future of its stock. Arm’s first earnings report as a publicly traded concern contained some encouraging numbers. If nothing else, Arm is already profitable, which is more than can be said for most companies that go public these days.
The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of 36 cents, which was in line with analyst forecasts. Revenue totaled $806 million versus $744.3 million that was expected. The company’s revenue was up 28% from a year earlier, and Arm boasted that it sold more than 7.1 billion microchips during Q3 of this year. Since its market debut, ARM stock has gained 2%.

2023-12-01 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks to Buy IF the Fed Indicates a Rate Hike Pause in December,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-buy-if-the-fed-indicates-a-rate-hike-pause-in-december,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
At the time of this writing, the market is at a “will they or won’t they” crossroads. Most investors’ are wondering if the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates at its December 2023 meeting or pause. Recent market activity suggests that a Fed rate hike pause is a near certainty. But a hotter-than-expected reading on the Fed’s preferred Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index could turn that certainty into concern.
But what the heck, it’s the holiday season. Let’s be cheerful and presume the rate of inflation continues to move back towards the Fed’s preferred 2% target. That would likely be enough to keep Fed Chair Jerome Powell content to leave interest rates at their higher-for-longer levels.
That also means the newly coined “everything rally” that started at the beginning of November would continue and perhaps broaden out into 2024.
If that’s the case, now is the time to look at stocks to buy on the back of a Fed rate hike pause. Here are three candidates for you to consider.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the “Magnificent 7” stocks that kept the broader market stable during a volatile year. Yet even MSFT stock wasn’t immune from the volatility that gripped the market in September. The stock dropped about 10% in that time.
But as the saying goes: “that was then, this is now”. Microsoft has been one of the stocks leading the stock market rally, thanks to the company’s investment in the growth of generative AI.
The market began to sour on tech stocks that were promoting AI over concerns about monetization. One way Microsoft is addressing this issue is by making its own in-house AI chips. While these chips won’t put the company in direct competition with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), it will allow Microsoft to run and optimize the company’s cloud and AI architecture so clients can use AI more efficiently.
SoFi Technologies (SOFI) 
Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com
In 2022 and the better part of 2023, SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) couldn’t catch a break. Interest rates were rising in an effort to tamp down inflation. And the Biden administration was intent on forgiving all, or a hefty percentage, of student loans.
Rising interest rates affect SoFi, but less borrowing and lending is a reality even the big boys have to deal with. The student loan moratorium was acutely felt by SoFi, which built its brand on helping refinance student loans.
But SOFI stock is up 11.5% in the last month as student loan repayments have resumed. As David Moadel wrote for InvestorPlace, rising interest rates would be a key stumbling block for the stock.
Nevertheless, with the bank reporting a record number of 717,000 new member additions in the third quarter, and with a Fed rate hike pause more likely, risk-tolerant investors should see more upside in SOFI stock.
D.R. Horton (DHI) 
Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com
D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) has been on a tear in November and is trading near its 52-week high set in the summer. The resilience of homebuilder stocks, including DHI stock, in the face of rising interest rates is one of many seeming contradictions for investors in 2023.
But the issue is one of supply and demand. As individuals had the freedom to live and work wherever they wanted to, many decided that it was time for a change. But that doesn’t mean they had a home waiting for them.
The law of supply and demand dictates that new construction in many markets, particularly in the Southeast, one of the areas where D.R. Horton operates, is booming. The homebuilder has a business model that allows the company to turn homes quicker to keep inventory levels low. And the average price of a D.R. Horton home is about 10% below the national median price of $422,000.
It goes to show you that when it comes to interest rates, the known is better than the unknown. If you need a place to live, the interest rate is what it is. That fact may bring in value investors who scratched their heads at Warren Buffett’s decision to buy DHI stock earlier this year.

Dec 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended lower on Monday, interrupting last week's rally, as investors turned cautious ahead of employment data due this week that could alter expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates early next year.
The S&P 500 receded, with megacaps Microsoft MSFT.O, Apple AAPL.O, Nvidia NVDA.O and Amazon <AMZN.O> pressured by higher U.S. Treasury yields, which made returns on stocks less attractive.
Wall Street has rallied in recent weeks, buoyed by robust corporate earnings and expectations that the Fed will start cutting rates as soon as March.
The S&P 500 .SPXregistered its highest close of the year on Friday as remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the central bank's need to ""move forward carefully"" amid signs of economic softening, comments that bolstered expectations the Fed has finished raising rates.
Small-cap stocks rose on Monday, with the Russell 2000 .RUT rallying and bringing its gain this year to over 6%.
""There is a lot of chop around here that is not necessarily meaningful,"" said Tom Martin, a senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta.
""We have a really important Fed meeting coming up, and what makes it important is that all of a sudden, the market has decided that they're going to cut early next year.""
Unofficially, the S&P 500 declined 0.54% to end the session at 4,569.78 points. The Nasdaq declined 0.84% to 14,185.49 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.11% to 36,204.31 points.
Ride-hailing service Uber Technologies UBER.N rallied after an announcement on Friday it will join the S&P 500 effective Dec. 18.
Shares of Alaska Air GroupALK.N tumbled after the carrier said on Sunday it would acquire peer Hawaiian Holdings HA.O for $1.9 billion, including debt. Hawaiian's shares nearly tripled in value, helping lift the Russel index.
This week's main macroeconomic focus will be Friday's jobs report for November, which may help investors gauge the Fed's likely interest rate path, as well as the potential for a ""soft landing"" - where the Fed manages to bring inflation under control while averting a recession.
Traders widely expect the central bank will keep rates unchanged at its meeting next week. Interest rate futures suggest a 58% probability the Fed will start cutting rates by March 2024, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.
However, some analysts warn that markets have been too quick to price in lower interest rates.
Adding to declines on Monday were renewed fears about a widening of the war in Israel and Gaza after an attack on three commercial vessels in the southern Red Sea.

Dec 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended down on Wednesday, pulled lower by megacaps and energy shares as signs of a cooling jobs market reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates early next year.
The ADP National Employment report showed private payrolls increased by 103,000 jobs in November, below economists' expectation of 130,000. That provided fresh evidence of labor market weakness, a day after news of a drop in October job openings.
The latest employment data reinforced expectations the Fed's rate-hike campaign is cooling the economy.
""Right now, it's consistent with the overall trajectory of softening job growth, and so far that's not problematic because the economy is still humming along,"" said Bill Merz, head of capital markets research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

2023-12-07 00:00:00+00:00,How Will AMD's New AI Chip Impact Nvidia's (NVDA) Stock?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-will-amds-new-ai-chip-impact-nvidias-nvda-stock,"T
his morning, financial news channels are all giving extensive coverage to the event held yesterday by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to present their new MI300X microchip. The standard take is that it will take a lot of business away from Nvidia (NVDA), whose status as the lone supplier of chips suitable for developing AI platforms has been responsible for that stock posting gains of well over 200% this year. So, is the news good or bad for AMD, good or bad for NVDA, or some combination of those things?
Maybe it is just the arrogance of someone who has worked in and around financial markets for forty years or so, but I believe that if you want an answer as to how any news or development is going to impact a company, the best thing to do is to look at how its stock performs once the information becomes public. On that basis, AMD getting into the rapidly expanding market for AI capable chips isn’t necessarily bad news for NVDA. The development of the MI300X was first announced back in June. Since then, NVDA has continued to show gains.
The above chart shows the performance of NVDA (blue line) and AMD (green line) over the last six months. As you can see, the announcement that AMD was developing a chip to compete with Nvidia has not really held back NVDA, which has gained over 20% over the period, nor has it really helped AMD, which has been basically flat. One assumes that that is a result of skepticism from traders and investors about whether AMD’s offering would prove to be a real competitor to NVDA. Maybe, given the difficulty of developing and manufacturing these chips, there was even some doubt that AMD would actually be able to make something that was a serious competitor.
What we learned yesterday is that the development program has been a success, and that AMD believes that they have a decent product. That view was supported by the news that some big customers, such as Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) have said that they would be open to using the MI300X. So, can we expect AMD to make rapid gains from here at the expense of NVDA?
That would definitely be the case if this were a zero sum game, but it isn’t. The market for AI capable chips is expanding so rapidly that there was never going to be only one manufacturer for any length of time. During the event the AMD CEO, Lisa Su, forecast that that market would reach in excess of $400 billion by 2027. If she is correct, competition for Nvidia was not just inevitable, but is actually necessary if demand is to be met.
The market knows this, of course, and has factored it into the current pricing of NVDA. Even if we assume that Su’s forecast is off by $100 billion, that still leaves a market of $300 billion in four years, and Nvidia’s revenue for fiscal year 2023 was just under $27 billion. That means even if the MI300X is wildly successful and grabs half the market, Nvidia’s revenue will still grow by around $123 billion by 2027. Using a more conservative number than the AMD CEO, there appears to still be plenty of upside for NVDA, that is currently trading at a forward P/E of 41.6 based on analysts’ estimates for 2024, and 25.1 for 2025.
AMD’s forward P/Es, at 60.8 and 40.4 for those years look a bit less attractive, but if the new generation of chips is even moderately successful, their revenue, which is currently roughly equal to NVDA’s, is about to enter a period of rapid growth, so the forecasts on which those numbers are based will prove to be underestimates and that stock, too, will have a big upside.
As I write on Thursday morning, it seems that traders agree with the view that the most important thing about yesterday’s event was Su’s bullish estimate of the growth in the market for AI capable chips, growth which leaves room for both AMD and NVDA to post further gains. You might think that what looks like a successful launch of a competitor’s product would hurt NVDA, but both stocks are up in early trading. That tells investors who trust the market to get it right most of the time all they need to know.

The explosive rally seen in November shows signs of faltering. As of this writing, the major stock indices have declined for three consecutive days at the start of December and there is no sign of a year-end Santa Claus rally.
Could investors end up with a lump of coal in their stockings this year? It’s still early in the final month of the year, but a surge in the market this December is by no means guaranteed. So what are investors to do amid continued uncertainty?
One of the best options is to put capital into stocks of reliable blue-chip companies. This idea looks particularly good as the Dow Jones Industrial Average that is comprised of 30 large blue-chip stocks is outperforming right now, having posted its best monthly gain in November since October 2022. Here are three blue-chip stocks you can count on for stability.
McDonald’s (MCD)

Fast food giant McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is typically a safe bet. The burger chain’s stock is up nearly 10% this year and has gained more than 55% in the last five years. And the company has just announced a major expansion initiative, with plans to open 9,000 new restaurant locations and add 100 million members to its loyalty rewards program by 2027. The aggressive growth targets are part of the Chicago-based company’s plans to grow its worldwide sales and bolster its stock price.
For 2024, McDonald’s is projecting net new restaurant growth of 4%. After next year, the company plans to grow its restaurant count by about 5% annually. Company executives said that by 2027 they want to have 50,000 restaurant locations worldwide, up from 41,198 restaurants currently. The company also plans to boost its loyalty rewards program that helps to drive mobile sales and repeat business. MCD stock also pays a healthy quarterly dividend of $1.67 per share for a yield of 2.33%.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Speaking of growth, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has just introduced a new series of microchips called the “Ryzen 8040” that are aimed at boosting artificial intelligence (AI) applications by up to 60%. AMD announced that its new chips will be incorporated into most laptops and personal computers starting in the first quarter of 2024. The new chips are expected to be a major catalyst to AMD’s revenue and its stock price.
AMD also announced that its highly anticipated MI300X accelerator microchip is now available for sale. That chip is used in data centers and servers and directly competes against rival Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) high-powered AI data center chips. AMD said that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have already placed large orders for the MI300X chip, which they plan to use in their own AI models.
During its most recentearnings call AMD executives said that they expect data center microchips to generate $2 billion of sales for the company in 2024. AMD’s stock has gained 83% in 2023.
Toll Brothers (TOL)

Despite some difficulties in the housing market brought about by high interest rates, the stocks of home builders are proving to be good investment as we close out 2023 and look to 2024. Case in point is Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), whose stock has risen 75% this year, including a 3% boost after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts. Through five years, TOL stock is up 168%. The stock also pays a quarterly dividend of 21 cents for a 0.94% yield.
Toll Brothers reported earnings per share (EPS) of $4.11 on revenue of $3 billion for its fiscal Q4. For the full year, the company announced earnings of $12.36 a share on $10 billion in sales. Both the quarterly and full-year results beat analysts’ consensus expectations. Looking head, Toll Brothers expects to do even better, noting that a decline in interest rates in 2024 should bolster the spring selling season across the U.S. housing market. It plans to deliver more than 10,000 homes over the next 12 months.

2023-12-11 00:00:00+00:00,NVIDIA (NVDA) Taps Southeast Asia Amid China Sales Restriction,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-nvda-taps-southeast-asia-amid-china-sales-restriction,"NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is focusing on deepening its business relationship with Southeast Asian nations amid growing tensions between the United States and China, as evident from some recent events. Over the past week, the co-founder and CEO of the U.S.-based semiconductor company, Jensen Huang, has visited three Southeast Asian countries, namely Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam.
During his visit to these nations, Huang stated that Southeast Asia could be a very important technology location. Considering the region’s expertise in packaging, assembling and battery manufacturing, he believes that it can play a major role in the semiconductor supply chain.
NVIDIA signed an artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure deal with the Malaysian conglomerate YTL’s subsidiary, YTL Power International, during his trip to Malaysia. Per the agreement, the two companies will work together on building AI capabilities at YTL’s data center complex in Kulai, Johor. The first phase of the project is anticipated to be operational starting mid-2024. The deal is expected to be worth $4.3 billion.
In Vietnam, NVIDIA’s CEO has shown interest in deepening business ties with Vietnamese top tech firms and is also looking forward to setting a second base for the company in the country. Huang also intends to support Vietnam in training the workforce to develop AI and digital infrastructure.
The company has already invested $250 million in Vietnam through partnering with the country’s top tech companies. These collaborations focus on deploying AI across multiple industries, including cloud services, healthcare and automotive.
NVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus

NVIDIA Looks Toward Diversifying Its Market Presence
The U.S. chipmaker has been caught in the crossfire of the U.S.-China tech war. Over the past year, the U.S. government has restricted NVIDIA from selling its several advanced AI chips to China in a bid to restrict the country from getting hands-on cutting-edge technologies that can strengthen its military.
NVIDIA had earlier stated that it may be forced to discontinue its business operations from countries on the U.S. government’s export restriction list. The rules are expected to impact NVDA’s ability to support its existing customers and complete the development of certain products in a timely manner. In third-quarter fiscal 2024, the company had generated 22% of its total revenues from China (including Hong Kong).
Considering the growing risk of doing business in China amid the tech war, the company is looking to expand its market presence. In this regard, the latest investments in Southeast Asian nations could be seen as its long-term strategic move to diversify its supply chain as well as market presence.
In third-quarter fiscal 2024, Singapore, a Southeast Asian nation, generated $2.7 billion in revenues, contributing approximately 15% to NVIDIA’s total sales in the quarter. This marked a robust five-fold year-over-year growth, mainly driven by surging AI investments across the data center end-market.
We believe that NVIDIA, with its latest investments, is seems to looking for such growth from other Southeast Asian countries.
Investment in GenAI to Drive Growth
NVIDIA dominates the market for AI chips. The meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and its adoption among enterprises have already proven generative AI technology’s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development. The growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications.
However, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.
NVIDIA’s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises. The company’s GPUs are already being applied in AI models. This is expanding NVDA’s footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.
The generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. Considering surging AI investments across the data center end-market, NVIDIA expects its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to reach $20 billion from $6.05 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Shares of NVDA have surged 219% year to date (YTD).

2023-12-12 00:00:00+00:00,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Crushed Wall Street in 2023, but This Stock Could Continue the Party in 2024",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-magnificent-seven-stocks-crushed-wall-street-in-2023-but-this-stock-could-continue-the,"The ""Magnificent Seven,"" a select group of the world's largest technology companies, has been the story of Wall Street this year. These stocks have seen gains of between 50% and 219% since in 2023.
Such gains aren't typical for stocks, especially those that are already among the largest market cap companies on the planet. It's fair to wonder whether the party will end in 2024.
Unfortunately, these types of gains probably won't go on forever. However, there could be one exception, one of the ""Magnificent Seven"" that's just getting started.
A year for the ages
If you're unfamiliar with the Magnificent Seven, they are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). They are not only leaders in their fields but have massive revenue and profits, are trusted brands, and have the attention of investors and consumers.
It's been a great year if you've been holding these stocks. The most popular stocks don't always perform well, but 2023 was an extraordinary year.
AAPL data by YCharts.
Investors must always put things in context, and this is no exception. While these stocks have gone to the metaphorical moon, their valuations have mostly followed. Their forward price-to-earnings ratios have risen by as much as 160%, except for one.
AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.
Chip company Nvidia's forward earnings valuation actually fell despite its massive share price growth this year. That's because Nvidia is at the front of a generational growth opportunity, similar to what the internet or cloud technology did for the modern economy.
A $2 trillion industry in the making
Nvidia emerged as a force in artificial intelligence (AI). AI models require a ton of computing power to process immense amounts of data quickly. The hardware that provides that power is what allows users to type complex questions into large language models like ChatGPT and get detailed answers in seconds. Nvidia specializes in chips designed for these high-compute workloads.
Analysts estimate that it has a market share of between 70% and 95% in that slice of the chip market, dominating an industry with billions of dollars of investment pouring in. That shows up in Nvidia's financials, too, where its revenue growth has taken off in 2023.
NVDA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts.
This could only be the beginning. Lisa Su, CEO of rival Advanced Micro Devices, has predicted the AI chip market will balloon to over $400 billion in the coming years. Researchers at Statista believe the global AI market opportunity will be worth as much as $2 trillion by 2030.
Even if AMD and other competitors chip away at Nvidia's market share, the growth of the pie could offset a lot of what they take from it. Remember, Nvidia's companywide revenue is at $45 billion today. A $400 billion chip market that Nvidia dominates should translate to years of revenue growth.
Somehow, Nvidia stock is still affordable
If these predictions are remotely accurate, you can make the case that Nvidia is still cheap today. Analysts believe Nvidia's earnings per share will come in at around $12.29 for the year. That gives it a price-to-earnings ratio of 38.
Growth expectations rocketed higher as Nvidia's growth accelerated and showed the impact AI could have on its business.
NVDA EPS LT Growth Estimates data by YCharts.
For a business growing earnings at 39%, a price-to-earnings ratio of 38 is a fine valuation. There are risks, in that Nvidia must live up to these high expectations. The stock has also risen by more than 200% since January, and any stock on that kind of a tear can cool off, so investors should expect some volatility.
But when all is said and done, AI would have to be a complete fluke for the long-term trend to point anywhere but up. Nvidia controls most of the market's AI chips, the building blocks of this new technology. That's a great driver's seat for the company and an opportunity for investors to ride Nvidia higher.

2023-12-14 00:00:00+00:00,"Up 230%, 3 Reasons Nvidia Stock Can Still Make You Richer",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/up-230-3-reasons-nvidia-stock-can-still-make-you-richer,"Perhaps no company epitomizes 2023's artificial intelligence (AI) boom more than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Shares of the tech giant soared a whopping 230% as investors piled in based on optimism that rising demand for its advanced chips would boost revenue and earnings. Let's discuss three reasons why the meteoric rise looks far from over.
1. Nvidia's operating results are incredible
Founded in 1993, Nvidia is known for pioneering the graphics processing unit (GPU), a computer chip originally designed to render complex visuals and animations mainly for the video game industry. GPUs work through parallel processing, which involves computing multiple tasks simultaneously. This turned out to have massive applications in non-graphics-related tasks like generative AI because it helps train large language models (LLMs) on vast amounts of data.
Nvidia's early focus on video game hardware gave it a massive head start in what is shaping up to be a much greater long-term opportunity. And the company's results demonstrate this epic transformation.
Nvidia's third-quarter revenue jumped 206% year over year to $18.12 billion based on sales of its new AI-capable GPUs for enterprise clients (data centers). The data center segment now represents 80% of company sales, eclipsing the previously core gaming segment, which is now under 16% of its top line. AI chips are expensive, with Nvidia's flagship H100 retailing for $30,000. And this can mean better margins and more profits -- especially since demand currently outstrips supply.
Nvidia's third-quarter net income soared by over 1,000% to $9.24 billion, and the company boasts a net income margin of 51%, which is pretty impressive for a company that manufactures and sells physical products.
2. The AI market is big enough for competition
Rapid growth and abnormal profits attract competition like moths to a flame, and Nvidia's GPU business is no exception. The biggest threat may come from its oldest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, which is currently scaling up production of its M1300x family of chips, designed to rival Nvidia's H100 in AI model training and inference, which involves running the applications in real time after they have been trained.

But while Nvidia will no longer be the only game in town, that doesn't mean it has lost its economic moat. While AMD's chips are said to match Nvidia's performance, they are far behind in hitting the market, with sales expected to scale up in 2024. By the time the M1300x becomes widely available, Nvidia has plenty of time to release even more advanced chips, maintaining the bleeding edge and the pricing power that comes with it.
With the AI chip market expected to reach $400 billion by 2027, there is plenty of room for both companies to share the massive opportunity.
3. Nvidia's valuation is still reasonable
After its meteoric rise in 2023, Nvidia's share price looks quite expensive on the surface. Its price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 26 is 10 times higher than the S&P 500 average of 2.6. But that metric doesn't account for Nvidia's rapid growth rate or spectacular margins.
With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 24, Nvidia's stock is still relatively cheap compared to projected future profits. And that means investors still aren't too late to bet on its long-term AI potential.

2023-12-15 00:00:00+00:00,"Can Nvidia Stock Hit $1,000 in 2024?",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-nvidia-stock-hit-%241000-in-2024,"Leading accelerated computing player Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has emerged as a Wall Street darling amid the artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy of 2023. The launch of OpenAI's famous chatbot ChatGPT also highlighted the role of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) in training and deploying large language models (LLMs), which drive generative AI applications like ChatGPT. Subsequently, many enterprises started increasingly adopting generative AI technologies, further spurring demand for the company's AI chips. This has been a catalyst for Nvidia in 2023.
Nvidia's share price is up by nearly 219% this year, thanks to its position as a leading GPU provider in the ongoing AI revolution. Can the company continue this pace of share price growth and reach $1,000 per share in 2024? Let's find out.
Impressive financial performance
Nvidia has posted stellar financial performance in its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ending Oct. 29, 2023), with revenues soaring by 206% year over year to $18.1 billion and net income surging by 1,259% year over year to $9.2 billion.
The data center segment (which accounted for almost 80% of Nvidia's total revenues) saw revenues jump year over year by 279% to $14.5 billion. Additionally, while the company's gaming segment was grappling with an excessive inventory buildup of GPUs in the past year, it is now showing signs of recovery in line with the overall PC market. In the third quarter, the company's gaming business reported revenues of $2.86 billion, up 81% year over year.
Multiple AI-driven opportunities
Unsurprisingly, the data center business is the biggest near-term opportunity for Nvidia. CEO Jensen Huang expects data centers to spend nearly $1 trillion in the next four years on upgrading general computing to accelerated computing infrastructure -- thereby equipping themselves to handle complex AI workloads. With Nvidia accounting for nearly 91.4% of the enterprise GPU market (in 2021), the company's cutting-edge AI chips (H100 and upcoming H200) are well positioned to leverage this opportunity.
Furthermore, the demand for Nvidia's proprietary InfiniBand networking technology has grown fivefold year over year in the third quarter, to enhance scale and performance while training LLMs. At the end of the third quarter, Nvidia has already crossed the $10 billion annualized run rate for its networking solutions.
Rather than focusing only on hardware, Nvidia has also made significant strides in its software strategy. The company expects its software, support, and services offerings to rake in around $1 billion in annual revenues in fiscal 2024. Nvidia expects its DGX Cloud service and AI enterprise software to be used extensively to train and deploy LLMs.
Nvidia's software-hardware ecosystem has helped it build a highly sticky customer base.
High valuation may be a deterrent
As of this writing, Nvidia is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 25.9, far more than the median semiconductor industry valuation of 2.9. A few analysts also think that the company deserves this premium valuation based on its prowess in accelerated computing, market-leading AI-focused data center offerings, and stellar financial numbers.
However, some risks should not be ignored. The recent U.S. restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips to China are a significant challenge for the company. With several small chip players chasing Nvidia's nearly 90% share in the $7 billion Chinese chip market, the company's top line may take a hit in the coming quarters.
Nvidia's P/S ratio has also increased in tandem with the share price in 2023. Therefore, with the current valuation assuming near-perfect execution for the company, chances of future multiple expansion amid the current difficult geopolitical environment appear slim.
So let's assume that the average P/S ratio reverts to Nvidia's five-year average multiple of 22.58 (which is still quite high) in 2024. Analysts expect Nvidia's revenues to be nearly $90 billion in fiscal 2025 (ending Jan. 31, 2025). Multiplying these numbers gives us an estimate of Nvidia's market capitalization of $2 trillion in 2024 -- less than double the company's current market capitalization of $1.15 trillion. Assuming that the share count remains constant, we can expect Nvidia's share price to reach around $820 in the best scenarios.
Hence, even with highly optimistic back-of-napkin calculations, Nvidia does not seem to reach $1,000 per share in 2024. But that doesn't mean that there is no growth potential in this stock. A bullish price target of over $800 is also impressive -- suggesting an upside of more than 71% in the next 12 months.
As such, it makes sense for retail investors to consider buying a small stake in the stock, even at elevated levels.
