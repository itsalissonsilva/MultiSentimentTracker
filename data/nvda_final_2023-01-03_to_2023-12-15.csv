2023-01-03 00:00:00+00:00,Should You Follow Warren Buffett's Lead and Buy This Stock?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-follow-warren-buffetts-lead-and-buy-this-stock,"In Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) latest 13F filing (a disclosure all firms must file if their holdings total more than $100 million), a new position in Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) was revealed. With a total investment worth over $4 billion, it's the 10th largest Berkshire position and makes up about 1.4% of its total portfolio.
That's a significant investment for Warren Buffett and the company, so they are clearly excited about something. Additionally, the stock is currently trading around the lowest price it experienced in Q3, so investors can get in at the same or even lower price than Buffett did.
So should investors follow Buffett's lead? Or are there better stocks out there?
Taiwan Semiconductor presents a significant risk investors must understand
By revenue, Taiwan Semiconductor is the largest semiconductor company worldwide. However, it's not a company you or I can purchase directly from -- it supplies chips to large customers.
Apple, Nvidia, and AMD are all clients of Taiwan Semiconductor, which spreads out the risk of one company changing suppliers or going under. However, it's widely known that Apple is Taiwan Semiconductor's largest customer, making up around one-quarter of revenue, while the next closest is around 5%. This might concern some investors, but it doesn't worry Buffett because he is a significant holder of both Apple (his largest holding) and Taiwan Semiconductor (Berkshire owns 1.2% of the company).
As Apple attempts to source more products domestically, Taiwan Semiconductor is answering the call. By investing $40 billion to build two new chip manufacturing plants in Arizona, Taiwan Semiconductor is making one of the largest foreign investments in U.S. history. Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed Apple would source the chips from these plants, so investors shouldn't be worried about losing Apple's business.
However, one thing investors are worried about (and will likely never be resolved) is its location. China-Taiwan relations are incredibly complex, and many worry about a complete Chinese takeover someday. This would be a massive problem for the company, and the stock would negatively react if an invasion occurred. Again, I don't know if this will ever happen, but it is an investment risk you must understand before taking a position.
That's a major red flag for many investors, but its finances may warrant taking a position regardless.
Revenue growth won't be as good as it has been
In Q3, revenue rose 48% year over year, while net income was up 80%. Furthermore, its profit margin came in at 46%, making it among the world's most profitable companies.
However, the good times aren't projected to last, with the semiconductor shortage easing and spending by the U.S. consumer potentially weakening. The average analyst projects just 2.8% revenue growth in 2023, with earnings per share (EPS) decreasing from $6.45 to $5.96.
Still, the stock trades at an attractive 12.3 times forward earnings when this slowdown is factored in. Compared to its historical trailing price-to-earnings ratio, that's a good price to pay for the stock.
TSM PE Ratio data by YCharts
Once the U.S. economy regains its strength, Taiwan Semiconductor will likely see a surge of demand from Apple and its other clients, which is reflected in analysts' $6.45 EPS 2024 projection.
So should you follow Buffett and buy this stock? I'd say it depends on your risk tolerance. If you're worried about Chinese aggression or a key customer like Apple leaving, you'll want to steer far away from the stock. However, if you're not as worried about either of those actions happening, now seems like a great time to establish a position with its relatively low valuation.
As a side benefit, Taiwan Semiconductor pays a generous 2.5% dividend yield, although the yield will fluctuate due to currency exchange issues. (Taiwan Semiconductor pays its dividend in New Taiwan dollars.)
As with any investment, keeping your exposure to the stock relevant to its risks is essential. I think a smaller position size is warranted, with Taiwan Semiconductor having one major risk that could wreck the company. Nevertheless, I think Buffett and Berkshire likely found a winner in Taiwan Semiconductor, and investors shouldn't be afraid to follow them.

NVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus
  NVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote
NVIDIA’s foray into the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space is a positive. It is working with more than 320 automakers, tier-one suppliers, automotive research institutions, high-definition mapping companies, and start-ups to develop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. The company expects its automotive total addressable market to be $30 billion by 2025, which comprises $25 billion for driving, $3 billion for training/development of deep neural networks, and $2 billion for validation and testing.
However, weakening demand across its Gaming and Professional Visualization market segments put a brake on its growth momentum in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The company’s third-quarter revenues plunged 17% year over year and 12% sequentially to $5.93 billion. Also, macroeconomic headwinds like persistent supply-chain and logistic issues adversely impacted the company’s ability to meet the demand for chips used in the data center end market in the quarter.

2023-01-05 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Chip Stocks Paying Dividends,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-chip-stocks-paying-dividends,"Semiconductors, commonly called microchips, enable many items we use on a daily basis to work correctly and efficiently. Around the size of a small coin, we find them within our mobile devices, vehicles, computers, and freezers, to name a few.
As we wade deeper into a more technological world, the demand for chips has exploded, causing many semiconductor-related stocks to gain widespread attention.
Namely, two of the most popular chip stocks have been none other than Advanced Micro Devices AMD and NVIDIA NVDA.
Still, in 2022, many semiconductor stocks got beaten down, ending their fantastic runs.
However, several semiconductor stocks have seen their earnings outlook drift higher over the last several months, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM, STMicroelectronics STM, and Power Integrations POWI.
Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three stocks over the last year, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Let’s take a closer look at each one.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world’s largest circuit foundry, responsible for supplying chips to tech titans such as Qualcomm QCOM and Apple AAPL. Currently, the company sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
TSM has generated solid free cash flow as of late, reported at roughly $4.6 billion in its latest quarter and reflecting a 16% sequential uptick. As we can see in the chart below, the company’s free cash flow has recovered nicely from 2021 lows.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
For those seeking income, TSM has that covered; the company’s annual dividend currently yields approximately 1.9%. Further, the company has been committed to increasingly rewarding its shareholders, growing its payout by more than 10% over the last five years.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
STMicroelectronics
STMicroelectronics designs, develops, manufactures, and markets a broad range of semiconductor integrated circuits and discrete devices used in microelectronic applications. Currently, STM boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
STM is no stranger to exceeding quarterly estimates, exceeding top and bottom line expectations in four consecutive quarters. Additionally, it’s worth highlighting that all its last four EPS beats have been by at least 11%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
STM pays a small dividend, currently yielding a modest 0.5% and below its Zacks Computer and Technology sector average. The company pays out just 6% of its earnings.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Power Integrations Inc.
Power Integrations is a supplier of high-performance electronic components used in high-voltage power-conversion systems. POWI sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
The company rewards its shareholders via its annual dividend that currently yields 1%, nearly precisely in line with its Zacks Computer and Technology sector average.
Impressively, POWI has upped its dividend payout eight times over the last five years, translating to a 22% five-year annualized growth rate.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
And for the cherry on top, POWI shares have been consistently strong, up a solid 90% over the last five years and widely outperforming relative to the S&P 500.

Bottom Line
While it’s been a rough past year to own chip stocks, the near-term outlook for all three stocks above – Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM, STMicroelectronics STM, and Power Integrations POWI – have drifted higher, undoubtedly a positive development.
In addition, valuations have been slashed across nearly all chip stocks, indicating that the worst could be in the rearview mirror.

2023-01-06 00:00:00+00:00,5 Top Growth Stocks to Buy Right Now That Could Soar in 2023,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-top-growth-stocks-to-buy-right-now-that-could-soar-in-2023,"Well-chosen growth stocks can create fortunes for their shareholders. The key is to identify huge and rapidly expanding industries -- and the businesses that are competing and winning within them.
The following companies are primed to capture bigger portions of massive growth markets. Investors who buy their shares today are likely to be well rewarded.
The Trade Desk
Advertising dollars follow eyeballs. And with more eyes viewing online content every year, ad spending is migrating from legacy media to digital channels.
The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) provides a platform for marketers to buy and manage their digital ad campaigns across a variety of online media. Its transparent pricing and advanced analytics are helping it rapidly gain share in the massive, $800 billion global advertising market.
The connected-TV segment of the ad market is expanding at a particularly brisk pace. Partnerships with the likes of Walt Disney enable The Trade Desk to offer its customers the opportunity to place their ads on popular streaming services, including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+.
These factors have allowed The Trade Desk to grow quickly since its initial public offering (IPO), with its revenue expanding from $203 million in 2016 to nearly $1.5 billion over the trailing 12 months. And with the digital ad industry projected to surpass $1 trillion by 2027, according to Statista, this adtech star has a long runway for growth still ahead.
Microsoft
In the world of technology, few businesses are as diversified as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The tech titan commands a leading share of several enormous markets, such as commuter operating systems, productivity solutions, cloud computing, and gaming.
These varied revenue streams allow Microsoft to survive and even thrive during nearly all manner of market environments, thereby reducing the risks for investors. They also enable the software colossus to profit from the rising adoption of a wide range of new technologies. In 2023 and the years that follow, much of this growth will take place in the cloud.
Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform is growing rapidly within a market that's projected to exceed $1.5 trillion in annual revenue by 2030, up from $484 billion in 2022, according to Grand View Research. The company's booming cloud profits should drive strong returns for shareholders in the coming years.
Snowflake
As more companies shift their operations to the cloud, data -- and the ability to harvest actionable insights from it -- is becoming only more valuable. Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) helps organizations aggregate and analyze information from a wide range of otherwise siloed sources. The data warehousing platform, in turn, is quickly becoming an indispensable technology partner for businesses of all sizes.
Strong customer gains, combined with higher sales to existing clients, are fueling Snowflake's growth. The cloud data specialist's revenue soared 67% year over year to $557 million in the quarter ended Oct. 31.
Management sees much more growth ahead. The company projects that its total market opportunity will expand to a staggering $248 billion by 2026, leaving plenty of room for further gains.
Nvidia
Cloud computing is just one of the powerful trends fueling sales of high-performance semiconductors. Robotics, autonomous vehicles, augmented and virtual reality, and an array of other emerging markets are also boosting demand for high-tech chips. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) makes some of the best chips on the market -- and it's poised to benefit from these trends more than perhaps any other company.
All told, the semiconductor leader estimates its long-term addressable market at $1 trillion. Despite its already impressive $28 billion in annual revenue, an opportunity that large leaves space for tremendous growth, even for a giant like Nvidia.
In the near term, the rumored launch of a new Switch console by Nintendo could provide a significant boost to Nvidia's gaming business in 2023.
PayPal
By eliminating the need to enter your credit card information every time you make a purchase, PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) makes it easier, faster, and more secure to shop online. These benefits have made PayPal a favorite payment option for shoppers. Merchants also love it because PayPal tends to boost their sales conversion rates and, by extension, profits.
After rising sharply during the early stages of the pandemic, e-commerce sales have slowed as more people have returned to brick-and-mortar stores. But online retail sales will grow to nearly $7.4 trillion by 2025, up from $5.5 trillion in 2022, according to eMarketer. As a leading digital-payments platform, PayPal is well-positioned to profit from this global megatrend.
Moreover, a partnership with Apple will bring the iPhone's popular tap-to-pay functionality to PayPal's U.S.-based users in 2023. This growth catalyst, combined with PayPal's cost-cutting initiatives, could help to drive the payment-leader's profits sharply higher in the year ahead.

2023-01-10 00:00:00+00:00,The Top 5 Stocks Bought by Congress in 2022,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-top-5-stocks-bought-by-congress-in-2022,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Although controversial and viewed by some as a conflict of interest, members of Congress continue to actively trade stocks. And the latest data on those trades reveals that many elected representatives managed to outperform the market in 2022. While 2022 saw all the major indices in the U.S. suffer their worst downturn since the 2008 financial crisis, many members of Congress earned strong gains last year.
Data released by the website Unusual Whales shows that Representative Patrick Fallon (R-Texas), for example, earned 51.6% on his investments in 2022, while Representative Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-Florida) saw a gain of 50.8%. Other members of Congress posted gains of 10% or greater as the benchmark S&P 500 index declined 19% on the year, and the technology-laden Nasdaq fell 33%.
Some members of Congress are extremely active when it comes to buying and selling stocks. Representative Michael McCaul (R-Texas) made more than 1,600 transactions worth as much as $176 million in 2022.
So what’s the secret? Which stocks do members of Congress hold in their personal portfolios? Here is a list of the top five stocks purchased by Congress in 2022.
Ticker Company Price
NVDA Nvidia $156.28
GOOG, GOOGL Alphabet $88.80, $88.02
TSLA Tesla $119.77
DIS Disney $94.77
AAPL Apple $130.15
Top Stocks Held by Congress in 2022: Nvidia (NVDA)

Members of Congress seemed committed to the principle of buying low as they purchased $5.6 million worth of shares in semiconductor and microchip company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the stock declined 46% over the past year. Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia, whose chips are used in everything from electric vehicles to supercomputers, was a darling of the Covid-19 pandemic.
However, NVDA stock led the semiconductor sector lower in 2022 as concerns mounted about slowing demand for semiconductors and microchips, particularly in personal computers, and as supply chain issues hurt production. But elected representatives continue to have faith in Nvidia despite the downturn, judging by the fact that it was the fifth most purchased stock among members of Congress in 2022.
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)

Another tech name that members of Congress gravitated to in 2022 was Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL), the parent company of the search engine Google. The Unusual Whales report shows that federal lawmakers bought $5.7 million worth of Alphabet stock last year as it fell to its most affordable level since its 2004 initial public offering (IPO).
A weakening market for online advertising led to mixed financial results from Alphabet and shook confidence in the company and its stock. As a result, shares of GOOGL have sunk 36% in the past 12 months, dragging the price down to nearly $85. Additionally, Alphabet split its stock on a 20-for-1 basis last summer, which helped to dramatically lower the price. At the start of 2022, GOOGL stock had been trading at more than $2,000 per share.
Congress appears to have taken advantage of both the stock split and price decline and bought Alphabet stock with a vengeance in 2022.
Top Stocks Held by Congress in 2022: Tesla (TSLA)
Source: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com
This might be a decision many members of Congress regret. In 2022, elected officials bought $6 million worth of shares in electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). For the first 11 months of last year, that probably seemed like a smart move. However, in December 2022, TSLA stock fell more than 30%. The stock is now down nearly 70% over the last year and trading at $113 a share.
Sentiment towards TSLA stock appears to be getting worse by the day. Analysts and investors are worried about rising competition in the electric vehicle space and that the competitive advantage Tesla has enjoyed for more than a decade is evaporating. Those concerns seemed to be justified by the fact that Tesla continues to miss its delivery targets and is offering steep discounts on its electric vehicles in markets around the world, notably in China.
Still, Tesla proved to be one of the most popular investments among members of Congress in 2022.
Walt Disney Co. (DIS)

It had arguably its worst year ever in 2022, but that didn’t stop members of Congress from purchasing $6.2 million worth of shares in the Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in 2022. Disney began last year dealing with continued Covid-19 outbreaks that forced its theme parks to operate at reduced capacity and ended 2022 with chief executive officer (CEO) Bob Chapek being ousted and former head honcho Robert Iger returning to lead the Mouse House.
In between, the company had to deal with slowing subscriber growth at its Disney+ streaming service and political controversy in Florida, where its main theme park is based. All the issues contributed to a 40% drop in DIS stock over the last 12 months. However, members of Congress seemed unfazed by the issues impacting the company and were content to buy the dip in Disney stock. The return of Robert Iger at the end of last year has brightened the outlook for Disney, and the stock appears to be responding, gaining 10% during the first trading week of 2023.
Apple (AAPL)

Tied with Disney as the most purchased stock by members of Congress in 2022 is consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Elected representatives bought $6.2 million worth of AAPL stock in 2022, according to Unusual Whales. Apple’s share price is down 25% in the last year, including a nearly 10% drop in December 2022.
While many people, including politicians in Washington, D.C., remain bullish on AAPL stock, the company’s share price has suffered over worries of slowing demand for its iPhone, smartwatch, and Mac computer. Apple has also endured some significant production issues in China as Covid-19 lockdowns disrupted one of its largest manufacturing plants and led to clashes between workers and police.
Much was made of Apple’s market capitalization falling below $2 trillion to start 2023. However, members of Congress seem to retain faith in Apple’s stock, buying the shares heavily on the way down.

2023-01-11 00:00:00+00:00,Buy Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Stock Before Key Q4 Earnings?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-taiwan-semiconductor-tsm-stock-before-key-q4-earnings,"Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, one of the major chipmakers and the world’s largest integrated circuit foundry, is set to report its fiscal Q4 earnings on January 12. The report will offer a preview of how semiconductor companies are currently doing as we move further into 2023.
Semiconductor stocks, in general, have felt the brunt of the pain from higher inflation and Taiwan Semiconductor’s report will receive considerable attention with other chip giants like Nvidia NVDA and Broadcom AVGO not reporting until later in the quarter.
Q4 Earnings & Outlook  
With Taiwan Semiconductor sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment it may be more plausible that an earnings beat is in store which could be a further catalyst for broader semiconductor stocks as well.  
The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) has TSM beating expectations by 1.3% as earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher over the last week going into its Q4 report.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus for TSM’s Q4 Earnings is $1.80 per share, which would be a 56% increase year over year. Sales for Q4 are expected to be up 29% at $20.29 billion. This is an indication that Taiwan Semiconductor is starting to adjust to tougher operating environments seen across the global economy.
Taiwan Semiconductor’s full-year earnings for its current fiscal 2022 are projected to climb 55% to $6.39 per share. Fiscal 2023 earnings are forecasted to decline -9% after a better-than-expected year. Earnings estimate revisions are up for FY22 and have started to trend higher again for FY23.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
On the top line, sales for fiscal 2022 are expected to climb 27% and rise another 7% in FY23 to $77.31 billion. Fiscal 2023 would be a very impressive 116% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $35.77 billion.

Performance & Momentum
Over the last year, TSM is still down -38% underperforming the Nasdaq’s -29% and the S&P 500’s -18%. In comparison, Nvidia’s -44% has underperformed TSM and broader indexes as well, while Broadcom’s -8% has outperformed. Taking the last five years into account, we can see from the nearby chart that TSM’s +98% has easily outperformed broader indexes but still trailed the performance of Broadcom and Nvidia.

However, Taiwan Semiconductor stock has continued to see strong momentum of late, rallying nicely over the last two months. TSM stock has now climbed +34% from its November lows, outperforming Broadcom, Nvidia, and the broader indexes during this period.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Valuation
Looking at Taiwan Semiconductor’s valuation may be key for some investors to buy into the possibility of more upside in TSM shares after such extensive rallies.
In this regard, shares of TSM still look attractive trading around $81 per share and at 14.1X forward earnings. This is 59% below its decade high of 34.4X and an 11% discount to the median of 15.9X. Even better, TSM stock trades 18% beneath the benchmark’s 17.5X forward earnings.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Plus, when taking the growth rate into account with its price to earnings TSM’s PEG of 0.66 is nicely below the optimum level of 1. This is also beneath the benchmark’s PEG of 1.64 and the broader Computer and Technology sectors 1.69.
Bottom Line
Based on Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSM) valuation and top line growth there could certainly be more upside in the stock. In addition to sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), TSM stock has an overall “A” VGM Style Scores grade with the average Zacks Price Target suggesting 33% upside from current levels.

2023-01-12 00:00:00+00:00,3 Nvidia Stock Predictions for 2023,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-nvidia-stock-predictions-for-2023,"For years, it seemed Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was unstoppable. In fact, in the decade leading up to November 2021, the company grew its revenue by 645%, which in turn drove its stock up more than 8,000%. Then came the economic storm of supply chain disruptions, high inflation, rising interest rates, and the bear market. As a result, Nvidia shares experienced their worst decline in more than 10 years, plunging 53% from their peak.
Yet based on the available evidence, there are great things to come for the semiconductor specialist. Here are three predictions about what to expect from Nvidia in 2023.
NVIDIA Drive Orin System-on-a-Chip. Image source: Nvidia.
Gaming growth comes roaring back
It's been a tough couple of quarters for Nvidia shareholders and fair-weather investors have been heading for the exits. During the fiscal 2023 third quarter (ended Oct. 30), revenue of $5.9 billion declined 17% year over year, while earnings per share (EPS) of $0.27 plunged 72%.
The culprit? Macroeconomic headwinds have been riding roughshod over consumers. People dealing with decades-high inflation and rising interest rates have become increasingly unsure about what the future holds and are cutting back on spending. Gamers haven't been immune, with many opting to hang on to their high-end Nvidia chips for just a while longer, at least until the economic outlook improves.
History suggests this will result in pent-up demand. As soon as the economy feels a bit more stable, spending on Nvidia processors should kick into high gear, with gamers opting for the latest and greatest the company has to offer.
Many more high-profile partnerships
Nvidia turned heads last week when it announced a strategic partnership with Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry, better known as Foxconn. The company is the world's largest technology manufacturer, best known for assembling Apple's iPhones and other devices. Foxconn and Nvidia will collaborate on highly automated and (eventually) self-driving cars. Foxconn will be the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of electronic control units based on Nvidia's Drive Orin system-on-a-chip (SoC), while also incorporating Nvidia's technology into its own upcoming line of electric vehicles (EVs).
The news came just weeks after Nvidia announced a multiyear collaboration with tech titan Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to build one of the world's most powerful artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputers. The project will feature Nvidia processors, networking, and software combined with Microsoft's Azure Cloud.
These announcements illustrate Nvidia's reputation as the partner to the stars, so expect more high-profile partnerships in the year to come.
The data center segment continues to drive the train
Even as Nvidia's gaming segment has taken on water during the past couple of quarters, the data center business continues to grow at a pace that belies the troubled economy. In the third quarter, data center revenue of $3.83 billion climbed 31% year over year, even as the gaming unit slumped.
The ongoing digital transformation continues to chug along -- even in the midst of economic uncertainty -- driven by the increasing adoption of cloud computing. Nvidia is the go-to and top choice for the biggest names in the cloud. Microsoft's Azure Cloud, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Amazon's AWS all rely on Nvidia GPUs to speed their data around the ether -- as do a host of other top cloud operators.
This suggests Nvidia's data center business will remain the company's principal breadwinner, even after the gaming segment recovers.
Bonus prediction: Nvidia stock rebounds from historic lows
Nvidia has had a tough time this year, but a look back suggests its trouble will be fleeting.
During the 2022 fiscal fourth quarter (ended Jan. 30, 2022), Nvidia reported record quarterly revenue that grew 53% to $7.6 billion. This was the crown jewel of the company's record-setting year, as revenue of $26.9 billion soared 61%.
What drove these stunning overall results? Record quarterly and fiscal-year revenue in each of Nvidia's largest segments: gaming, data center, and professional visualization. Profits were even more impressive, with record EPS of $1.18, which skyrocketed 103%. This illustrates just how robust Nvidia's business was -- before the economic headwinds came to bear. This suggests that when things begin to improve -- as they no doubt will -- Nvidia's recovery will be both swift and strong.
As I mentioned at the onset, Nvidia stock has fallen roughly 53% from its high reached in late 2021. Yet the company continues to steal share, commanding 88% of the discrete desktop GPU market in the third quarter -- its highest level ever.
Furthermore, the company's valuation is low by historical standards, though it still isn't cheap in terms of traditional valuation metrics. Nvidia currently sells for 13 times next year's sales, when a reasonable price-to-sales ratio is generally considered to be between 1 and 2. Still, that's a small price to pay given the company's industry-leading position and history of execution.
I'm not really going out on a limb saying Nvidia's stock price will recover in 2023.

2023-01-13 00:00:00+00:00,The 3 Types of Artificial Intelligence and Top Companies Leading the AI Revolution,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-3-types-of-artificial-intelligence-and-top-companies-leading-the-ai-revolution,"W
hile the great crypto collapse may have garnered most of the headlines towards the end of last year, history will likely mark the biggest news in disruptive tech for 2022 to be OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT in late November. It amassed over 1 million users in just five days right on the heels of its launch of Dall-E in April. In a market that has seen shares plummet, OpenAI has reignited heady valuations.
In this week’s World Reimagined, we will look at the rapidly evolving world of Artificial Intelligence (AI), some of its players, and what companies are poised to gain from a pivotal year where AI hits center stage.
Back in 2018, venture capitalist and computer scientist Kai-Fu Lee told CBS, “I believe [AI] is going to change the world more than anything in the history of mankind. More than electricity.”
For AI to realize its full potential, it needs to be widely available. The launch of ChatGPT, Dall-E and Stable Diffusion in 2022, along with their related applications, make it likely that this is the year Kai-Fu Lee’s prediction becomes real to those outside of AI-focused sectors. 
The 3 Types of AI
AI can be divided into three categories based on capabilities:
Narrow or weak AI is designed to perform a specific task. This application is becoming increasingly common in our daily lives as machine learning and deep learning techniques improve.
General or strong AI is designed to perform any intellectual task that a human can. So far, this has proved highly elusive, but we are getting closer as an international AI race becomes the new global arms race.
Super AI is currently only a hypothetical concept. It is an AI that can perform any task better than a human, is sentient, has emotions and has been used to terrify moviegoers for decades - think Westworld, Blade Runner or Skynet.
Examples of narrow AI include Google’s (GOOG) AlphaGo, IBM’s (IBM) chess-playing supercomputer Deep Blue, Apple’s (AAPL) FaceID unlock, the virtual filters on Snapchat (SNAP) and every writer’s best friend, Grammarly. When I asked ChatGPT if it is a type of narrow AI, this was its response: “Yes, ChatGPT is considered a narrow AI, as it is designed to perform specific tasks and has a limited scope of understanding and capabilities. It is trained on a large dataset of text and can generate human-like responses to text-based prompts, but it does not have the ability to perform a wide range of tasks or understand and process information like a human would.” 
AI Goes Mainstream 
AI is being used across a wide range of industries, such as retail, agriculture, banking, transportation and even by HR departments. Before its public launch, there was already a legion of third-party services and tools being built on top of OpenAI.
For example, on Dec. 12, 2022, Jay Browder, CEO of DoNotPay, tweeted a screen-capture of his company’s AI talking to Comcast’s (CMCSA) AI-driven chatbot to save one of his company’s engineers $120 a year on their internet bill - an AI-to-AI chat that can save you money! The company plans to take on two speeding ticket cases in court next month, using its AI to tell the defendants what to say. 
Other ChatGPT-based applications include QuickVid, which is designed to generate viral YouTube shorts, and MightyGPT, which puts the “superpowers of GPT-3 and ChatGPT” on Meta’s (Meta) WhatsApp and soon on Apple’s (AAPL) iMessage. In October 2022, another OpenAI-based service, Jasper, reached a $1.5 billion valuation just 18 months after it launched, having amassed 100,000 customers, around 75% of whom pay $80 or more monthly for the company’s suite of AI-powered writing templates, striking fear into the hearts of contract writers everywhere. 
OpenAI and its ChatGPT aren’t the only games in town. Anthropic, which was started by former OpenAI employees, has received over $700 million in funding and developed an AI system similar to ChatGPT that reportedly has more “grace” than ChatGPT. Its AI, dubbed Claude, is currently accessible only through a Slack integration as part of a closed beta. The tech was created using a technique called “constitutional AI” that aims to provide a principle-based approach to aligning AI systems with human intentions, which basically means it will be more polite and less offensive in its responses than other models. When you think that these AIs learn from the internet, offensive responses aren’t much of a stretch. The company has indicated that it is looking for a valuation of at least $5 billion in its upcoming $200 million round. Sam Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison and other ex-FTX colleagues collectively invested over $500 million in Anthropic during prior rounds, so their stakes will likely get sold to the highest bidder soon since their assets have been frozen. 
Adept AI Labs is another startup whose founders include former leaders of OpenAI and Google AI. It reportedly recently sought a valuation of around $1 billion following its $250 million valuation during its latest funding round last year. Both Adept and Anthropic are looking for valuations that are hundreds of times their projected topline revenue – heady days are back in parts of the tech sector! 
The release of Stable Diffusion in 2022 was not remarkable only because it was open source, but even more amazing was its diminutive size; AI code tends to be bulky. Upon its release, it was already possible to run it on some consumer graphics cards. In less than a month, it had been optimized to the point where it could be run on an iPhone, leading Apple to announce in December that it had released “optimizations to Core ML for Stable Diffusion in MacOS12.1 and iOS 16.2, along with code to get started deploying in Apple Silicon devices.” What is likely the most interesting aspect of this is the privacy angle because any data entered by an Apple user using this tool will stay on the device. It also means that after downloading it, users won’t need an internet connection, opening up opportunities in areas where connectivity is challenging. 
Innovation is only going to accelerate. According to Senior Partner & Managing Director at Boston Consulting Group and Global Leader of BCG X Sylvain Duranton, “Despite economic headwinds, 60% of BCG’s recently surveyed companies plan to increase their investments in digital and AI in 2023.” According to IDC Research, spending worldwide by governments and businesses on AI technology will top $500 billion in 2023.
Microsoft Gets Serious
The power of ChatGPT lit up social media, with some hypothesizing that it could mean the end of Google’s search dominance. According to Semafor, Microsoft (MSFT) has reportedly been in talks to invest an additional $10 billion in the owner of ChatGPT in a deal that would value OpenAI at $29 billion. The two have been intimately linked since inception. Three years ago, Microsoft invested $1 billion in a project originally co-founded by Elon Musk and Sam Altman, former Y Combinator president, that became known as OpenAI, in an effort to overtake Amazon (AMZN) and Google in their AI efforts. 
ChatGPT’s stunning success means OpenAI needs more of everything, as anyone who has tried to use it can attest. The Microsoft OpenAI deal is a highly unusual structure, according to those claiming to be familiar with the deal. First, OpenAI will pay back its first investors. Then, Microsoft gets 75% of OpenAI’s profits until its principal investment is paid back and 49% of profits after that until it reaches a theoretical cap.
Who’s Winning?
We are still in the early innings of the AI race, but it is already clear that Amazon’s AWS is poised to be a winner as AI requires massive amounts of computing power. For example, the CEO of Stability reported that his company used 256 Nvidia (NVDA) A100s on AWS for 150,000 hours at the cost of $600,000 to train Stable Diffusion. ChatGPT obviously is using Microsoft for computing capacity. Click here to read about chip manufacturers that are poised to benefit in my article last month on Healthcare and AI. 
The next phase of AI could also benefit the social media OG Meta, given its massive amounts of data, which is vital food for machine learning, and the reality that its entire business is based on AI that seeks to target users with increasingly personalized content. Its business is basically all about AI experimentation and iteration. Don’t count this behemoth out just yet and keep a close eye on what is happening with MightyGPT on WhatsApp. 
Alphabet’s Google claims to have image generation AI that outperforms Dall-E and is rumored to have a conversation chat product that is superior to ChatGPT, but so far, it is all just rumor.
We’ve already discussed Microsoft getting even cozier with OpenAI, but what could be yet another major coup for the tech giant is the rumored incorporation of OpenAI’s AI into its Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, and other apps. The Information recently reported that the company’s Bing search plans to use OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology. For those really interested, I suggest you ask ChatGPT itself about how Microsoft could use it, if you can find a time when it isn’t already at capacity.
The Bottom Line 
The internet shrunk the world, allowing us to transact and communicate, regardless of geography. The smartphone placed the whole of human knowledge in the palm of one’s hand and further expanded our ability to communicate, transact and learn. Buckminster Fuller’s “knowledge doubling curve,” pointed out that until 1900, human knowledge doubled approximately every century. By the end of World War II, knowledge was doubling every 25 years. 
Today, on average, human knowledge is estimated to double every 13 months. AI will not just accelerate growth in knowledge but will also give us the ability to use that knowledge in ways that will likely make every other technological advance pale in comparison. From healthcare to energy, construction to the cosmos, we will be able to solve more problems, solve them faster, and solve them more effectively than we could have been dreamed of just a few decades ago.

2023-01-17 00:00:00+00:00,Better Gaming Stock: AMD vs. Nvidia,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-gaming-stock%3A-amd-vs.-nvidia,"While the gaming industry is best known for console manufacturers Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, PC gaming has grown rapidly since the start of the pandemic. PC gaming is all about having the most powerful components, which can provide a more detailed and smoother experience than consoles.
A critical component of PC gaming is a graphic processing unit (GPU), such as the ones from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). The rise of PC gaming has given both companies' stocks triple-digit growth over the last five years.
Declining demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) throughout 2022 coincided with rising inflation and brought down Nvidia and AMD shares between 37% and 48% year over year. However, these companies are unlikely to be down forever, making now an excellent time to invest in one of these tech stars.
Which is the better buy? Let's find out.
Nvidia could see boost on Nintendo console success
The last year has been challenging for Nvidia's stock. The price has dropped nearly 35% in the last 12 months, and at $169, it's close to half the 2021 peak of $329. Despite the price drop, Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is still high at 72.
If it's going to reclaim its losses, the semiconductor designer must keep growing its revenue in a difficult economic environment. That's where its new line-up of GPUs for PC gaming comes in.
Beginning their staggered release in November, Nvidia's RTX 4000 series of GPUs is the company's biggest hardware launch since 2020. The new models replace the RTX 3000 series of cards, which were wildly successful throughout the pandemic and crypto-mining boom.
However, things have gotten off to a rocky start, with Nvidia ""unlaunching"" one of its models following consumer backlash and sales not living up to expectations. It isn't all Nvidia's fault, though -- the GPU market hit a 20-year sales low in the third quarter of 2022.
With the market slump, Nvidia has launched its RTX 4000 series at potentially the worst moment in the last 20 years. The end of crypto mining for Ethereum killed that entire segment for Nvidia, and due to the rising cost of living, gamers aren't showing much appetite to upgrade to the new models.
As a result, there's already talk of Nvidia dropping prices. In 2022, the company misjudged how much consumers were willing to spend by releasing cards at much higher prices than the last generation. The RTX 3080, Nvidia's high-end mainstream GPU, has been replaced by the RTX 4080, with the former launching in 2020 for $699 and the latest version starting at $1,199.
Nvidia has options for adjusting pricing, but if the market drop from Q3 2022 indicates a trend, it will be fighting against the current.
Fortunately, GPUs aren't Nvidia's only source of income from gaming. It also provides the system on a chip (SoC) for the Nintendo Switch. The Switch will be 6 years old in March and is still selling much better than its age would suggest. At 114 million units sold, including over 20 million last year, it's on track to potentially be the best-selling video game console ever.
Nintendo is hard at work on its successor to the Switch, rumored to be again powered by an SoC from Nvidia. The sequel console is expected to be announced in either 2023 or 2024. If the GPU market doesn't pick up, Nvidia will need the Switch successor to be a hit.
AMD enjoys more diverse exposure to gaming
AMD's stock has followed a similar trend as Nvidia's, with its shares down 46% in the last year. The stock is also considerably down from its 2021 peak of $155, now sitting at $71.
Fortunately for AMD, its P/E ratio of 42 is slightly more attractive than Nvidia's. The company also doesn't have as much invested in the success of the GPU market as Nvidia, despite competing with equivalent models.
In Q3 2022, AMD had a 16% market share in the discrete GPU market. Meanwhile, Nvidia had a 72% market share in the same quarter. As a result, a sustained slump in the market would harm Nvidia considerably more than AMD.
Moreover, AMD has its own position in the console market, providing SoCs to Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S consoles. Combined, the new consoles from Sony and Microsoft are outselling the Nintendo Switch, providing AMD a bigger revenue boost from consoles than Nvidia.
AMD also provides processors (CPUs) for the consumer and gaming enthusiast market. Its new Ryzen 7000 series of CPUs are the company's biggest new product in that space since 2017 and the start of a new platform that will be supported until at least 2025.
Overall, AMD is more diversified in the gaming industry than its competitor Nvidia. The company can rely on two huge customers to sell consoles, it has less exposure in the stagnating GPU market, and its new CPU platform gives it another revenue stream from PC gamers. If you're picking one of these gaming stocks to invest in, AMD stock is the way to go.

2023-01-19 00:00:00+00:00,The Top 7 “Millionaire-Maker” Long-Term Stocks for 2023,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-top-7-millionaire-maker-long-term-stocks-for-2023,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Study after study shows that a long-term buy-and-hold investing strategy works best. A long-term investment is generally defined as any position in a stock that is held for a year or longer. While the stock market can decline by 20% or more in a single year, which was the case in 2022, equities almost always rise over the long term. For example, the U.S. stock market has posted an average annual return of 8% or more during 20-year periods. Over 30 years, the average annual return is closer to 9%, for a total return of 1,300%. The math is clear. The longer one stays invested, the better their returns are likely to be.
However, staying invested through market downturns, economic shocks, global recessions, and wars can be difficult. As humans, we are prone to getting nervous and frightened, and that can lead to us hitting the “sell” button too early, costing us dearly in the long run. Remaining calm and being patient are often the most important attributes of an investor. Here are the top seven “millionaire-maker” long-term stocks to buy for 2023.
Ticker Company Price
AAPL Apple $135.21
NVDA Nvidia $173.77
AMZN Amazon $95.46
BRK-A, BRK-B Berkshire Hathaway $466,259.97, $308.30
DXCM Dexcom $106.63
GOOG, GOOGL Alphabet $91.78, $91.12
COST Costco $479.47
Apple (AAPL)

Few stocks have returned as much value to shareholders as consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The Silicon Valley company’s share price has gained 202% in the last five years, 625% in the past decade, and 79,000% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1983. Long-term, it is difficult to find a stock that has performed better than Apple. And the good news for investors is that Apple is currently on sale, having declined 21% over the last 12 months to currently trade at $134 a share.
Many of the world’s most successful investors have made Apple a core position in their portfolio, including Warren Buffett, the most successful investor of all time. Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), currently owns $123.34 billion worth of Apple stock, making it the biggest position in the portfolio. Buffett himself has been buying AAPL stock over the last year as the price has slumped.
With continued new product innovations, including rumors of a touchscreen Mac computer and virtual reality headset, Apple looks set to outperform for many years to come.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been battered and bruised in the last year. The Santa Clara, California-based company’s stock price has fallen 35% over the last 12 months, which is close to the drop in the Nasdaq index over the same time period. However, NVDA stock remains up nearly 200% in the last five years and has gained 5,350% over the last 10 years. As long-term investments go, Nvidia has been a winner for its shareholders.
There is every reason to believe that Nvidia will continue its outperformance. The company’s microchips and semiconductors are at the cutting edge of technological innovations that include artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. And its products continue to dominate in the video game space. With supply chain bottlenecks and demand recovering, there are signs that NVDA stock may have bottomed in recent weeks. So far into 2023, the share price has increased by 18% to now trade at just under $170 a share.
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com
Don’t count out e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) either as a going concern or an investment. The Seattle-based company has produced long-term gains for investors that few other stocks can match. AMZN stock had climbed higher by nearly 600% in the last 10 years and is up nearly 110,000% since its 1997 IPO when it began trading for less than $1 a share. While the share price has been knocked lower by nearly 40% in the last 12 months, indications point to short-term issues that shouldn’t weigh down the stock over the long term.
Specifically, Amazon overbuilt, over-hired, and over-extended itself during the pandemic when the world was isolated at home and forced to shop online. The company is now working to course correct, laying off nearly 20,000 staff, closing fulfillment centers around the world, and delaying the launch of several projects. If chief executive Andy Jassy and his team can right the ship, there is every reason to believe that AMZN stock will continue growing into the future.
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
We mentioned that Apple is Warren Buffett’s most widely held position and that AAPL stock has delivered huge gains to Berkshire Hathaway. However, Berkshire itself is no slouch as an investment. In fact, the stock has been a juggernaut for long-term buy-and-hold investors for decades. Berkshire Hathaway’s Class A stock has doubled twice in the past decade. Since 1990, the stock has grown more than eight million percent.
That kind of growth is mind-boggling. So too, is the current $480,000 share price of the Class A stock, which has never split. The Class A shares have gotten so hefty that stock exchanges have had to be reconfigured to enable them to continue trading on their bourse. Berkshire’s Class B stock, which trades at a ratio of 1/1,500th of the Class A stock, is more reasonably priced at $317 per share currently. Any way you slice it, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has proven to be a stupendous long-term investment.
Dexcom (DXCM)
Source: FOOTAGE VECTOR PHOTO / Shutterstock.com
Probably the least well-known stock on this list is Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM). The San Diego-based medical device company makes continuous glucose monitoring systems for people who have Diabetes. And its glucose monitoring systems have become the standard in the U.S. and many other countries around the world. This has led to big gains in DXCM stock over the long term. Consider that the company’s share price has increased 675% in the last five years and gained more than 2,800% over the past 10 years. Since going public in 2005, the stock has been up more than 4,000%.
The current share price of $108 looks expensive, with a price-earnings ratio of more than 200. However, analysts remain bullish on DXCM stock, with a median price target on the shares of $130, suggesting a further 20% upside from current levels. Dexcom continues to benefit from its focus on treating Diabetes and its market-leading position when it comes to innovative glucose monitoring systems. The company continues to bring new Diabetes management products to market and is forecasting that it will grow 32.9% in each of the next five years. This is a stock built for the long term.
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)
Source: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com
Any investor who got in on Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) IPO nearly 20 years ago is sitting pretty today. That’s because GOOGL stock has risen more than 3,250% since the tech giant made its market debut in August 2004. More recently, the share price has gained 60% in the past five years. In the last 12 months, Alphabet has undertaken a 20-for-1 stock split that has made the shares much more affordable. A 33% decline in the share price has also helped make the stock cheap at its current level of $91. The price-earnings ratio of 18 is the lowest it has been in more than a decade.
Investors looking for a best-in-class tech company should give serious consideration to buying GOOGL stock while it’s on sale. With the online advertising market recovering and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes nearing their conclusion, the outlook for Alphabet and its share price is brightening. Plus, Alphabet continues to grow its market share in sectors ranging from smartphones and artificial intelligence to cloud computing and wearable tech. The company’s balance sheet is fortified for an economic downturn, and Alphabet continues to generate huge amounts of cash, primarily from digital advertisements. This is a stock built for the long term.
Costco (COST)

Big box retailer Costco’s (NASDAQ:COST) stock seems to outperform in any type of market. COST stock has been flat over the last year, up 153% in the last five years, and has gained nearly 400% during the past decade. Since the year 2000, the Seattle-based company’s share price has risen 1,000%. This is a testament to Costco’s strong business model, durable competitive advantage, and the near cult-like devotion of its customers who pay an annual membership fee to shop at the warehouse club.
Costco’s same-store sales growth has remained consistently strong throughout the pandemic and economic reopening; the company is expanding into new service areas that include travel, home improvement, and business services, and its membership renewal rate is above 95%, the industry gold standard. Costco’s net sales in its most recent fiscal year, which ended October 2022, totaled $222.7 billion, up 16% from the previous year and an all-time record for the company. No wonder Yahoo Finance named Costco its 2022 “Company of the Year.” Investors with a long time horizon should definitely consider a position in COST stock.

2023-01-24 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia (NVDA) Gains As Market Dips: What You Should Know,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-nvda-gains-as-market-dips%3A-what-you-should-know-4,"Nvidia (NVDA) closed at $192.65 in the latest trading session, marking a +0.38% move from the prior day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.07% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.31%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 3.22%.
Heading into today, shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence had gained 26.22% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 11.67% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.64% in that time.
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Nvidia as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be February 22, 2023. On that day, Nvidia is projected to report earnings of $0.81 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 38.64%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $6.01 billion, down 21.31% from the year-ago period.
NVDA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.26 per share and revenue of $26.94 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -26.58% and +0.09%, respectively.
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.01% lower. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).
In terms of valuation, Nvidia is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 58.81. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 16.95.
Also, we should mention that NVDA has a PEG ratio of 4.89. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Semiconductor - General was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.36 at yesterday's closing price.
The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 203, which puts it in the bottom 20% of all 250+ industries.
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

2023-01-25 00:00:00+00:00,Semiconductor ETFs in Focus Ahead of Q4 Earnings,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/semiconductor-etfs-in-focus-ahead-of-q4-earnings,"The semiconductor space has been surging over the past three months on improving demand from chips suppliers, data centers, PC manufacturers, and mobile phone producers, as well as China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained more than 30% from a two-year low in mid-October, outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, which added about 10% in the same period.

As such, Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH and First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL have gained 25.7%, 26.3%, 29.2% and 23.3%, respectively, over the past three months. The strong trend is likely to continue in the weeks ahead as the Q4 earnings season picks up pace. Texas Instruments TXN came up with robust results, beating revenue and earnings estimates for the fourth quarter. The result is expected to add fuel to the sector.

Easing inflation and hopes of a less hawkish Fed fueled the rally in the overall tech sector. Additionally, the analyst Barclays Capital upped its stance on some chip stocks ahead of earnings, suggesting that the worst might be over for semiconductors (read: Is the Worst Over for Semiconductor Stocks & ETFs?).

Semiconductors have been the most important drivers of the overall growth in technology, given the use of chips in day-to-day life from cars, electronic gadgets, to planes and weapons. The demand will continue to trend higher given the increased digitization in various corners like healthcare, transport, financial systems, defense, agriculture and retail, among others.

The rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology like cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, 5G and other advanced information technologies should continue to fuel growth. Further, the introduction of expensive and new-generation chips has been leading to an enhancement in the product mix for semiconductors.

Some other well-known players in the space, such as Intel INTC, Qualcomm QCOM, NVIDIA NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD, will report earnings in the coming days. Let’s delve into the financial picture of the companies that have a higher allocation in the above-mentioned ETFs and the power to move the funds up or down as Q4 earnings unfold. SOXQ is largely concentrated on four firms with a combined share of 28.2%, followed by 24.6% for SOXX, 23.1% for SMH and 13.6% for FTXL.

Per our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Inside Our Earnings Prediction
Intel is slated to release earnings after market close on Jan 26. It has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The stock saw negative earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Intel delivered an earnings surprise of 11.36%, on average, for the preceding four quarters.

Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -1.92%. The stock witnessed negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter and delivered an earnings surprise of 5.36% in the trailing four quarters, on average. The company is expected to report earnings after the closing bell on Feb 2 (see: all the Technology ETFs here).

NVIDIA, expected to report on Feb 22, has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3.31%, on average, over the past four quarters. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the quarter to be reported.

Advanced Micro Devices has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -0.11%. Its earnings surprise history is impressive, with the average beat being 12.20% for the preceding four quarters. The stock witnessed no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the quarter to be reported. The company is slated to report earnings on Jan 31 after the closing bell.
Conclusion
Though the stocks have an unfavorbale Zacks Rank, semiconductor ETFs might see smooth trading in the weeks ahead as SOXX, SMH and FTXL have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 or 2. This suggests outperformance in the weeks ahead (read: ETFs to Play Nasdaq's Fastest Start Since 2019).

2023-01-26 00:00:00+00:00,"This ""Golden"" Technical Indicator is Triggering Across the Market",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-golden-technical-indicator-is-triggering-across-the-market,"What is a Golden Cross?
Technical analysis is the best way for investors to determine potential trend changes in individual equities and equity markets. Though technical analysis can get complicated, simple and highly reliable signals exist for analysts who prefer “bar napkin” technical research. One such signal is the “Golden Cross”. Golden Cross refers to the phenomenon where a faster-moving average (50-day MA is most common) crosses over a slower moving average (200-day MA).

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
When a Golden Cross triggers in a particular security or index, it is a signal to technical analysts that a major trend change has occurred, and the long-term trend has flipped from bearish to bullish.
Death Cross Means Caution
On the contrary, a “Death Cross” is the opposite of a Golden Cross. A Death Cross triggers when the short-term moving average (50-day MA) is above the longer-term moving average (200-day MA) and crosses below it. In March of last year, a death cross in the Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ was an early signal that 2022 would be a rough year for bulls.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Pros and Cons of Crosses
The Golden Cross signal has many positives, which include:
·      Ease of identification: Simply bring up a daily chart of an instrument and add the 50- and 200-day MAs.
·      Eliminates Guess Work: By becoming more mechanical, investors can evaluate trend changes based on fact does not bias.
·      A Meaningful Signal:Because cross signals are rare, they are more meaningful.  
Like all signals, crosses are not perfect. Cons include:
·      Delayed Response: Since the signal is long-term, it does usually work right away.
·      False Signals:Investors should be cautious in a sideways market, as the cross can produce false signals.
  What are the Market and Key Industry Groups telling us?
In general, the pros outweigh the cons for investors looking for a largely reliable long-term signal. At present, some key markets and stocks are nearing signals or have already triggered them. For example, the Spdr S&P 500 ETF SPY, the most widely followed market ETF, is approaching a Golden Cross. A successful cross in this index would bode well for U.S. markets in 2023.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Wednesday, the Vaneck Semiconductor ETF SMH triggered a Golden Cross. Semiconductors are a key industry group and often lead the market higher. Recent strides in AI are sending stocks like Nvidia NVDA higher.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Another welcome sign is that beaten-down industries like biotech are now triggering Golden Crosses. The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF XBI is the most popular ETF tracking the space. Both large-cap and small-cap biotech stocks such as Biogen Inc BIIB and Madrigal Pharmaceuticals MDGL are participating in the rally.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Breakdown
Golden Crosses and Death Crosses have proven to be reliable indicators in past years. Investors should understand the pros and cons of the signal and accept that it is not a panacea but rather an indication of a potential trend change. Looking at today’s market, several important industry groups have already triggered Golden Crosses – though the most significant signal has yet to trigger. Watch to see if the S&P 500 can trigger a Golden Cross to confirm that the overall market has shifted back to the bull side.

2023-01-31 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Just Sounded a Warning Bell. Here's What It Means for Nvidia and AMD Stocks.,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-just-sounded-a-warning-bell.-heres-what-it-means-for-nvidia-and-amd-stocks.,"The economy has been the single biggest factor driving Wall Street over the past year with technology stocks taking the biggest beating. Investors have been watching financial reports closely for indications of where things might go from here and paying particular attention to what executives have to say about the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds. So when Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) reported its earnings, management's commentary took on a whole new importance.
While the company's results were disappointing, it was what executives had to say about the future that turned heads. Management's comments suggest tough times lie ahead -- not only for Intel but for rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) as well.
Image source: Getty Images.
A swing and a miss
Investors were expecting the challenging macroeconomic conditions to affect Intel's results, but things were worse than many anticipated. Fourth-quarter revenue of $14.0 billion fell 32% year over year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.10, which plunged 92%. To give those numbers context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $14.5 billion and EPS of $0.20, so Intel's results missed the mark by a wide margin.
Fueling the dismal results were challenges across Intel's largest segments. Revenue from the client computing group (PCs and laptops) slumped 36% year over year to $6.6 billion, while data center and artificial intelligence revenue fell 33% to $4.3 billion. The network and edge segment held up better but still edged 1% lower to $2.1 billion.
Yet as disappointing as the financial results were, it was Intel's outlook that spooked investors across the semiconductor industry.
The big bad
Intel's outlook was the first shoe to drop. In the first quarter, management expects revenue to fall 40% to $11.0 billion at the midpoint of its guidance while swinging to an adjusted loss per share of $0.15, compared to EPS of $1.34 in the prior-year quarter.
The speed at which Intel's business fell off a cliff took the market by surprise, sending many Intel investors running for the exits. Perhaps more alarming, however, was when the second shoe dropped -- management's comments about what it expects from the economy in 2023.
Intel said it expects ""persistent economic headwinds through at least the first half of 2023."" While that part wasn't a surprise, comments from CEO Pat Gelsinger about the state of the data center market raised eyebrows (emphasis mine).
""We expect Q1 server consumption TAM [total addressable market] to decline both sequentially and year over year at an accelerated rate, with 2023's first-half server consumption TAM down year on year, before returning to growth in the second half,"" Gelsinger said on the earnings call.
While that's not the end of the world, it highlights the growing importance of the data center market to the semiconductor industry, and what it could mean for upcoming results.
Things could get ugly for Nvidia and AMD
To understand the implications for Nvidia, one need only review its recent results and the challenges. For the first nine months of fiscal 2023 (which started Jan. 31, 2022), the data center segment was responsible for 54% of Nvidia's total revenue, up from 39% in fiscal 2022.
Furthermore, in its fiscal 2023 third quarter (ended Oct. 30, 2022), Nvidia's data center segment did all the heavy lifting as revenue grew 31% year over year to $3.8 billion. At the same time, gaming revenue -- which has historically represented the lion's share of Nvidia's sales -- plunged 51% to $1.6 billion. Overall, revenue of $5.9 billion tumbled 17%.
AMD's results have held up better so far this year, but the company is similarly dependent on its data center business. The segment represented 24% of its revenue during the first nine months of 2022, compared to 22% during the prior-year period.
Context matters
While it's easy to see why Nvidia and AMD investors would be nervous, it's important to put this information in context. It was just May of last year that Nvidia and AMD each reported record quarterly sales with revenue growing 46% and 71%, respectively. The timing of their decelerating revenue growth coincides with the downturn in the macroeconomic environment. This suggests that Nvidia and AMD will get their groove back once the economy regains its footing.
It's also important to remember that investing is a marathon, not a sprint. While there will no doubt be challenges ahead, over the long term, Nvidia and AMD have proven their mettle. In fact, I'd argue that three to five years from now, investors who held their ground -- or even bought shares of Nvidia or AMD -- will be glad they did.

2023-02-01 00:00:00+00:00,Samsung's newest Galaxy S smartphones a test of brand power in weak market,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/samsungs-newest-galaxy-s-smartphones-a-test-of-brand-power-in-weak-market,"By Joyce Lee
SEOUL, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics 005930.KS unveiled its latest premium smartphones on Wednesday, in a test of its brand power as the market for mobiles undergoes unprecedented contraction.
The Galaxy S23 smartphone series has better cameras and faster chips than its predecessor, but analysts said early sales would face weak demand as consumers spent less on discretionary goods amid surging inflation.
The top-line S23 Ultra has Samsung's first-ever 200-megapixel camera sensor, offering clearer photos after enlargement, and the series has adopted Qualcomm's QCOM.O Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile processor, which is faster than chips used in the S22.
The S23 is the first Samsung phone to use Nvidia's NVDA.O GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card for games with heavy processor demands and for live-streaming playability. Many consumers judge a phone's quality based on those functions.
Samsung is working with companies such as Epic Games to optimise gaming experience on the phone.
In the United States, the base Galaxy S23 will be priced from $799 and two higher-specification versions, the S23 Plus and S23 Ultra, from $999 and $1,199, respectively. Samsung kept the prices at the same level as for last year's model despite rises in component costs.
But global smartphone shipments showed the largest-ever decline in a single quarter in the October-December period, when they were down 18.3% on a year earlier at 300.3 million units, according to data issued by research firm IDC last month. The figures cast doubt on forecasts for modest recovery in the market for mobiles this year.
In that tough environment, analysts said Samsung's mobile strategy would centre on profitability through premium offerings, including the S series and foldables.
""Samsung can't afford to focus on expanding volume anymore,"" said Liz Lee, associate director at research firm Counterpoint.
""It must boldly simplify low- and mid-range products, the parts of the market where Chinese competitors have caught up a lot.""
Samsung said on Tuesday that a decline in low- and mid-range smartphone sales in the fourth quarter had been greater than expected.
With the launch of the S23, the company is also improving interconnectivity of its devices to lock customers into using Samsung products rather than deserting to devices from Apple AAPL.O and other rivals. Analysts say Samsung has far to go in interconnectivity, however.
The company said that, in an industry first, the mouse cursor of its recent Galaxy Book laptop could move directly into a Samsung phone screen to click on things. Users would have to upgrade their phone's software to use that feature, it said.

2023-02-02 00:00:00+00:00,3 Ultra-Profitable Businesses to Invest in for the Long Haul,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-ultra-profitable-businesses-to-invest-in-for-the-long-haul,"One thing you should always consider when choosing a stock is how profitable the underlying business is. If its profit margins are low, then it could easily swing to a loss if it faces headwinds or the economy as a whole struggles. A higher profit margin can also create an important buffer for the business, allowing it to reduce prices if it needs to be more competitive or to better handle inflationary pressures.
Three businesses that are performing exceptionally well with profit margins of 20% and higher include AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Visa (NYSE: V). These are stocks that should do well this year regardless of inflation and could make for excellent long-term investments.
1. AbbVie
Drugmaker AbbVie has reported $13.3 billion in earnings over the trailing 12 months, which is nearly one-quarter (23%) of its top line of $57.8 billion during that time. The business has been expanding over the years, helped by its $63 billion purchase of Botox-maker Allergan in 2019, which diversifies its operations and gives it a new growth opportunity.
Between immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care, and other products, AbbVie's business looks solid and poised for more growth in the years ahead.
While investors are concerned with the looming patent cliff for Humira, its top-selling rheumatoid arthritis medication, management is confident that immunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq combined can ultimately make up for the loss in revenue.
The healthcare company's rock-solid operations have enabled AbbVie to generate free cash flow of just under $22 billion over the past year, putting it in great shape to withstand any headwinds that may come up.
2. Nvidia
Chipmaker Nvidia has made for a solid growth investment over the years, and it hasn't compromised profitability along the way. Sales for fiscal 2022 (which ended on Jan. 31, 2022) totaled $26.9 billion and were more than double the $10.9 billion that the company reported just a few years earlier.
The growing popularity of crypto and more companies moving more of their operations online, in part due to the pandemic, have led to stronger demand for faster and better computers.
What's impressive is that at $9.8 billion, the company's profit margin was an incredible 36% of its top line during its most recent fiscal year. Although profits have come under pressure due to rising labor costs and worsening supply chain issues, its profit margin has still been impressive at 21% over the trailing 12 months.
Concerns about softening demand for personal computers has made many investors bearish on the stock of late, but in the long run this is still a fantastic business to invest in -- Nvidia is a top name in graphics cards and that's not likely to change anytime soon.
3. Visa
Credit card companies are among the most profitable businesses in the world. While there's always a risk of consumer default, these businesses are good at hedging risk and setting aside money for that danger.
In January, Visa released numbers for its fiscal 2023's first quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2022), and net revenue grew 15% to $7.9 billion when excluding the impact of foreign currency. Profits totaling $4.2 billion were up by just 6% but still represented an impressive 53% of the top line.
With Visa generating numbers like that amid inflation and when concerns are rising about the health of the consumer, those are some impressive results. Although it may not be as high of a growth rate as in previous quarters for Visa, the business still looks to be in fantastic shape.
And as the economy strengthens, its bottom line could improve even further, making this an even better buy right now before that happens.

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the NVDA options chain for the new May 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $195.00 strike price has a current bid of $12.25. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $195.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $182.75 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of NVDA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $215.04/share today.
Because the $195.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.28% return on the cash commitment, or 21.85% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for NVIDIA Corp, and highlighting in green where the $195.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $225.00 strike price has a current bid of $18.85. If an investor was to purchase shares of NVDA stock at the current price level of $215.04/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $225.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.40% if the stock gets called away at the May 19th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if NVDA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for NVIDIA Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing NVDA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $225.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $225.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.77% boost of extra return to the investor, or 30.48% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $215.04) to be 64%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2023-02-06 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Moves -0.05%: What You Should Know,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-nvda-stock-moves-0.05%3A-what-you-should-know,"Nvidia (NVDA) closed at $210.89 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.05% move from the prior day. This change was narrower than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.61%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.1%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.67%.
Coming into today, shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence had gained 42% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 17.44%, while the S&P 500 gained 8.32%.
Investors will be hoping for strength from Nvidia as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 22, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Nvidia to post earnings of $0.81 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 38.64%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $6.01 billion, down 21.31% from the year-ago period.
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.
Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.85% lower. Nvidia is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).
Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Nvidia has a Forward P/E ratio of 48.26 right now. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.86.
We can also see that NVDA currently has a PEG ratio of 4.05. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Semiconductor - General industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 3.32 as of yesterday's close.
The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 49, which puts it in the top 20% of all 250+ industries.
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

A.I. Mania: 3 Rare Pure-Plays to Monitor
The Emergence of AI
Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) has garnered widespread attention from users and investors after the viral rollout of the AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT. To give you an idea of how successful the launch has been, ChatGPT is now the fastest consumer app to reach 100 million active users – taking just two months to reach the milestone. As a result of the meteoric rise to popularity, privately held ChatGPT creator OpenAI has secured more than $10 billion in investments from Microsoft.
Companies like Amazonhave been using AI under the hood for years. For example, Amazon leverages AI on its back end to increase sales on its e-commerce platform (if you add a table to your shopping cart, it will suggest chairs). Microsoft is not the only publicly traded company making bold bets in the AI space to compensate. The emergence of ChatGPT has exhibited not only the power and versatility of AI technology but also the threat to existing tech juggernauts.
AI technology may not only disrupt technology, but it is also likely to impact investments. The recent awakening is causing tech giants such as Alphabetto take notice and action. Friday, Alphabet announced an investment of $300 million in AI start-up Anthropic. Meanwhile, IBM has been on a spending spree of its own, attempting to bolster the firm’s AI presence by acquiring a handful of small AI-centric firms in recent months.   
Can AI Move the Needle?
Though the new investments by the dominant tech players are significant from a dollar perspective, they are unlikely to move the needle in the short term for a company like Alphabet, which has a market cap of over $1 trillion, or Microsoft, which has a market cap of nearly $2 trillion.
Because the technological advances in the space are still relatively new and many companies are privately held and small in size, investors are left with little in the way of AI stocks to choose from. Fortunately, there are three public companies that recently IPOed and are pure plays on emerging technology, including:
1.   C3.ai Inc: C3.ai is an enterprise AI software provider that aims to develop, deploy, and operate large-scale AI, predictive analytics, and IoT applications. Since going public, the stock’s performance has been dismal. AI traded as high as $180 in its third week of trading in 2020, only to crash to as low as $10 last year.
However, the recent AI hype, rising revenue, and a narrower than anticipated loss in the company’s recent earnings report have driven shares higher and changed the character of the stock. Over the past three months, the stock is up by more than 100% on massive volume. Surprisingly, more shares traded hands last week than the week of the IPO.
Though C3 has yet to turn a profit as a public company, its revenue has been growing for several quarters, and the company has onboarded some impressive clients including, the U.S. Airforce, utility giant Consolidated Edison and Koch Industries (the second largest privately held company in the United States).
At present, avoid shares of C3 because they are extended in price and hold a lowly Zacks Ranking of 4. Nevertheless, investors should keep an eye on the stock over the coming months. C3 is one of the few AI pure plays available to public investors, and the recent buying pressure in shares suggests that investors are anticipating a turnaround.
2.   Veritone Inc: Veritone is a firm that runs a proprietary cloud-based digital asset management platform focused on leveraging AI technology and its benefits to clients in the media, politics, legal, and law enforcement industries. Veritone’s niche in digital asset management has attracted some noteworthy clients, such as the Los Angeles Chargers football organization. The Chargers have more than 60 years of video content stored.
Organizing such a large amount of content can be a headache and requires several employees and a lot of money. That is until they took advantage of Veritone’s platform. Veritone’s solution organizes, stores, and makes the content searchable, like Google.
Like C3, Veritone has taken investors on a rollercoaster ride since coming public in 2017. With that said, the stock has been on the rebound and has garnered the attention of investors in recent weeks.
Veritone has only produced one profitable quarter since going public. That said, top-line growth has been strong – VERI has consistently achieved mid to high double-digit revenue growth since going public.  
3.   Bigbear AI Holdings: Bigbear.ai is a provider of artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud-based analytics, and cyber engineering solutions. Through AI, Bigbear aims to provide its clients with a clearer view of their current data, better predictability of future outcomes, and “pathways to navigate changing conditions.”
Like Veritone and C3, BBAI gets its revenue from various industries, including government (intelligence analysis), healthcare, and manufacturing. BBAI shares have gone on an impressive run over the past few weeks – rocketing from a low of $0.58 to a high of around $6. However, the company is tiny, unprofitable, and holds a poor Zacks rating of 4.
Takeaway
For now, the current AI craze loosely echoes “blockchain mania” from a few years ago. During this period, any company with “blockchain” in its name rocketed higher as the speculative juices began to flow on Wall Street. In 2017, Long Island Iced Tea Corp switched its branding to “Long Blockchain Corp” to benefit from the hype. Ultimately current earnings power and future earnings runway began to matter again in the blockchain stocks, and I suspect the same will happen in AI–related stocks. The likely scenario in the stocks mentioned above is that they have benefitted from hype, small floats, and speculation in recent weeks.
Nevertheless, it never hurts to begin researching a novel, innovative industry such as AI. For pure plays, patience is required. Secondary beneficiaries such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices currently have more favorable reward-to-risk profiles.

2023-02-09 00:00:00+00:00,3 Red-Hot Stocks That Could Continue to Beat the Market,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-red-hot-stocks-that-could-continue-to-beat-the-market-5,"Generally speaking, investors want to own a piece of companies with real growth prospects and proven staying power. If they do, stocks' prices will eventually take care of themselves. Conversely, chasing a hot stock simply because it's hot is rarely a great idea. When unsupported rallies take a turn for the worse, the turns can become mighty painful.
There are cases, however, where a red-hot stock rally really is an indication of the company's underlying strength. At the very least, these stocks are worth a closer look. Here's a rundown of three such recently hot prospects you might want to consider for your portfolio.
1. Nvidia
It would be easy to assume the worst of chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) right now. Not only are the warning bells of a semiconductor supply crisis still ringing, but macroeconomic weakness tends to take an exaggerated toll on the technology sector. Revenue for its fiscal 2023 third quarter (ended Oct. 30) dropped 17%, and the top line for its recently ended Q4 is projected to fall over 21%. Sales for the quarter currently underway are expected to slide even more.
And yet, the stock's up nearly 50% over the past month, and still steaming higher.
Why the discrepancy? Two things.
First, much of the recent rally is related to the overzealous selling seen in 2022. The market's just correcting its mistake. Second, investors are seeing the bigger picture, recognizing Nvidia's longer-term potential is incredible despite the current turbulence.
It's easy to overlook, but this company isn't just making graphics cards for video gamers anymore. Data center processors are its biggest business now, and most of its data center offerings are artificial intelligence (AI) computing platforms. That's a very resilient, high-growth arena. Precedence Research predicts the AI hardware market will grow at an average annualized pace of nearly 27% through 2030. Market research outfit Omdia estimates that around 80% of the world's artificial intelligence processors are already made by Nvidia, so it's clearly got the right stuff to help hold onto this dominant degree of market share.
2. Tapestry
It's curious. Consumers are seemingly losing interest in expensive fashion labels, while appreciation for value and quality is growing. Traffic at mall-based department stores also continues to wane as the world finds other, more cost-effective and efficient means of shopping. The shift seemingly works against luxury clothing and accessory specialists like Tapestry (NYSE: TPR), which owns brands such as Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman.
Yet it continues to persevere. While initially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, sales for the fiscal year ending in mid-2021 were up an impressive 16%. They grew the same amount for the next 12 months. Revenue is on pace to roll in a little below last year's top line for fiscal 2023 ending in June, but it is then predicted to accelerate again. Oh, and the company is increasingly profitable despite stiff inflation and a wobbly economy.
The explanation for this unlikely success is simple enough: This isn't your mother's (or your grandmother's) Coach and Kate Spade.
It's admittedly so subtle that it's difficult to see. This company, however, is truly connecting with consumers willing and able to spend a bit more than average for access to luxury. It does a significant amount of repair and refurbishment business, for instance, appealing to the buyer that's also worried about the fashion business's impact on the environment. At the same time, Tapestry's management understands its current core customers -- Gen-Z -- are looking to fashion as an expression of their individual style as much as they're looking for affordable luxury.
And yes, it all makes a difference. While Goldman Sachs concedes the average consumer is strapped right now, the investment bank's researchers suggest shoppers are more likely to spend less on basic goods like denim so they can continue to purchase higher-end handbags.
3. SolarEdge Technologies
Finally, add SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ: SEDG) to your list of red-hot stocks that may not be slowing down anytime soon. Its shares notched a 46% gain in the past three months, including a 13% advance over just the past month.
If you're not familiar, SolarEdge makes power inverters for solar panels. The solar panels collect the sun's electricity-producing photons, and inverters like the ones made by SolarEdge convert them into the usable AC electricity being piped to your home's light fixtures and wall sockets. As it turns out, while they're generally efficient enough, poorly conceived inverters have been as big of hurdle to mainstreaming solar power as relatively inefficient panels were at one point. Not only can SolarEdge's inverters be easily managed with an app, but they also integrate nicely with solar's common add-ons like EV chargers and battery-based power storage.
There's never been a better time to be in the business, either. New legislation turned into federal law in the middle of last year boosts the industry in a big way. Namely, the Defense Production Act encourages more domestic production of solar panels, while the Inflation Reduction Act offers generous tax credits for all facets of new solar power system installations. Much of the rest of the world is taking similar stimulative measures as well.
These tailwinds are expected to make a major impact, too. The International Energy Agency indicates the planet's annual pace of solar panel installations will quadruple between 2022 and 2030. This market growth is a key reason SolarEdge Technologies' top line is expected to have grown by nearly 60% last year, and will likely rise another 30% this year.

Feb 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed higher on Monday as investors awaited inflation data likely to hint at the path of the Federal Reserve's future interest rate hikes, while Meta Platforms gained after a report that the Facebook parent was planning fresh layoffs.
MetaMETA.O jumped after the Financial Times reported on Sunday that the company was preparing to announce a new round of job cuts, adding to layoffs last November.
Microsoft MSFT.O, Nvidia NVDA.O, Apple AAPL.O and Amazon AMZN.O also gained. Along with Meta, those tech-related heavyweights contributed more than any other stocks to the S&P 500's gains for the session.
Helping lift Microsoft, Stifel raised its price target on the software company and said it is clearly looking to upend Alphabet's Google search dominance through its integration with ChatGPT.
Investors are laser-focused on January inflation data due on Tuesday to reassess their bets on the central bank's monetary policy path.
Wall Street's main indexes lost ground last week after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that interest rates may need to move higher than expected in the central bank's battle against inflation.
""Today is just a natural reaction in the opposite direction after we've seen very heavy selling pressure,"" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta.
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 46.50 points, or 1.15%, to end at 4,137.48 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC gained 174.12 points, or 1.49%, to 11,892.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 374.45 points, or 1.11%, to 34,243.72.
So far in this year, the S&P 500 has gained about 8%, and the index remains down about 14% from its record high close in January 2022.
Fidelity National Information Services IncFIS.N plunged following the banking and payments processing conglomerate's decision to spin off its merchant payments business.
Coca-Cola KO.N rose ahead of its quarterly report due out early on Tuesday.
As U.S. quarterly earnings reports wind down, 69% of the S&P 500 firms that have reported results so far have exceeded profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data. Analysts expect December-quarter earnings to have fallen nearly 3% from a year earlier.

Investors shrugged off recession talk and mixed earnings reports on Monday to erase much of last week’s losses. It was another example of a ‘buy the dip’ mentality that has prevailed thus far in 2023 — and has the S&P 500 up 8% year-to-date.
As global equities continue to drift from their October 2022 low, broad sector participation lends credence to the recovery. All 11 GICS sectors have advanced since October 13th. The industrials, financials, materials and technology groups are each up at least 20%.
For U.S. large caps, the bull run has also been well attended at the sector level, but a select few mega caps have the biggest impact. Warner Bros. Discovery, Catalent and Align Tech have gained more than 50%, but their small S&P 500 weightings limit their overall contribution.  The benchmark’s largest components — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon — are up in 2023, but aren’t having the same influence as in years past. 
With a combined weighting of more than 4%, its strength in these three tickers that have much to do with the S&P’s 2023 performance.
Tesla’s Prices Are Falling…Why Is the Stock Rising? 
Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) accounts for nearly 1% of the S&P 500’s 8% year-to-date return. No other company in the index is off to a hotter start. 
The EV leader found another gear after it reported 40% earnings growth for the fourth quarter. The result surpassed Wall Street’s expectations and demonstrated positive vehicle production and delivery trends. Better profits in the less-discussed Energy Generation & Storage business also helped push Tesla over the top.
In contrast to the higher average selling prices for Tesla’s sedans and SUVs witnessed in Q4, price cuts have been the theme in the current quarter. As much as $13,000 was slashed from the Model 3 and Model Y stickers in the U.S., and similar rollbacks have been implemented in the Greater China market. 
Tesla’s shift from being a luxury brand for the affluent to an affordable brand for the masses has been remarkable. From 2017 to 2022, the average price on a Tesla EV was halved. During the same period, operating margins went from red to black. This long-term trend has investors unfazed by the recent price cuts and Tesla at the front of the S&P 500 race.
Which Company Is Driving the Semiconductor Rally?
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) has roughly the same weighting as Tesla in the S&P 500. Its 49% year-to-date climb is a big reason why stocks are off to their best start since 2019. The chipmaker is also leading a resurgence in semiconductors which, alongside auto manufacturers, is this year’s best-performing industry. It’s a fitting duo given NVIDIA’s recent push into the auto market.
Last month, the company announced that it joined forces with the world’s leading tech manufacturer Foxconn to develop automated EVs. Foxconn will produce electronic control units (ECUs) based on the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin chip. The technology will present automakers with an all-in-one solution for self-driving capabilities and an AI command center.
Although NVIDIA’s automotive segment is a small part of the business, this is a significant step towards being an influential tech player in the global EV and autonomous vehicle markets.
Whether or not the volatile stock’s recent gains hold up will likely depend on next week’s earnings release. If management can show continued strength in data centers and an improvement in gaming, NVIDIA could overtake Tesla as this year’s top S&P stock. If the report is disappointing, look for it to have a significant drag on market direction.
Is Meta Platforms Stock Headed Back to $200?
Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) gapped up in good volume on better-than-feared fourth-quarter revenue. Despite continued weakness in advertising demand, the market felt the worst might be over for Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. 
Some $4.2 billion in cost cutting measures tied to layoffs, facilities consolidation and nixing several data center projects helped Meta Platform reduce its 2023 expense guidance. This was the report's highlight because it showed expense reductions are working and profits could improve as the economy does the same. 
The stock’s 23% post-earnings jump was supported by a favorable regulatory ruling on the same day of the report. A federal judge shot down the FTC’s request to block Meta’s takeover of virtual reality fitness game maker Within Limited.
The FTC’s assertion that this would limit competition in the VR fitness app market proved unfounded. Being able to proceed with the deal for the Supernatural app maker is significant for two reasons: 1) the app’s popularity will give Meta Platform a major inroad to the fast-growing VR space, and 2) an antitrust victory of any magnitude bodes well for Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse ambitions.
Meta shares have sold off since reaching their highest level since June 2022 but, up 49% year-to-date, are having a big impact on the overall market. The consensus price target points to a potential return to $200, with some analysts forecasting a push toward $300.

Feb 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were on track to open sharply lower on Thursday after stronger-than-expected producer prices data fed into fears that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates to tame stubbornly high inflation.
A Labor Department report showed producer prices climbed 0.7% in January after a 0.2% fall in the previous month. Economists polled by Reuters expected a 0.4% increase in January.
Another set showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, offering more evidence of the economy's resilience despite the tighter monetary policy.
""You're seeing the inflation numbers continue to be higher than expected and not really showing disinflation and now the expectations are that the Fed is likely to take rates higher and be more aggressive going forward,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance at Charlotte, North Carolina.
""You're also seeing the job market still very strong as well, with claims coming in less than expected,"" Zaccarelli added.
After a torrid 2022, the main stock indexes have climbed this year on the back of upbeat earnings and expectations that the U.S. central bank will switch to smaller rate hikes, pushing investors to scoop up beaten-down growth stocks.
However, signs of a resilient economy and an acceleration in January consumer prices recently raised concerns among traders that the central bank may not hit pause on its hawkish policies anytime soon, let alone pivot to cutting rates later this year.

Adding to the downbeat mood, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said inflation remains too high and noted that she was open to raising rates by more than what her colleagues wanted at the last monetary policy meeting.
Traders will also scrutinize remarks from other Fed officials, including St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, to assess the central bank's tone on monetary policy.

""The jobs numbers aren't getting weaker, and it's hard to go into a recession with a strong labor market at the same time. That means the Fed could push the button and move rates higher,"" Dollarhide said.

BRUSSELS, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft MSFT.O President Brad Smith on Tuesday will seek to convince EU antitrust regulators at a closed hearing that the U.S. software giant's $69 billion bid for ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard ATVI.O will boost competition.
Smith will lead a delegation of 18 senior executives, including Microsoft Gaming Chief Executive Officer Phil Spencer, while Activision will be represented by its CEO Robert Kotick, a European Commission document seen by Reuters showed.
The hearing will allow Xbox maker Microsoft to gauge the mood among senior EU and national competition officials and European Commission lawyers ahead of the submission of remedies to address antitrust concerns.
""I think we will make clear that our acquisition of Activision Blizzard will bring more games to more people on more devices and platforms than ever before,"" Smith told reporters on his way to the hearing.
Microsoft was willing to address concerns with ""Call of Duty"" licensing offers similar to the 10-year deal with Nintendo 7974.T and regulatory undertakings, Smith added, without providing any further details.
Microsoft announced the Activision acquisition in January last year to take on leaders Tencent 0700.HK and Sony 6758.T, but has run into regulatory headwinds in Europe, Britain and the United States.
Sony, which wants the deal to be blocked, sent its gaming chief Jim Ryan.
Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google and chip designer and computing firm Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, which has a gaming business, also took part in the hearing.
""The European Commission asked for our views in the course of their inquiries into this issue. We will continue to cooperate in any processes, when requested, to ensure all views are considered,"" a Google spokesperson said.
Nvidia declined to comment. The European Games Developer Federation, which has said the deal will allow Microsoft to challenge Apple AAPL.O, Google and Tencent, is one of the participants.
Video game distributor Valve, video game publisher Electronic Arts EA.O and the German competition watchdog and its peers in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden will also be taking part in the event.

Feb 24 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes posted their biggest weekly drop of 2023 after sharp losses on Friday, as investors braced for the possibility of more aggressive rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve as U.S. economic data pointed to resilient consumers.
For the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, the 3% fall was its biggest weekly decline since September. It was also the Dow's fourth straight weekly decline, its longest losing streak for nearly 10 months.
The S&P 500 .SPX and Nasdaq Composite .IXIC were also down 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively.
After a strong January, stocks have retreated this month as a slew of economic data amplified worries that the U.S. central bank might have to keep rates higher for longer.
Data on Friday showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, shot up 0.6% last month after gaining just 0.2% in December. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 1.8% last month, exceeding forecasts for a 1.3% rise.
Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede, said previous market cycles had witnessed similar delayed reactions by the market to rising interest rates and data releases, which helps explain volatile trading patterns as investors slowly adjust.
""This market has not yet realized the likelihood of a recession that we think is reality,"" he said, noting past rate hikes normally had taken between six and 18 months before their effects had fully filtered through into the economy.
""We don't think (a recession is) a given, but there's a higher likelihood than the market has embedded in its thought process.""
Traders of futures tied to the Fed's policy rate added to bets of at least three more rate hikes this year, with the peak rate seen in the range of 5.25%-5.5% by June.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said the Fed should raise interest rates higher than necessary if need be to get inflation fully under control.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 336.99 points, or 1.02%, to 32,816.92, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 42.28 points, or 1.05%, to 3,970.04 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 195.46 points, or 1.69%, to 11,394.94.
Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors fell, with real estate .SPLRCR, technology .SPLRCT and consumer discretionary .SPLRCDthe biggest decliners. Communication services .SPLRCL fell 1.4% to a sixth straight loss, its worst run since a similar six-session skid in August.
Megacap stocks including Tesla Inc TSLA.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O slid between 1.6% and 2.6% as Treasury yields rose. US/
The yield on two-year Treasury notes US2YT=RR, which are highly sensitive to Fed policy, climbed to 4.826% - its highest in nearly four months. US/
Boeing CoBA.N slid 4.8% after the Federal Aviation Administration said the planemaker temporarily halted deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner jets.
Adobe IncADBE.O sank 7.6% on reports the U.S. Justice Department would block the Photoshop maker's $20 billion bid for cloud-based designer platform Figma.
The decline in Adobe's stock was the largest since Sept. 15, the day the Figma agreement was announced.
Meanwhile, Range Resources Corp RRC.N jumped 11.9% in late trading, its biggest gain in nine months, after Bloomberg News reported that Pioneer Natural Resources PXD.N was in talks to buy it. Pioneer's stock fell 4.1% on the report.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.31 billion shares, compared with the 11.53 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
The S&P 500 posted 2 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 44 new highs and 162 new lows.

This video was recorded on Feb. 23, 2023.
Dylan Lewis: AI means big business for Nvidia and Etsy sellers keep selling. Motley Fool Money, starts now.
Dylan Lewis: I'm Dylan Lewis sitting in for Chris Hill and I'm joined by half man, half caffeine, Tim Beyers. Tim, how is it going?
Tim Beyers: That is factually correct, Dylan, and I'm thankful that you got that out of the way.
Dylan Lewis: I'm always thinking about the guest trying to get us right into it. Excited that you're caffeinated; I am too. Earning season keeps rolling. We have a lot to dig into. We have some names that are very familiar to Fools. I'd say we're going to be talking about Etsy a little bit one of the best-performing stocks of the past decade and a company in my portfolio. I'm going to make you wait for the best-performing stock in the last decade or one of the best performing stocks in the last decade and first turn the focus over to myself, Tim, and then what I own. Etsy, is a company that I own and one that I think a lot of Fools own, and a company that has been going through a bit of an interesting period over the last couple of years.
Tim Beyers: I think that's a kind and thoughtful way to think about it. If you read the Etsy earnings release, Dylan, what you will see is the earnings equivalent of a Jedi mind trick. These aren't the last three years you're looking for. You should go back to 2019. There's a lot of mention of three-year comparables in the press release. For example, they will say consolidated gross merchandise sales of 4 billion that was down 4 percent year-over-year, and down 0.7 percent on a currency-neutral basis, but it was up over 145 percent on a three-year basis.
I think what's interesting about this, Dylan, and why we should pay attention to it is Etsy is trying to establish that they have returned to normal, that 2019 was normal, and now, 2023 is normal. The way you should be thinking about Etsy's business is take 2019, slap some growth on it, and now, think about that level as where Etsy should be. Your question as an investor should be, ""Is that fair?"" If it is, then what is normal Etsy look like? Because otherwise, and I know we can get into more numbers. I'll pause there, Dylan, but some of the other numbers are not that great.
Dylan Lewis: Yeah, I think one of the interesting things with this quarter is the company posted just over 800 million in revenue. It came in ahead of estimates. We saw a little bit of disappointment on the earnings per share number, but if you get beyond the estimates and you look at some of those year-over-year numbers. We're talking about a company that grew the top line at 12 percent year-over-year. Really, you mentioned before that gross merchandise sales was down year-over-year. That increase that we're seeing in revenue is more attributable to things like their fees and what they're doing on the advertising side, not so much the activity that's happening on their platform.
Tim Beyers: Right. They've gotten a lot of blowback for those fees. They had an increase earlier in 2022 and there were some sellers which they've done many, many times before, where they said, ""That's it. We're taking a break for certain period of time."" I think this latest boycott was on the order of a week to protest the fee increase. To be fair, Etsy's take rate in terms of what it takes from sellers across all of those merchandise sales to feed its own coffers is not enormous, but they do keep raising it, which makes it harder as an Etsy seller. When the take rate goes up, it does make it harder as an Etsy seller to earn profit on your sales. So I can understand why they are pushing back on this.
But it does say something to me that both on a quarter-over-quarter basis and on a year-over-year basis, those gross merchandise sales were down 4 percent year-over-year in the quarter, 1.3 percent down for the full year. There's a lot of business being done on it, $13.3 billion in 2022 versus 13.5 billion in 2021. What is the healthy Etsy thesis look like? If you go back to 2019 and you look at where this business is going today, theoretically, Dylan, this is going to have to shift some more of that Etsy revenue is going to have to come from gross merchandise sales. So in terms of guidance, that's what we should be looking for and yet, according to these numbers so far, we're not really seeing that.
Dylan Lewis: Yeah. You mentioned the seller perspective there where, I think, the take rates about 20 percent, that was up, I think, 300 basis points year-over-year. There's a natural limit on how much sellers will expect. As a shareholder of the company I don't want to see that being the only thing that's really driving growth for them either, because it's a lever, but it's a lever that really has a natural limit.
Tim Beyers: Right, the kind of things that you don't want to see. Again, if we're going to buy this thesis of Etsy, as 2019 was normal, 2023 will be more normal. Things that we don't want to see are like active sellers being down just under 1 percent year-over-year in both the quarter and for the year, but that's what happened. The active buyer base down 1.3 percent for the quarter and down 1.3 percent also for the year. Really, those aren't great numbers. So what I want to hear from Etsy, and to be fair, I haven't gone through the call to really understand this, but let me tell you what I'm looking for in 2023, I'm looking for how management is pulling levers to get more sellers onto the platform and more buyers onto the platform, because this sustainable Etsy is one that is a much bigger marketplace. If you're expecting as an investor, Dylan, for this company to compound, you want the marketplace to be much bigger, more buyers and more sellers, more than anything else. That's probably going to drive growth here, and right now, those trends are in reverse.
Dylan Lewis: One of the things I wanted to ask you about, Tim, was, I want to give the company some grace, because we did see, basically, a 3x in their top line over the course of three years, which is incredible and that's a big transformation. The story of, ""Look at us on a three year comp,"" is one that Etsy is trying to convince the market of, but they're not the only company that I think is trying to make that comparison. I think a lot of growth companies are trying to tell that story right now. When do you say, ""This is something I'm willing to lend this company,"" and when do you say, ""You know what, I'm going to stick to the year-over-year comps and hold them accountable to what we've been seeing and maybe would judge a company on more traditionally.""?
Tim Beyers: I think that's a really good question. I think I give them more grace when the valuation gets better and gets cheaper, the stock is down slightly today, not by that much. It's about 1.5 percent the last time I looked, Dylan. But overall, the free cash flow for this business in the last fiscal year was, according to my calculations, about $415 million, so that puts the present value, the free cash flow yield for this company at about 2.4 percent, which is pretty good, but it's also not amazing. It certainly doesn't make Etsy look cheap to me. When do I give them more grace? I'm probably a holder here, to be honest with you, like if I held shares, I would be holding and waiting for more management guidance on how they make that marketplace bigger. When I'm willing to pay more of a premium is when I see those key performance indicators, really starting to grow, and grow consistently, grow on a trend line.
When gross merchandise sales is starting to move up into the right, and even more importantly, when active sellers and active buyers, like here would be a really interesting indicator, Dylan. That would be a strong signal to me where if the valuation hadn't changed too much, but these indicators were pointing directionally correct, where I'd be very interested in a buyer. When I see growth in active buyers and active sellers outpace growth in gross merchandise sales. If those two things are growing faster than gross merchandise sales, that tells me there's a leading indicator happening here. The marketplace is growing bigger and the pie is probably going to start accelerating in growth, like, ""Okay, I'm interested."" If the valuation hasn't run away from it at that point, I'm starting to rub my hands and get interested.
Dylan Lewis: Tim, as a shareholder, I would love to see it. Let's hope it happens. I'm right there with you. Another company that has gone through a bit of a transformational couple of years is Nvidia. It's been an incredible performer. It is a company that a lot of Fools own and follow. It has basically pick a tech trend and it has ridden that trend over the last couple of years. The company is up 10 percent today after posting a top and bottom-line, beat this quarter, revenue came in at 6 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter and EPS at 88 cents, both edging out estimates. We also saw what looked like a pretty strong forecast from the company as well. Tim, what jumps out to you looking at the report from Nvidia?
Tim Beyers: Well, it's interesting. I mean, this looks like one where maybe two things are at play. One might be that we had expected a lot less from Nvidia than we should have. But the other, and this is the thing that scares me a little bit. This is another company that I like, that I have been on the recommending end of in multiple services. I do like the company a lot. I don't think the valuation is all that cheap, Dylan. So I wonder how much of this is, ""Oh, boy, Nvidia is going to be supplying. AI as a service to a bunch of cloud companies. Lookout, this thing's going to the moon."" I wonder how much of that is tied into some of the share price today, because the numbers, let's be honest, were not amazing.
Let's hit a couple of things here. Just about of the market platforms, is what Nvidia calls them. There are six of them, four of them were down and down significantly in the fourth quarter. Honestly, year-over-year, Gaming was down 46 percent, Professional Visualization down 65 percent, OEM and other down 56 percent. Sorry, there are five, not six. So three of the five down, automotive was up 135 percent, and then the biggest one, data center was up 11 percent. The numbers are not amazing. Here's the thing that's happening, Nvidia is in a transition. In this last quarter, in the fourth quarter, Nvidia basically generated more than twice the revenue in data center than it did in gaming, which is a real switch.
From years ago, gaming was the business and data center was this minority potion. Now, Nvidia chips, particularly those graphics processor units, you can think of those as like the V12 engines of semiconductor. Large chipsets for large-scale processing, those things are just massive. They do a lot of parallel processing. They're very useful in data centers and that's becoming quite apparent. But the transition, Dylan, is going to be, when does the gaming sector, which to your point, when the gaming sector was gangbusters, guess what was happening? There were lots of people who are doing Bitcoin mining, buying external GPUs, putting them into systems and saying, ""Go get me some Bitcoin because I want to be rich.""
Dylan Lewis: It was the gold rush, Tim.
Tim Beyers: It was the gold rush. That sector has been subject to that over and over and over again, and now, it's on the downswing. I think part of the hope is like the rush to AI will be like, ""Oh, OK. There's going to be a lot of buying of those external GPU cards and here we go, that gaming sector is going to recover."" It's far too early to say that, but this business is healthy, it's just in transition.
Dylan Lewis: You anticipated a question that I was going to get to and I think I might just ask it anyway because I think our listeners are probably looking for a specific take on this, Tim. Every headline that I saw related in Nvidia's earnings name-checked AI.
Tim Beyers: I know.
Dylan Lewis: It seems like you mentioned the crypto boom before and the way that's affected this company. How do you think about the business versus these trends and tailwinds that seem to just pick it up every couple of years, because name something that's been big in tech? Nvidia has been at the intersection of it the last couple of years.
Tim Beyers: It's true. Dylan, I'll just be honest with you here. I hate this and I'm just going to give a hat tip to our coworker, Seth Jason on this, who is much smarter about AI than I am, because he runs our AI service. He's made the point that there has been functional AI around for a really long time. It's just not the generative AI which is ChatGPT. It's been more machine learning. That is highly useful and under the hood and you don't really see it, and that's the good part about it.
I hate seeing in the Nvidia call so many mentions of AI, because that means that there's probably some hype baked into this rally right now that it's not going to be backed up by numbers. Probably, not for a while. Yeah, you're right. I mean, they're getting some tailwind here. I'm going to go ahead and say some of that tailwind is undeserved. Having said that, that doesn't mean that Nvidia is a bad business, it just means that don't get distracted by the shiny thing. Focus on the fact that Nvidia is a wonderful supplier of chips to data centers around the world, and that business is not going away. You don't need to have AI workloads everywhere for Nvidia to sell a boatload of chips into the data center segment. Just please be careful. This is not a screaming AI play, that's just nonsense.
Dylan Lewis: That's a sober and I think really great. Look at that, Tim. I think it's a reminder. It's so easy for us to get carried away when we see a company has exposure to something that is blowing up. Just looking at comments that management has made, Nvidia's CEO was talking about OpenAI and ChatGPT and said that this is the iPhone moment for AI because it is something finally that consumers can wrap their heads around. As investors, we got to take that step back sometimes.
Tim Beyers: You know what? That comment from Jensen Huang. You can look at that comment two ways. You could say, ""Wow, it's an iPhone moment, holy moly. That's amazing,"" and expect that things are going to go to the moon tomorrow or you could look at the actual history of the iPhone. How long did it take for the iPhone to become really the App Store? To become the central piece of the mobile ecosystem that it is today. It took many years. Let's just remember here, for context, the original iPhone, I kid you not, in order to do mapping in the original iPhone, Dylan, I don't know if you remember this, they didn't have a GPS. Do you remember what they were using to render maps in the original iPhone?
Dylan Lewis: I don't. I didn't have an iPhone until the iPhone 3.
Tim Beyers: Okay.
Dylan Lewis: So I was behind the curve on that one.
Tim Beyers: It was WiFi hotspots. That's what it was. There was no GPS chip in the original iPhone. There was a lot of incremental innovation that had to happen before the iPhone really became the iPhone. If you take Jensen Huang at his word, which you can, that's perfectly fine, just take it in the historical context and say, ""I get it. All right. Let's remember the ChatGPT is a toddler and does things badly and we'll get better.""
Dylan Lewis: Listeners, remember, we are in the Wi-Fi hot-spot era of artificial intelligence. There's a long ways to go. Tim, thank you so much for the reminder and thank you for joining me.
Tim Beyers: Thanks, Dylan.
Dylan Lewis: How much money do you make? What class are you in? Do those questions make you a little uncomfortable? Maya Lau is a former investigative reporter for the Los Angeles Times and the host of a new podcast, Other People's Pockets, a show about other people's money. Sierra Baldwin caught up with Lau, discussed her new show and the obstacles to talking about money.
Sierra Baldwin: Before we dive into your show and talk about other people's money, I actually wanted to flip the script a little bit, and ask you, what is your relationship with money?
Maya Lau: My relationship with money is complicated and has changed a lot over time. I was a newspaper reporter for many years and an investigative reporter. I started to get really frustrated about money in terms of my income. Obviously, most people know newspaper reporters don't get paid that much. I always do that going in and I was fine with that. But over time, as I had a kid and started to get a little bit older, not that I am super old, I'm 37, but I started to want the things that people want, like owning a house one day and having more stability.
I started to get really frustrated and I found myself in my personal life just asking a lot of questions about money and wondering things about my friends who had maybe purchased homes or were doing things I wanted to do. I started to get really curious and want to just ask people directly like, ""How much do you make or how did you make that work? How did you make this purchase?"" I think my relationship has changed over time. I mean, I definitely would call myself, somewhat of a, do gooder or think I want to make a positive impact on the world definitely out of college, wanted to work for non-profits, or definitely was not after money. I think that now I'm OK with saying that I want to make a decent amount of money. I don't want to become a billionaire, but I would be fine with making several hundred thousand dollars a year. [laughs] That to me, as of a few years ago, would feel weird to say. Yeah, it's definitely changed and I think I've become a bit more open about my desires.
Sierra Baldwin: That seems to be a big theme of your show. When you're talking to people is really learning what makes them tick and what motivates them when it comes to money and making money and choosing their career pathway. You actually talk to a nuclear physicist who got his PhD, but then could barely get by and ended up pivoting a bit and choosing a career path that provides a little bit more of a lucrative and secure future for his family. Can you talk a little bit about your conversation with him and some of the takeaways that you had?
Maya Lau: Yeah. I talked to Dr. Liam Dodd, who was a nuclear physicist. He worked at some of the world's most prestigious institutions in that line of work. But even so was not paid very much and was literally homeless, was couch surfing, was eating cheese sandwiches and barely able to feed himself. He ended up making a transition into a much more traditional career in used auto sales actually, but still working with data and he's still a scientist, but that was an interesting interview because it really highlighted the fact that your dream job or your passion can be a trap. Physics is his passion.
It's like loving art to hammer music, I mean, it really is the language he wants to live and breathe all the time, but most of the people that can be true physicists their whole lives, like he found that they had family money or there were some other reason why they were able to get by, or they got a super hard to get professorship or something like that. I think that it just illustrated, I've found in my own life that this thing that you might think of as your dream job, sometimes it can be a trap because when you're in that dream job, you don't feel empowered to speak up about pay, about getting paid more. You feel lucky to even be able to have your dream job.
You tell yourself that other people would die for your job and so aren't you lucky? I think that realizing that for some people, there might be an afterward to that, there might be something that comes after that that you never would expect. Sometimes leaving your dream job can be really freeing because it's something you never would expect to do and surprising yourself is really important. That physicist I talked to, I think he's really happy now. He's really stable and he has better quality of life.
Sierra Baldwin: I think that is a dilemma that we all face is whether we should chase our passion or if it has lower income potential or chase the money. Is there anyone that you've spoken to for the first season of the show or who's coming up, who is following a passion, maybe it has a lower-income potential and they've acknowledged that, but they're comfortable with it? If so, what did you learn from them?
Maya Lau: Well, I talked to a chef who has one of the best restaurants in the world. It's considered ""fine-dining"", although he does not like that term because it connotes white tableclothes and which is very much not his restaurant, but he's absolutely following his passion. This is a joy for him even though it is so much work and he doesn't make that much money off of it. He's fine with it though. One of the interesting things about this show is that I'm interested in this idea of jobs that seem really prestigious and are really prestigious yet don't generate that much money and I think that being a chef can be one of them.
He's super celebrated, but the amount of money he makes on the restaurant, in total makes between 100,000-200,000 Australian dollars a year. Most of it is actually from his paid ad promos on Instagram, not from the restaurant. Yeah, I think that there are a lot of people I've spoken to, you're never going to break them away from it and they really are OK with making what they make. For him, the question of what is enough is absolutely about his family and his mental health and getting to do what he loves. He doesn't feel like he's lacking in any way.
Sierra Baldwin: You also talked to a television writer, an astrologers, I think, and an influencer, journalist, young entrepreneur, would you say that there's something that they all have in common when it comes to attitudes toward money?
Maya Lau: I think that most people have shared that money is uncomfortable for them to talk about. On the show, I asked people directly, ""How much money do you make, what's your net worth?"" Things like that, the questions that we all wonder, but few of us feel really OK directly asking people, and most of them have some shame or just have some discomfort around money. Sometimes can't even articulate why, like why does this feel so weird to talk about? It's like talking about sex or something like, I've never talked about this on a podcast before when we talked through, like why do you think it's uncomfortable? I think a lot of it comes from childhood. How money was talked about in your family. There's a recurring idea of if you don't have a lot of money or you don't have what you think is enough money that you feel shame because society tells you that it's a personal failure. It's a character flaw. You should have figured it out. You were too stupid to not figure it out when really none of that is true. That is something that keeps coming around again and again.
Sierra Baldwin: You mentioned that asking people about what socioeconomic class they think they're in, you mentioned that that was one of the tough questions or ones that had a little bit of a harder time responding to. Why do you think that is?
Maya Lau: I wouldn't say it's with all guests, I mean most guess actually do answer that freely. We actually did an episode, that will come out, that is taking a step back after we've done some episodes and talking with an expert on class issues and money issues, and chewing on, not naming names, but these themes came up, like, ""What is that about?"" I asked her that, and she said that, often when people have changed classes, either they've gone up or down. There's a real identity shift. It's very hard for people to accept or it's just odd.
Even if you come from a working class background when you're a child and now, you're say upper middle-class, some people just have a hard time. It's they don't want to betray their working class routes. They feel like they're working class. Those are there people, those are their values. Saying that they're upper middle-class makes them feel like an ass or something, stuff like that. Then sometimes I guess tied to their profession or just not wanting the wider world to think of them a certain way. I'm not sure, but it is a really puzzling, but interesting thing. That's exactly why I love to have these conversations because it's like, ""Why is that?""

The search for top hyper-growth stocks may be less of a priority for many investors. Indeed, while today’s dynamic and fast-paced economy demands that investors always seek opportunities to maximize their returns, these hyper-growth stocks can be more fickle to assess. That’s because while these companies have higher growth rates than the market, they also carry higher risk. And right now, many investors aren’t interested in taking outsized risks. 
That said, these companies are often at the forefront of innovation. The disruption of traditional industries and creation of new markets is something that shouldn’t be avoided.
This article will look at three hyper-growth stocks with the potential for incredible upside. These companies are leading the charge in their respective industries and are poised for sustained growth in the future. From cutting-edge technology to innovative e-commerce platforms, these companies are changing the game and are worth a closer look for investors who are seeking high-growth opportunities.
Accordingly, let’s dive in!
Ticker Company Price
NVDA Nvidia $236.24
SHOP Shopify $40.96
COIN Coinbase $65.08
Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has been around since 1993, is one of the oldest hyper-growth stocks to make this list. This company is best known as a top producer of advanced microprocessors and hardware products. It has established a strong reputation as one of the most desirable chip manufacturers in the world. This is because when it comes to tackling intricate computing assignments like artificial intelligence and machine learning, Nvidia chips are typically the preferred choice.
Nvidia’s high-end graphics cards and custom chips are crucial in the gaming industry and other fast-growing segments like artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency mining. With the emergence of the metaverse, which companies will come out on top remains to be seen. However, regardless of the outcome, Nvidia is a promising investment opportunity with potential significant returns. 
Nvidia has recently released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year. Notably, these results were stronger during the height of the pandemic. The previous year, the company posted a record-setting quarter with revenue of $7.64 billion, $3 billion of which was pure profit. However, in its fiscal 2023 Q4 earnings report, Nvidia projected an income of $6 billion, which is almost exactly where it landed with $6.05 billion in revenue. Finally, the company’s full-year revenue was almost the same as the previous year, at $26.92 billion, but its profit was down substantially.
Shopify (SHOP)

Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has revolutionized the e-commerce industry. This company empowers small and medium-sized businesses to establish online stores quickly through its comprehensive software solutions.
In the past, retailers hoping to reach a mass audience had limited options and often had to rely on third-party sellers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, Shopify’s technology enables these businesses to take a direct-to-consumer approach. This is a strategy that has gained significant traction since the onset of the pandemic.
Shopify’s exceptional performance during the pandemic resulted in a significant increase in sales, making it challenging to surpass those figures. However, the company’s recent financial results could have been more impressive, causing a drop of more than 70% in its stock price since late 2021. Many investors may have factored in unrealistically high growth rates into Shopify’s valuation, anticipating continued rapid expansion indefinitely.
While Shopify’s future remains promising, its main issue is its valuation. At its current price of $40 per share, the company has an enterprise value of $51.6 billion, or eight times the projected revenue for 2023. In contrast, Amazon valuation is only two times its expected sales this year, and BigCommerce’s (NASDAQ:BIGC) is three times its projected revenue for 2023.
Shopify’s current premium valuation is due to its reputation as a groundbreaking growth stock. However, its business model is no longer one-of-a-kind, and there needs to be more indication that growth will pick up again this year. While Shopify’s prospects remain bright, investors will only hesitate to invest if there is a sudden uptick in development or the company’s valuations drop significantly. Given these uncertainties, they should anticipate Shopify’s stock will remain stagnant and underperform the broader market for at least the following year.
Coinbase (COIN)

Rounding out this list of hyper-growth stocks with incredible upside potential is Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN). The company is prominently known as the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US. Notably, Coinbase has kicked off 2023 positively, posting impressive results. The company surpassed expectations, generating revenue of $605 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This exceeded predictions that it would only bring in $588 million. Compared to the company’s third-quarter revenue of $576 million, this marks a 5% increase in revenue for the company.
Coinbase’s improved revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 can be partly attributed to its increased interest income, which reached $182.2 million. This is a significant increase from the $101.8 million reported in the previous quarter. Most of this growth in interest income is derived from the company’s USDC interest income, totaling $146 million. Coinbase’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, had previously desired to shift the exchange’s revenue sources away from transaction fees to reduce the company’s reliance on favorable market conditions.
Regarding its projections for 2023, Coinbase announced it was ready to handle various transaction revenue situations in the upcoming year, which could involve fluctuations or stability in cryptocurrency market capitalization and asset volatility compared to the levels observed at the end of 2022.

Last week was a terrible, horrible, no-good week for stocks. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) reported surprisingly downbeat guidance, and the Federal Reserve signaled more rate hikes to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now in negative territory for the year so far.
This time, investors aren’t waiting for a turnaround. At InvestorPlace.com, we’ve seen a lightning-speed shift in reader interest toward dividend stocks and “meme” stock moonshots — anything to get away from the mega-cap tech firms that dominated January’s news.
1. Dividend Monsters Are Back in Vogue
It’s been a while since we’ve seen such a rapid shift in investor strategy. (Consider TSLA or crypto in 2021 and 2022, where investors rode their holdings all the way down.) This time around, investors are saying “to hell with Jerome Powell and his interest rates.”
InvestorPlace.com’s most-read stories last week included:
“7 Dividend Yield Monsters Poised to Soar”
“7 Best Dividend Growth Stocks for Long-Term Investors”
And Louis Navellier’s “7 Growth Stocks That Also Pay Monthly Dividends”
The shift is probably because investors are sitting on thinner capital cushions now. 70% of stocks in the S&P 500 lost value in 2022, reducing any capital gains. And investors are now far wiser to the lengths that Fed Chair Jerome Powell will go to tamp down inflation.
Why Does it Matter? These moves show that investors are now faster to dump shares in the face of negative economic news. Not even the “Big 4” tech firms – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) – have been immune. So, if you’re looking to build a position in a long-term, high-quality holding, there’s a good chance that “buying the dip” will be a better strategy than cost-averaging.
2. Animal Spirits Are Returning
On the other end of the spectrum, InvestorPlace.com also is seeing renewed interest in higher-risk bets. On Friday morning, a massive number of expiring Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) options exchanged hands within minutes of the market open. Volumes for Nvidia’s expiring bearish $230 put options exceeded open interest by a 1.5-to-1 ratio, an unusually high figure that smacks of speculation.
Some Tesla options, like its bullish $200 calls, also saw similarly aggressive trading. By lunchtime Friday, volumes exceeded open interest by almost 3x. And no fewer than 45,000 InvestorPlace.com readers have now checked out Thomas Niel’s “Tesla Stock Prediction for 2025” since it published on Feb. 10.
These are all signs of investors “reaching for return,” at least among day traders. Also on Friday morning, for example, shares of Bridger Aerospace Group Holdings (NASDAQ:BAER) – a $350 million market cap aerial firefighting company – jumped 100% at the open on virtually no news.
There’s little doubt that other marginal firms will see similar spikes in the coming weeks. Perhaps it’s time to load up on AMC Entertainment (NYSE:APE) shares as a gamble?
3. Ford Is Giving Up on Rivian
Electric vehicle stock stories also remain popular at the website.
We’ve always known that the relationship between Ford (NYSE:F) and Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) was a marriage of convenience. The legacy automaker needed to show investors it was doing something… anything… to catch up with Tesla and its upcoming Cybertruck. Meanwhile, Rivian needed cold, hard cash to turn its electric vehicle dreams into reality.
It’s a plot worthy of a daytime soap opera.
Still, Ford’s recent success with its electric F-150 truck seems to have gone to its head. Shares fell 10% after the Detroit automaker announced it was selling Rivian, compared to only a 3% decline in the smaller firm.
Why Does it Matter? In one InvestorPlace.com story, we show how the Biden administration has effectively underwritten the electric vehicle industry in its Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 with generous $7,500 tax rebates. And whether you agree with the policy or not, Ford’s and Rivian’s lower stock prices now provide more attractive entry points than where we were seven days ago.
As for InvestorPlace.com readers trying to decide between the two stocks, Luke Lango has some keen words of wisdom.
4. Earnings Season Continues Next Week
A clear pattern has begun to emerge from this earnings season. Retailers have generally disappointed investors with downbeat results, while energy stocks and airlines have asked, “What recession?” Tech has been a mixed bag.
On Friday, British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group (OTCMKTS:ICAGY) announced it was profitable for the first time since the pandemic began. That comes on the heels of an 18% earnings beat from Priceline operator Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG). (As a reminder, several other airlines have now reported record fourth-quarter profits.)
It’s no surprise that diverging fortunes have pushed the VIX Index up 27% since the start of the month. No wonder Larry Ramer’s “7 Comeback Stocks to Buy Before They Soar Again” was a popular read on our site this week.
Why This Matters. Investors looking to establish long-term positions in retail stocks will likely want to wait until after earnings this week. Consumers are getting squeezed by inflation, as executives at Walmart noted, and corporate guidance is coming down. Meanwhile, it’s not too late to buy into energy stocks – a strategy that, as InvestorPlace Digest reader know well, Louis Navellier strongly advocates.
5. Taking ChatGPT for a Spin… With Weird Results
Finally, InvestorPlace.com’s editors decided to ask a burning question this week:
Could ChatGPT do our work for us?
Answer: Well… no. (Although the results were interesting!)
To start, the artificial intelligence-fueled chatbot was surprisingly reluctant to give any answer at all – a product of its carefully crafted guardrails. OpenAI’s bosses clearly don’t want their chatbot masquerading as a registered investment advisor.
But after some goading, ChatGPT was able to provide answers after our writers and I primed the AI with some cleverly crafted questions.
The results looked much like the average piece of internet advice, with growth stock “buy” recommendations ranging from the mostly obvious (META) to the very obvious (AAPL).
Why This Matters. The exercise shows us the clear limitations of today’s AI chatbots. These algorithms take information from publicly available documents (mostly from the internet) and create a rehash of their inputs.
In other words, ChatGPT sounds (and performs) much like the average investor.
Of course, these algorithms will only get better with time. Nevertheless, it could take years for foundation models to become proficient at long-term trading. Human nature, after all, is what powers the stock market.

March 2 (Reuters) - Broadcom Inc AVGO.O forecast second-quarter revenue above estimates on Thursday, as increased investments in artificial intelligence spurs demand for its chips used in data centers.
In a deteriorating economy, where both consumer and enterprise spending is on a decline, AI has emerged as a bright spot for chip firms like Nvidia NVDA.O and Broadcom AVGO.O, thanks to the strong potential applications of the technology as illustrated by OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT.
Broadcom supplies chips used in data centers for networking as well as specialized chips that speed up AI work.
The Apple Inc AAPL.O supplier is also expected to gain from pent up demand for iPhones after Apple grappled with production hurdles in China in the latter half of last year.
Shares of San Jose, California-based Broadcom rose 1.3% in extended trading.
The chip designer expects current-quarter revenue to be about $8.7 billion, while analysts on average expect $8.59 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Revenue for the three-month ended Jan. 29 was $8.92 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $8.90 billion.

As a percentage of NVDA's recent stock price of $232.55, this dividend works out to approximately 0.02%, so look for shares of NVIDIA Corp to trade 0.02% lower — all else being equal — when NVDA shares open for trading on 3/7/23. Similarly, investors should look for LUV to open 0.53% lower in price and for WD to open 0.72% lower, all else being equal.
Below are dividend history charts for NVDA, LUV, and WD, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.
NVIDIA Corp (Symbol: NVDA):
Southwest Airlines Co (Symbol: LUV):
Walker & Dunlop Inc (Symbol: WD):
In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 0.07% for NVIDIA Corp, 2.10% for Southwest Airlines Co, and 2.88% for Walker & Dunlop Inc.
In Friday trading, NVIDIA Corp shares are currently down about 0.2%, Southwest Airlines Co shares are up about 0.8%, and Walker & Dunlop Inc shares are up about 0.5% on the day.

Healthcare AI stocks are on the rise with the introduction of AI-based solutions. These solutions allow companies to improve operations and cut costs using artificial intelligence.
AI technology is being used in many ways in healthcare. It can improve diagnosis, reduce medical errors, and improve patient outcomes. As AI becomes more prevalent in healthcare, we must discuss how this technology can positively impact our lives and society.
In the future, AI can help businesses and individuals make more informed decisions about their health. AI is being used for health care in different ways: data collection, predictive analytics, machine learning, decision support systems, and clinical decision support systems.
The global healthcare business is also seeing massive growth in IT spending, which will help it strategically plan and optimize its work; according to a research report from MarketsandMarkets, the global healthcare IT market is expected to reach $974.5 billion by 2027 from an estimated $394.6 billion in 2022, growing at a CAGR of 19.8% from 2022 to 2027.
As a result, the combination of growing demand for healthcare and the simultaneous rise of AI is creating unique investment opportunities. Healthcare AI stocks are offering a window into this world. And savvy investors understand the situation and are playing this to their advantage.
If you want to do the same, the time to strike is now. Here are four quality healthcare AI stocks for your consideration.

NVDA Nvidia $238.90
GEHC GE Healthcare $76.37
MDT Medtronic $83.41

Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a company that has produced graphics cards for more than 20 years. It is known for its innovations in computer graphics, gaming, and data center.
Nvidia’s latest innovation is artificial intelligence. Nvidia has been working on AI for several years and has released a series of products designed to make AI accessible to businesses and consumers alike.
Nvidia’s first foray into AI was the development of its CUDA platform, which allows developers to use their GPU (graphics processing unit) to create AI software that can run on any device with an Nvidia GPU.
In addition, Nvidia has already significantly impacted the healthcare industry with its use of AI. Nvidia is used only to design processors and graphics cards.
However, it is now creating AI chips for healthcare and supercomputer devices. The change shows that Nvidia recognizes the evolving need for AI in many fields.
Nvidia is also making an impact in healthcare by fostering AI startups. Under the Nvidia Inception umbrella, the tech giant is helping foster more than 13,000 technology startups. Among them are over 1,000 healthcare startups. These healthcare startups will ensure that Nvidia stays ahead of the competition in this fast-growing field.
Finally, Nvidia announced it is collaborating with other cloud service providers to create a method for healthcare companies to use its launch AI sessions. This should be a bonus for healthcare companies that can’t rely on Nvidia’s AI platform.
GE Healthcare (GEHC)
Source: testing / Shutterstock.com
GE Healthcare Technologies (NASDAQ:GEHC) provides medical imaging, diagnostic care, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, healthcare IT solutions, and medical research services.
The global medical technology company began trading on the stock market in January after multinational conglomerate General Electric (NYSE:GE) spun off its division.
GE Healthcare has four segments: imaging, ultrasound, patient care solutions, and pharmaceutical diagnostics.
The company uses artificial intelligence to help its healthcare providers conduct research and make better decisions. Its Edison platform helps the company better understand its customers’ needs and provide appropriate solutions.
Edison uses big data analytics to provide insights into how people use GE Healthcare’s products and how they can improve them. They use this insight to make changes that will lead to better care for patients and greater profits for GE Healthcare.
In January, GE Healthcare presented healthy financial results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2022.
Full-year revenue reached $18.3 billion, up 4% due to growth in its imaging and ultrasound segments. Net income for the company was $1.96 billion, down from $2.2 billion in 2021, but that’s mostly because of planned increased research and development spending, foreign exchange rates, and inflation.
In the fourth quarter, the figures become a lot better. Revenue reached $4.9 billion, up 8% year over year, while net income fell by just 1.7% over the same period in 2021. Notably, cash-flow growth is strong, up $436 million to finish the quarter at $987 million.
GE Healthcare is new to the table, but it is already profitable. And the brand recognition of being under GE’s umbrella will help it sell its software and products more easily, making it one of the top healthcare AI stocks.
Medtronic (MDT)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) is the largest producer of medical devices in the world. It is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and has offices worldwide.
It has been recognized for its innovative products, such as the Medtronic Minimed, the first FDA-approved portable insulin pump.
In recent years, Medtronic has been increasing its investments in AI to help healthcare industries catch up with other sectors.
The intelligent endoscopy module, GI Genius, is used for increased adenoma detection. Recent studies have shown that it can also identify early lesions that progress into colorectal cancers. The only AI system approved for performing colonoscopies is GI Genius.
Medtronic recently posted healthy third-quarter fiscal 2023 financial results, which beat estimates. It reported strong Q3 performance in cardiovascular and neuroscience portfolios, improved cardiac & neurology business results in Diabetes markets outside the US, and enhanced product availability in certain businesses.
In addition, Medtronic bumped up the lower end of its 2023 non-GAAP EPS outlook. It now expects EPS in the range of $5.28 to $5.30 versus previous guidance of $5.25 to $5.30.
Shares of the medical device company have been declining recently. During the last 12 months, their value has dropped by more than 23%. As a result, this one looks very attractive for those looking for attractive valuations among healthcare AI stocks.
Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a company that has been around for decades. It has a history of innovation and is one of the leading companies in the tech industry.
Microsoft is one of the leading companies in the tech industry. Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded it in 1975, and it has a history of innovation. Microsoft is best known for its operating system, Windows, which powers just over 74% of personal computers worldwide.
Although Microsoft is one of the most popular technology companies, it is also one of the most innovative. The software giant is constantly innovating to stay ahead of the competition.
Most recently, investors and analysts have been salivated to invest in Microsoft due to its involvement with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.
Reportedly, the tech giant is investing $10 billion in OpenAI as part of a making a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar” investment in the innovative AI company.
On the healthcare front, Microsoft is actively involved in the healthcare space. Over the past few years, Microsoft and Novartis (NYSE:NVS) partnered for AI-backed drug discovery and development. Microsoft has also partnered with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) to advance AI in healthcare.
In summary, Microsoft is a great investment because it has a wide moat. It is one of the few companies with a strong brand and can protect its position in the market. In addition, a sizeable war chest of over $100 billion in cash reserves gives it tremendous power to pursue its AI ambitions.

Investing in Cathie Wood stocks means directing your money toward innovation. And that means investing heavily in tech, a sector that has been pummeled by interest rates held higher by a Federal Reserve battling runaway inflation. Cathie Wood’s portfolio can be found here and includes hundreds of holdings primarily in tech. 
Wood’s ARK Investment Management includes several actively managed ETFs that focus on high-growth companies in fields such as genomics, robotics, and fintech. ARK’s most popular funds include the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK), ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW), and ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (BATS:ARKG). Of course, any investor seeking to invest in Cathie Wood stocks could simply establish a position in any of those ETFs. That would be a reasonable method for following her investment methods. However, this list consists of individual stock picks all found within ARK’s respective ETFs. 
NVDA Nvidia $234.27
TSLA Tesla $189.67

Most investors know Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a leading semiconductor company that designs and manufactures advanced graphics processing units for gaming, data centers, and artificial intelligence. With all of those central to innovation, it should be no surprise that Nvidia is among ARK’s top holdings. The company’s shares provided investors with handsome returns throughout the pandemic era. Even now Nvidia remains at the forefront of innovation on many fronts. And it’s still garnering recognition for its place in the burgeoning AI realm. In fact, the company anticipates that by 2024, 60% of the 2000 largest enterprises globally will leverage AI across business-critical functions. 
Cathie Wood Stocks: Tesla (TSLA)
Source: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.com
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has a strong history of innovation and disruption in the automotive industry. Better, its shares represent the second largest holding in Wood’s ARK Investment Management, at 6.8%. ARK increased its Tesla holding by 13.3% in Q4. That decision has proven profitable in 2023 as shares have jumped from $108 to $190. Those shares also carry an average target price of $197 which would seem to suggest they are close to fully priced and dissuade some from buying now. 
Even now, Tesla remains a growth machine. Q4 saw the EV pioneer record its highest-ever revenue, operating income, and net income ever. At the same time, things are far from perfect for the company. Automotive gross margins have been on the decline for quite some time, dating back to at least Q1 ‘21. But Tesla remains a growth story worth investing in, delivering 1.31 million vehicles in 2022. Fed rates will continue to introduce volatility into TSLA stock but in the long run, Tesla will prevail. 
Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA)

Intellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NTLA) is part of ARK’s heavy stock investment into a gene editing and genomics industry that it highly favors. The firm specializes in developing gene-editing therapies based on the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The company, and Wood, are betting on the promise of gene-editing technology in treating genetic diseases. Intellia Therapeutics’ focus on developing gene therapies for cancer, rare diseases, and other genetic disorders promises significant growth and returns for those investors. 
2023 has been good to Wood’s signature ARKK Innovation ETF after it declined a massive 67%(1) in 2022. The company’s NTLA stock holding has not been among its losers, instead performing very well. ARK has purchased those shares at an average entry price of $35.13 and they have grown 16% to their current price.  
Intellia Therapeutics recently received FDA clearance for its investigational new drug application related to its NTLA-2002 drug. That drug is a CRISPR-based therapy for the treatment of hereditary angioedema. That treatment inactivates a protein that causes angioedema, which triggers system inflammation in the body’s organ systems.    
Adyen (ADYEY)

The fintech sector is full of stocks like Adyen (OTCMKTS:ADYEY) that promise to innovate the traditional finance industry. The Dutch-based company provides payment processing services to businesses worldwide. Growing demand for digital payments and e-commerce means that the company has a strong runway ahead. Further, its platforms support a range of payment methods and currencies that make it attractive to businesses everywhere.
I wrote about the company a few weeks ago just after it released earnings which saw the company’s revenues grow by 30% during the year to €1.3 billion. Ayden processed a massive €767.5 billion of payments for the entire year, representing 49% growth on a year-over-year basis. Ayden maintains business hubs across major financial hubs globally that include Singapore, Chicago, San Francisco, Madrid, and Sao Paolo. That global presence, combined with the fact that it serves multiple payment methods and currencies should help it to see continued strong growth, making it a strong choice among Wood’s fintech investments. 
Caterpillar (CAT)

Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a well-known heavy equipment, engine, and financial services company. It’s also a widely-held, well-known defensive stock broadly mimicking global economic growth. Wood’s ARK holds its because of the company’s strategic focus on digital transformation and innovation. CAT stock has shown impressive growth since the onset of the pandemic when prices fell to $92. Those prices currently stand at $252. However, Caterpillar’s prospects broadly mimic those of the global economy. So it should come as no surprise that share prices have run sideways since mid-2021. 
Caterpillar continues to grow with top-line results that improved by 20% when it released earnings in late January. The company was able to pass higher prices on to buyers which led to $1.74 billion in sales during the most recent quarter. Like all firms with a significant overseas presence, the strong U.S. dollar muted gains as profits were remunerated to its U.S. headquarters. 
CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP)
Source: Natali_ Mis/ShutterStock.com
CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) is a pioneering biotechnology company in the development of gene-editing therapies based on the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The transformative potential of gene-editing technology in treating genetic diseases has raised its stock and intrigued Wood’s ARK as well. 
Crispr Therapeutics is something of an anomaly in the sense that it is fundamentally similar to many biotech upstarts but is actually well-established. The stock’s fortunes move more with narratives about its pipeline than its fundamentals. It reported no material revenues for all of 2022. In general, it depends on collaboration revenues for its top-line performance. In 2021, such collaborations resulted in $913.1 in revenues. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) was responsible for $900 million of that total upon the successful co-development of CTX001. That’s part of the allure of CRSP stock: Its technology is leveraged by other therapeutics firms that in turn pay for the lion’s share of development while Crispr reaps outsized rewards. 
Magna International (MGA)

Magna International (NYSE:MGA) is a global automotive supplier that designs, develops, and manufactures a range of products. Its stock is a beneficiary of the EV boom, particularly the surge of SPACs that took EV firms public. Magna International is responsible for the production of Fisker’s (NYSE:FSR) Ocean SUV. So it’s easy to see why Wood was attracted to the firm’s connection to innovation within the sector.  
The Ocean SUV is Fisker’s flagship EV after going public. The company chose to outsource production and in doing so likely saved itself. Many other EV SPACs overextended themselves by building manufacturing from the ground up while also marketing yet-to-be-produced EVs at the same time. And several of them are far behind Fisker currently. But by collaborating with Magna International Fisker was able to begin production on Nov. 17, as initially promised. That could lead to future contract manufacturing opportunities for Magna International. The company also picked up Veoneer’s active safety arm giving its business active driver assistance systems (ADAS) offerings that strengthen its vehicle innovation presence.

Artificial intelligence is a multitrillion-dollar opportunity in the making. According to Grand View Research, the global AI boom could grow from about $137 billion in 2022 to more than $1.81 trillion by 2030. Morgan Stanley says AI is creating a potential $6 trillion opportunity for the tech industry. Bank of America says we’re on the brink of an iPhone moment with a potential $15 trillion impact. Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management says AI could increase the productivity of workers, leading to economic output of $200 trillion.
In short, the AI story could get big, fast. Here are three of the top high-growth AI stocks to buy.
C3.ai (AI)
Source: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky
AI could soon be a $600 billion addressable software market, says C3.ai (NYSE:AI) CEO Tom Siebel, as noted by Yahoo Finance. “Everyone will be using enterprise AI applications, just like they use PCs, just like they use relational databases, just like we use CRM. Generative AI definitely accelerated the interest in AI. So, AI is now at a peak, and that seems to work very well for C3.ai because I think we’re the largest application player in that space.”
Better, the company is making money by developing AI solutions and software for companies in several industries. That includes manufacturing, oil and gas, utilities, financial services, government, and more. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), for example, partnered with C3.ai to boost cloud services.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Next up on the list of artificial intelligence stocks to own is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a pioneering force behind AI. This is the company that provides the processing power needed to run AI applications. With that, it could see significant revenue.
Cowen agrees, reiterating an “outperform” rating on the stock with a price target of $220. “Nvidia is the leader in accelerated compute and the key enabler for AI across vertical industries – full stop,” said the firm, as quoted by Barron’s. Raymond James also likes NVDA, rating the stock a “strong buy.” Cowen analysts noted NVDA is a key enabler for AI across vertical industries.
Better, according to Credit Suisse, NVDA is the “leading silicon AI enabler.” “Nvidia’s software will be its ‘competitive moat’ in AI that keeps other companies at bay.”
The firm has a current price target of $275 on NVDA stock.
Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ)

If you are on the hunt for high-growth AI stocks, you can always diversify with an exchange-traded fund, such as the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ:BOTZ). With an expense ratio of 0.68%, or $68 on an initial $10,000 investment, the ETF invests in companies that stand to benefit from increased adoption and utilization of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI).
This includes those involved with industrial robotics and automation, non-industrial robots, and autonomous vehicles, according to Global X. Some of its top holdings include Nvidia, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), SMC Corporation (OTCMKTS:SMCAY), iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT) and Accuray (NASDAQ:ARAY).

The investing environment has really changed in recently. We went from a market that was enjoying a strong uptrend to enduring a small pullback and then to genuine concerns about regional banks and higher interest rates. Despite these challenges, it still has investors looking for the best short-term stocks to buy.
When we’re looking for the best short-term stocks to buy, we want companies that have had bullish reactions to their earnings reports. We also want to see a trend of higher lows and higher highs on the chart, showing a stronger bullish technical setup.
Many of these names have been in tech — a target among bears in 2022. So far in 2023 though, these stocks have been trading much, much better.
If the selling pressure really picks up, these names will likely be in trouble. Still, let’s look at a few stocks that are setting up nicely on the long side this month.
CRM Salesforce $173.18
NVDA Nvidia $229.65
DKS Dick’s Sporting Goods $146.27
Salesforce (CRM)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has been enjoying a strong rally off its December low. Coming into earnings, shares were up 32%. At the recent high, the stock was up almost 42%. None of that matters though, as shares ripped higher on earnings.
The stock jumped 11.5% after Salesforce delivered better-than-expected earnings and revenue expectations. Revenue grew more than 14% year over year and the company’s operating cash flow was robust.
Even better, Salesforce guided for better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and above-consensus earnings and revenue estimates for the full year.
That type of fundamental improvement has a tendency to drive a stronger technical situation, which is exactly what we have with Salesforce stock. If the stock can’t hold current support, we could see a gap-fill down to the $168 area and potentially a dip to the low-$160s.
However, it may be worth taking a shot on this one, particularly if the overall market can find its footing.
 Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has not had the easiest run. As a large-cap growth stock, short-sellers and bears gunned for this name amid the raid on growth stocks.
It didn’t help that sagging demand and lower orders were hindering Nvidia’s guidance and quarterly reports.
Last quarter, sales sank 20% year over year to $6.05 billion, but topped expectations by $30 million. Not exactly robust, but it helped that earnings beat analysts’ expectations too. It helped considerably that guidance for the first quarter topped consensus estimates.
I admittedly am a long-term bull on Nvidia and I also admit this quarter was not exactly a blowout result. Instead, it was better-than-feared, but I’m not one to fight the trend. Nvidia stock continues to hold up well, still up more than 100% from the low.
Until some of these trends break, the stock is firmly in the buy-the-dip camp, although it would be a juicy buy after a harrowing decline should the market get dicey here.
Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Last but not least, we’re going to the retail sector with Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS). This is considerably smaller than the previous two companies, with a market cap of roughly $12.5 billion.
Size hasn’t been a deterrent though, with the stock recently notching new all-time highs. Shares rallied 11% after reporting earnings on March 7 and the subsequent rally carried it to new highs.
The retailer delivered a top- and bottom-line beat, full-year earnings guidance that topped analysts’ expectations and more than doubled its quarterly dividend to $1.00 a share. That gives the stock a yield of roughly 3% while trading around 10.5 times this year’s earnings outlook.
That is very impressive, given the bumpy situation with consumers. Given the strength in the stock and the recent weakness in the overall market, the situation with Dick’s can go one of two ways.
Either investors sell the stock to lock in profit or it becomes a hide-out spot for investors looking for a combination of strong fundamentals and technicals.
Until proven otherwise, this stock is also a buy-the-dip candidate for now.

2023-03-15 00:00:00+00:00,Is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) a Top Bet as ChatGPT Goes Viral?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-nvidia-nasdaq%3Anvda-a-top-bet-as-chatgpt-goes-viral,"OpenAI’s ChatGPT quickly gained popularity after its November 2022 launch. The AI (Artificial Intelligence)-powered chatbot has seen rapid adoption while its use case is growing. Given its popularity, top tech giants, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG), have poured in billions to capitalize on the viral trend. However, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has become a top investment for investors. 
But before digging deeper into NVDA, it’s important to highlight that ChatGPT is now more powerful and predictable as the company launches a new version of this viral chatbot. Thanks to the latest version, the viral chatbot can now analyze images and handle much larger blocks of text. 
According to a Wall Street Journal report, Martin Casado, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm, said that ChatGPT-like generative AI tech could significantly cut the costs of producing text, images, and other creative projects. This implies that ChatGPT-like technology will likely witness solid demand in the coming years, providing a solid investment opportunity for investors. 
Nvidia Leads the Race
While tech giants are investing billions in introducing AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT, Nvidia, with its AI chips, has already taken the lead. Its CEO, Jensen Huang, highlighted during the Q4 conference call that the adoption of AI is at an inflection point, and NVDA has emerged as “the operating system of AI systems today.” It’s worth highlighting that the AI computing infrastructure is concentrated with Nvidia.
With the increased number of firms planning to incorporate ChatGPT-like tools into their businesses, NVDA is poised to deliver stellar financial results and benefit from solid demand. 
Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna sees ChatGPT as a tailwind for NVDA and expects the company to outperform peers owing to the AI momentum. 
What’s the Prediction for NVDA Stock?
NVDA stock has received 24 Buy, six Hold, and two Sell recommendations for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. It has rallied about 65% year-to-date. Meanwhile, analysts’ average price target of $256.59 implies 6.63% upside potential.
Bottom Line 
The broad adoption of AI and Nvidia’s strong competitive positioning in the AI space bode well for growth. However, macro uncertainty and weak demand for general-purpose CPU infrastructure could restrict NVDA’s growth in the short term.

2023-03-16 00:00:00+00:00,3 Breakout Stocks to Buy Before They Skyrocket,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-breakout-stocks-to-buy-before-they-skyrocket,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It’s not all bad out there. While bank failures and ongoing market volatility generate headlines, there are several stocks that have staged huge rallies to start the year. Many technology stocks that were badly beaten up in 2022 have gained more than 50% since the start of this year. While worries persist about inflation and the likelihood that interest rates will continue rising over the near-term, investors have been quietly piling into certain securities, leading to isolated breakouts that could result in some share prices skyrocketing in the coming weeks and months. To be sure, risks remain. But investors who know where to look can make money in the market right now. Here are three breakout stocks to buy before they skyrocket.
NVDA Nvidia $258
META Meta $199
AMZN Amazon $98.55
Nvidia (NVDA)

So far in 2023, the share price of semiconductor and microchip company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has gained 77%. Considering that we’re only ten weeks into the year, that is an astounding gain in a relatively short period of time. Looking behind us, it appears that NVDA stock bottomed at $108 a share last October. Since then, the share price has more than doubled. And momentum seems to be gathering behind the chipmaker as its stock has gained 10% in the last month alone.
The breakout appears to have been fueled by several factors. Sentiment towards technology stocks has been improving after a brutal selloff through much of last year. Nvidia gave investors and analysts reasons for optimism with a fourth-quarter earnings print, delivered at the end of February, that beat expectations.
And Nvidia’s high-powered chips are seen as a key component needed to advance artificial intelligence and the chatbots that are transfixing the investment community. All this signals that NVDA stock is likely to continue rising.
Meta Platforms (META)

Facebook’s parent company, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), is another tech stock that is breaking out after a tough downturn in 2022. In 2023, META stock has risen 58%, including a 14% gain over the past month. The share price is on the cusp of breaking above $200 and a new 52-week high looks within reach. Sentiment towards the company run by Mark Zuckerberg has improved dramatically from just a few months ago when analysts were disparaging the billions of dollars being allocated to the development of the metaverse.
Zuckerberg and his company have managed to win back analysts and investors by undertaking aggressive cost-cutting measures that have included laying off more than 20,000 employees. Zuckerberg has called 2023 Meta’s “year of efficiency,” which is winning applause along Wall Street.
On February 1, Meta Platforms also announced a $40 billion stock buyback program, which has also helped lift the share price. And, META stock is benefitting from threats by President Joe Biden to ban Chinese social media app TikTok, which is a key competitor of Meta Platforms.
Amazon (AMZN)

Many professional analysts and traders on Wall Street are rooting for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently named Amazon a “top pick” for the remainder of 2023. And JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) just reaffirmed its “overweight” (buy) rating on AMZN stock.
These firms believe that Amazon’s stock has been oversold and that its CEO, Andy Jassy, is righting the ship after announcing 18,000 job cuts and hitting pause on several infrastructure projects, including a second headquarters in Virginia.
While AMZN stock has not rallied as strongly as NVDA or META  this year, there are signs of life at the e-commerce company. Amazon’s share price has risen 7% since the beginning of March and is now close to breaking above $100 a share for the first time since the start of February.
Amazon has also benefitted from a rotation out of bank stocks following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, and growing expectations that the Federal Reserve may now need to slow its pace of interest-rate increases.

2023-03-17 00:00:00+00:00,Better Growth Stock: Nvidia vs. Apple,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-growth-stock%3A-nvidia-vs.-apple-0,"Tech stocks fell out of favor in 2022, which led the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index to plummet 40% throughout the year. Steep rises in the cost of living led to declines in demand for consumer technology and reductions in earnings for many companies. However, 2023 has Wall Street optimistic about the market again, with the index up roughly 19% year to date.
As a result of this optimism (and other positive catalysts unique to each specific company), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares have risen 75% and 20% since Jan. 1. These companies experienced substantial stock declines last year yet remain compelling long-term investments, thanks to their history of immense growth.
So, is Nvidia or Apple the better growth stock? Let's take a closer look.
Nvidia's AI catalyst supports longer-term growth
After suffering a stock price fall of 50% last year, Nvidia's monster growth since the start of 2023 has investors' heads spinning. The swift recovery has highlighted the importance of holding growth stocks through temporary market sell-offs, as those who sold last year would not have benefited from the recent rally.
Nvidia shares have climbed 307% in the last five years and roughly 8,000% over the last 10 years, solidifying it as one of the best growth stocks available. The company has primarily profited from the expansion of the consumer graphics processing unit (GPU) market over the years, which has seen more and more people build custom PCs for activities such as video editing and gaming.
Nvidia has amassed an 88% market share in desktop GPUs. The majority market share was the company's detriment in 2022, with GPU shipments sinking 42% worldwide. However, its dominance in the industry has also given it the power and financial resources to become a prominent player in artificial intelligence (AI), a market that also heavily utilizes GPUs.
Nvidia is the primary supplier of GPUs to OpenAI's ChatGPT, an advanced AI chatbot capable of producing human-like dialogue. According to research from TrendForce, the software used about 20,000 GPUs in 2020, with that figure expected to hit 30,000 soon as ChatGPT prepares for commercialization.
As AI competition ramps up, more companies could soon turn to Nvidia for its GPUs, making its stock a no-brainer buy right now, especially alongside a history of consistent growth.
Expect Apple's dominance to continue
With the highest market cap in the world at $2.45 trillion, Apple's stock has long had a reputation as a reliable and solid growth stock. The company's shares have risen 250% in the last five years and 884% in the last decade. Meanwhile, its annual revenue has increased by 48% to $394.33 billion since 2018, with operating income soaring 68% to $119.44 billion.
Apple truly proved its resilience in 2022 by being one of the only companies among big tech to outperform the market, illustrated in the chart below.
Data by YCharts
Apple's immensely popular products and services remained in demand in fiscal 2022, with revenue rising 8% year over year to $394.3 billion and operating income climbing 9.6% to $119.4 billion. The company's stability is mainly thanks to the wide adoption of its iPhones and services, which combined were responsible for 72% of Apple's revenue last year.
In September 2022, the iPhone overtook Alphabet's Android for most smartphone market share, hitting 50%. The majority market share will likely prove a lucrative asset for Apple to attract more consumers to its other products and services in the future. Meanwhile, Apple's services segment reported revenue growth double the iPhone in 2022 at 14%, earning $78.1 billion with a profit margin of 71.7%. Comparatively, products' profit margin came in at 36.3%. As a result, Apple's diversification with solid positions in hardware and digital services strengthens its long-term outlook.
Apple stock is the winner
Apple's year-to-date stock rise of 20% may not be as impressive as Nvidia's 75%. However, the more gradual rise suggests the iPhone company's stock is less volatile. Additionally, Apple's performance amid economic challenges in 2022 makes its stock feel less of a risk, no matter the climate of the market.
Nvidia and Apple are both great long-term investments, likely to offer substantial gains for years thanks to their solid roles in high-profit markets. But if you can only choose one, Apple is the better and more reliable growth stock right now.

                Podcast@Zacks.com
  Welcome to Episode #353 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.
Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.
This week, Tracey is going solo to discuss the semiconductor stocks. After a terrible 2022, the semiconductors stocks have rallied in 2023. The iShares Semiconductor ETF is up 23% year-to-date while the S&P 500 has only gained 3.6%.
Are the Semis Sending a Bullish Signal?
On Mar 20, 2023, Carson Group’s Chief Market Strategist, Ryan Detrick, tweeted out about how the semis made a “new 52-week relative strength high” versus the S&P 500. Detrick noted in the tweet that such an event wasn’t normally consistent with a recession.
Is the semiconductor rally of 2023 signaling that there will NOT be a recession this year? Is the economy stronger than many realize?
And if not, should investors be buying the semiconductors?
5 Big Cap Semiconductor Stocks
1.      NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)
NVIDIA is the semiconductor company on everyone’s lips in 2023 due to its focus on gaming and AI. After selling off in 2022, shares of NVIDIA have rallied 76% year-to-date.
Earnings are expected to jump 34.1% in fiscal 2024 and another 33% in fiscal 2025.
But investors won’t get NVIDIA shares cheaply on a P/E basis. It trades with a forward P/E of 57.8.
Should investors disregard valuation and own NVIDIA for its growth anyway?
2.      Broadcom (AVGO)
Broadcom is also up in 2023, gaining 13.8% year-to-date. Analysts are bullish on Broadcom, with 12 estimates up for fiscal 2023 in the last month. Earnings are expected to rise 9.9% this year.
Shares of Broadcom are also still cheap, with a forward P/E of just 15.6. Additionally, many income investors are fans, as Broadcom pays a dividend currently yielding 2.9%.
Should Broadcom be on your short list due to its attractive valuation?
3.      Texas Instruments (TXN)
Texas Instruments is the third largest position in the iShares Semiconductor ETF. Shares of Texas Instruments are also up in 2023, gaining 7.2%.
But earnings are expected to fall 19.8% this year to $7.53 from $9.39 last year. It’s not that cheap, with a forward P/E of 23.8.
Is Texas Instruments a value trap?
4.      Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)
Advanced Micro Devices has soared 46.5% in 2023. But it’s a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) as 14 earnings estimates have been cut in the last 2 months for 2023, including one in the last week.
Earnings are expected to fall 14% in 2023 to $3.01 from $3.50. Advanced Micro Devices is also not a cheap stock, with a forward P/E of 32.2.
Is Wall Street looking past Advance Micro Device’s falling earnings estimates for this year?
5.      QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM)
QUALCOMM shares are also up in 2023, gaining 11.8% year-to-date. But analysts are bearish on it, as earnings are expected to fall 24.1% in fiscal 2023. The Zacks Consensus is calling for $9.51 from the $12.53 it made last year.
QUALCOMM, however, is still cheap. It has a forward P/E of just 12.8. QUALCOMM also pays a dividend, currently yielding 2.5%.
Should investors be keeping QUALCOMM on its short list?

2023-03-27 00:00:00+00:00,Price & Volume: The Anatomy of a True Market Leader,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/price-volume%3A-the-anatomy-of-a-true-market-leader,"Price & Volume are Key Elements
Studies show that as much as 60% of the human body is comprised of hydrogen and oxygen (water). Said another way, without water, humans cannot survive very long. In the stock market, the elements that comprise a true market leader are strong price and volume trends. Without these two critical ingredients, a stock is unlikely to trend higher.
Monitoring price and volume (or supply and demand) is vital for an investor because it can provide valuable insights into the behavior of the general market and individual equities, such as clues of:
·      Institutional Accumulation: When a stock shoots higher on expanding price and volume, it can be a clue that an institution is accumulating a position. For example, after its last earnings report, Nvidia (NVDA) gapped higher by 14% on volume 129% above the norm.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Nvidia traded a mind-blowing 111 million shares in the session. Because such a large number of shares is impossible for retail investors to buy, the demand was indicative of institutional investors like mutual funds, banks, and pension funds. Remember, institutions move stocks, not retail.
·      A Strong Pullback: As any experienced investor knows, no stock goes straight up. For this reason, investors can gain valuable information by monitoring how a stock pulls back. Shallow pullbacks on low volume are a sign of digestion, not downward conviction. Often, the strength of a stock is revealed in the pullback, not the advance. See Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) below:

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
·      Weak Rallies: When a stock moves higher on low volume, it should raise cautionary flags for investors. Rallies like this signify that while the stock is moving higher, conviction is low. A good recent example is Walker Dunlop (WD).

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Takeaway
Similar to how a doctor consoles an X-Ray for pertinent information, investors look to price and volume charts to reveal important patterns. Charts help investors to identify institutional accumulation from low conviction accumulation. Furthermore, they allow investors to separate strong pullbacks from weak ones. As the old saying goes, “a picture is worth a thousand words.”

2023-03-28 00:00:00+00:00,The 3 Best Growth Stocks to Buy in the Artificial Intelligence Sector,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-3-best-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-the-artificial-intelligence-sector,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
There is a lot of buzz today around artificial intelligence, or AI, and how it is taking over our lives. Created through machine learning, it is about training a system with ample data to make inferences about all the new data. AI has been around for a few years but since the start of 2023, it seems like it is everywhere. With the need for advanced technology growing, AI has already become a main driver across industries, from robotics to Big Data and the internet of things. It has started to transform the software development space and is going to be huge this year. However, the market is still in the early stages of AI adoption and smart investors know that AI growth stocks are where the potential lies.
There are many artificial intelligence stocks on the market, but only a few have the potential to make it big. If you want to tap into the future of AI, consider pure-play AI stocks for your portfolio. Growing interest and an investment surge in AI makes it an ideal time to take your position. Let’s take a look at the best AI growth stocks to add to your portfolio:
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com
One of the first companies that comes to mind when we think of the best AI growth stocks is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Already a solid player in the industry, Microsoft was recently in the news for increasing its stake in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. The revolutionary tool has shown how far AI can go and how capable it is in generating images, texts, ideas, and sounds. This year, Microsoft made a $10 billion investment, a sizeable increase from its previous investment of $1 billion in 2019.
Microsoft recently added “AI-generated stories” to its Bing search engine to give users a better insight into AI. MSFT stock is trading at $280, up 18% in the past six months, and is inching closer to the 52-week high of $315, making it one of the best artificial intelligence stocks to own today. AI justifies its higher valuation and I believe the company’s investments will pay off in the near term. 
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sees AI as the next big computing platform and this investment is just step one in the company’s AI transition. Apart from this investment, the company is harnessing the power of AI in multiple ways, including clinical documentation and healthcare. 
This month, Microsoft also introduced Dynamics 365 Copilot, a tool designed to assist with many businesses’ day-to-day tasks including marketing, sales, and customer service. The technology is still being tested but, if successful, could transform the current automated chat experience. Microsoft is a proven performer, no matter the state of the tech industry, making it a stock to buy and hold onto.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Another artificial intelligence stock to watch out for is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). A leader in the graphics chip industry, it is making the most of the AI boom and could become one of the biggest players in the world. Its data center segment has shown a steady rise in the share of the total revenue of the company and managed to top the gaming segment in revenue last year. Despite the drop in tech stocks and the market turmoil, NVDA stock was standing strong because AI was one of the driving forces behind its growth. 
The stock is currently trading at $265 and is up more than 100% in the past six months. Nvidia recently launched a set of inference platforms designed for generative AI and its chips are already popular for handling large workloads. Because it has applications that are required to run AI apps, Nvidia should remain in demand and relevant in the upcoming years.
In the upcoming years, Nvidia intends to make self-driving car processors another revenue stream. Since cars with self-driving capabilities gather ample amounts of data from cameras and sensors in real-time, AI is then used to make complex decisions — something Nvidia intends to start contributing to in the next few years. NVDA stock does not come cheap and it is currently trading at 24.8 times sales, but the growth potential is massive.
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)
Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, is another top artificial intelligence stock to buy for long-term growth. It recently acquired Alter, an AI avatar startup that allows creators and brands to express their virtual identities, for $100 million. In order to get an edge in the AI sector, companies need to make ongoing investments and Alphabet has the liquidity to do so. It also has the experience and resources to make a mark in the AI industry.
The company’s recent history is not without setbacks. Between the partnership of Microsoft with OpenAI and their ChatGPT tool, as well as the relatively unsuccessful launch of Google’s own AI-equipped service, Bard, GOOG stock has taken hits in recent months. However, the company has many years of experience in deep learning and it can help with a smooth transition into AI.
GOOGL stock is on sale currently which is also another reason to buy. The stock is trading at $105 today and is down 25% in the past year. Considering its history and growth potential, it is cheap for the tech sector.

2023-03-29 00:00:00+00:00,Pre-Markets in Green Ahead of Final Trading Days of March,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pre-markets-in-green-ahead-of-final-trading-days-of-march,"As we approach the final trading days of the month and Q1, we see this Hump Day morning’s pre-market futures in the green across the board of major indices. We’re also up over the past five trading days, after a rough start following the latest Fed meeting. The Dow is +210 points at this hour, the S&P 500 +30, the Nasdaq +100 points and the small-cap Russell 2000 +15 points.
Prominent bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach predicted a pending recession in the coming months yesterday, based mostly on the tightening yield curve inversion between 2-year and 10-year bonds. Komal Sri-Kumar suggests a major credit event may be in the offing, which now increases the odds for a “hard landing” into an economic recession in the U.S. this year. Even though we are near the end of interest rate tightening, many see the ticking clock starting the moment the Fed stops raising rates (perhaps as soon as May’s meeting).
So with doom and gloom being forecast, why are market participants keeping so positive? After all, even though we’re climbing up from fairly harsh lows in 2022, we’ve already seen some stupendous gains year to date, including NVIDIA (NVDA) +83%, Meta (META) +68% and Tesla (TSLA) +56%. Is this a disconnect, a willful ignorance and/or another opportunity for market bears to slap down optimists as we saw half a dozen times last year?
The figures on the ground tell the tale of a stolid, well-organized domestic economy, with inventories approaching equilibrium after years of disruption, structural developments in A.I. technology and China’s economy re-joining the rest of the world’s leading economies in a post-pandemic period. Perhaps flashing signals for a recession do exist, but the data is not there yet. It’s for this same reason the Fed may not be finished raising interest rates, no matter what bond traders like Gundlach say about pending doom in the economy.
Meanwhile, we’ll let other data points have their say: Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) are out Friday, and a new Employment Situation is due a week from Friday. These numbers precede Q1 earnings season, which begin in earnest the following week. So while we can speculate til the cows come home on a day like today, the proof will (eventually) be in the pudding.

2023-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,"2 Growth Stocks That Turned $20,000 Into $1 Million In the Last Decade",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-growth-stocks-that-turned-%2420000-into-%241-million-in-the-last-decade,"A few big winners can turn a mediocre portfolio into a monster portfolio. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are proof of that. Shares of Nvidia soared 8,250% over the past decade, meaning an initial investment of $20,000 would now be worth $1.7 million. Similarly, shares of Tesla climbed 7,340% over the past decade, turning an initial investment of $20,000 into nearly $1.5 million.
Are these growth stocks still worth buying?
1. Nvidia
Semiconductor company Nvidia stumbled last year as high inflation reduced demand for its gaming and data center chips. Revenue remained flat at $27 billion and free cash flow fell 53% to $3.8 billion. Unfortunately, management expects current quarter revenue to decline 22% as economic headwinds continue to suppress demand, though guidance implies operating expenses will also fall sharply.
However, Nvidia should find it easy to reaccelerate growth when economic conditions improve. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for rendering realistic visual effects in video games and films, and for accelerating complex data center workloads like scientific computing and artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, Nvidia GPUs hold more than 90% market share in workstation graphics and supercomputer accelerators.
The company has recently branched into cloud software and services. Omniverse Cloud is a 3D design platform for metaverse applications. DGX Cloud provides on-demand access to Nvidia AI infrastructure, and it includes frameworks that accelerate AI application development in areas like retail, logistics, and healthcare. Nvidia also provides generative AI services for text, images, and video. For instance, investment company Morningstar uses the Nvidia NeMo model to scan and summarize financial documents.
Those cloud services build on the brand authority Nvidia has cultivated as a chipmaker, and they create new revenue streams that offer more regular cash flow and higher margins than the sale of cyclical hardware products. Management values its addressable market at $1 trillion, and Nvidia should benefit greatly as technologies like the metaverse and AI continue to evolve.
Currently, shares trade at 24.4 times sales, above the three-year average of 20.7 times sales. That valuation is far from cheap, but Nvidia is the heart of the burgeoning AI industry, so investors should still consider buying a small position in this growth stock today.
2. Tesla
Tesla faced an onslaught of headwinds last year. Supply chain problems and factory closures hindered production, while high inflation and rising interest rates hammered sales across the auto industry. Tesla managed to grow deliveries 40% to 1.3 million vehicles, but that figure fell short of its medium-term guidance calling for 50% annual growth. Fourth-quarter deliveries also fell short of the Wall Street consensus by a wide margin.
Some analysts have explained that shortfall as a demand problem, but management brushed those concerns aside during the latest earnings call. CEO Elon Musk said the company was receiving orders at nearly twice the rate of production. Better yet, despite encountering a number of roadblocks throughout the year, Tesla reported impressive financial results. Revenue increased 51% to $81.5 billion, and GAAP net income soared 122% to $3.62 per diluted share. Tesla also led the industry with 18.2% market share in battery electric vehicles.
Additionally, the company achieved an operating margin of 16.8% last year, the highest among any volume carmaker. Musk attributes that accomplishment to manufacturing prowess, noting that Tesla has the most advanced manufacturing technology on the planet. Better yet, there are several reasons to believe the company will become more profitable in the future.
Tesla should see its logistics costs fall as production ramps at Gigafactory Berlin, its first European factory, simply because the company can now produce cars locally in that market. Tesla is also scaling production of its 4680 battery cell, a technology that promises to reinforce its cost leadership in battery pack production. The company can already produce battery packs (the most expensive part of an electric car) at a lower cost per kilowatt-hour than any other carmaker, but management says the 4680 cell will eventually cut costs by 56%.
Finally, Tesla sees significant margin upside from its full self-driving (FSD) software. A beta version of the product was released to customers in North America last year, and Tesla plans to take the next step toward autonomous ride hailing by mass-producing a robotaxi next year. Ultimately, management believes FSD technology will be the company's most important source of profitability.
Tesla sits in front of a sizable market opportunity. Global electric car sales are expected to grow at 23% annually to hit $1.1 trillion by 2030, according to Precedence Research. And the autonomous vehicles market is expected to grow at 40% annually to reach $2.1 trillion by 2030, according to Research and Markets. As the current leader in battery electric vehicles and one of the leading AI companies (according to Musk), Tesla is set to benefit from both tailwinds. The stock currently trades at 8 times sales, a very rich valuation for a carmaker.
Investors must decide whether Tesla is a carmaker that dabbles in AI, or an AI company that makes cars. Those who find the second description more accurate should consider buying a few shares of this growth stock today. If Tesla does indeed disrupt the mobility industry with robotaxis, its revenue (and margins) could grow quickly and the current valuation multiple could fall in a hurry.

2023-04-05 00:00:00+00:00,2 Stocks That Outperformed the S&P During the Great Recession (and 2 That Bombed),NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-stocks-that-outperformed-the-sp-during-the-great-recession-and-2-that-bombed,"The Great Recession took place over a decade ago and was a tumultuous time for investors who suffered significant losses. Some stocks even performed much worse than the S&P 500 while others proved to be resilient during this stretch.
Below, I'll look at a couple of stocks that outperformed the market and a couple that crashed. Are any of them safe options to invest in right now, with a possible recession looming later this year?
Walmart -- up by 10%
Walmart (NYSE: WMT) performed the best of the stocks on this list during the Great Recession as its share price was up around 10% during that time frame. Despite the downturn in the economy, the business showed solid growth.
For its fiscal year that ended on Jan. 31, 2009, Walmart's sales totaled $401 billion and rose an impressive 7.2%. There were increases in Sam's Club, its international segment, and Walmart U.S. The company was coming off a record-setting performance in the quarter as its operations were proving to be resilient.
Fast forward to today, and the business remains solid. In its most recent fiscal year (ended Jan. 31, 2023), sales of $611.3 billion were up 6.7%. If you exclude divestitures, the growth rate would be up around 7.4%.
Walmart has been a steadily growing business over the years and could continue to be a relatively safe place to invest your money if the economy falls into another recession.
Walgreens Boots Alliance -- down by 25%
Retail pharmacy Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) can provide a relatively stable investment during a downturn because consumers rely on its stores day in and day out. Whether it's to buy pharmaceuticals or day-to-day essentials, the company's stores are conveniently located within five miles of most of the U.S. population. During the early stages of the pandemic, it was also an easy place to obtain a vaccine.
During the Great Recession, the stock's losses were around 25%. While that's not great, it's still better than the S&P 500's losses of close to 40%.
For the year ended Aug. 31, 2009, the company reported record revenue of $63.3 billion, which grew at a rate of 7.3% from the previous year. Prescription sales were a big part of that result, rising by 9% for the final quarter of the year and accounting for two-thirds of the company's top line.
Since then, however, the business has changed as Walgreens acquired European pharmacy chain Alliance Boots and more recently has been pivoting to healthcare. The latter move makes it a particularly riskier business to invest in as Walgreens is devoting more cash and resources to expansion.
While the healthcare stock outperformed the market during the Great Recession, there's no guarantee it will be able to do so if there's another recession in the near future.
Williams-Sonoma -- down by 60%
Specialty retailer Williams-Sonoma (NYSE: WSM) is susceptible to downturns in the economy as its business success is more dependent on discretionary spending. While Walmart and Walgreens may provide consumers with essentials, those same consumers aren't as likely to spend money on high-quality products at Pottery Barn in tougher times.
In the fiscal year ended Feb. 1, 2009, amid the recession, the company's net revenue of $3.4 billion was down 15% from the previous year. And even a year later, sales would fall another 8% to just over $3.1 billion.
During challenging economic periods, Williams-Sonoma can be a risky stock to hold. In the long run, however, given the stock's low valuation, it could result in good profits if you're willing to buy and hold.
Nvidia -- down by 68%
The worst performance on this list belongs to chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). As with high-end products, technology is another area where businesses can often scale back on spending or delay it outright for the sake of keeping costs down.
Nvidia's sales for the year ended Jan. 25, 2009 totaled $3.4 billion and were down 16% from 2008. And a year later, sales would fall again to $3.3 billion as Nvidia noted declining demand in its professional solutions business, saying that there was a ""slow recovery of corporate spending following the economic recession that began during fiscal year 2009.""
Nvidia's business is bigger now, and the growing need for computer chips ensures that this can be a solid growth stock to own for the long haul. But investors should brace themselves for the possibility of a bumpy ride in the next year or two if a recession takes place.

2023-04-06 00:00:00+00:00,Alphabet Says Google's Latest AI Chip is 1.7 Times Faster Than Nvidia. There's a Catch.,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alphabet-says-googles-latest-ai-chip-is-1.7-times-faster-than-nvidia.-theres-a-catch.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is all the rage lately. Human-like interactions from the latest generation of chatbots -- powered by generative AI systems -- has peaked public interest. Microsoft raised eyebrows when it confirmed a $10 billion investment in ChatGPT-creator OpenAI and its plans to integrate the system with its Bing search engine. Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google helped fueled the fervor with the debut of its own chatbot, Bard.
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has long been the gold standard semiconductor used for training AI systems, but being No. 1 invites and even encourages competition, as rivals are always looking to topple the leader.
Now Google is claiming to have wrested the title from Nvidia, but things are a bit more complicated.
Image source: Getty Images.
An audacious claim
In a scientific paper released Tuesday, researchers at Google claimed that a supercomputer powered by its latest tensor processing unit (TPU) -- a processor specifically designed to train AI models -- outperformed a system powered by comparable Nvidia chips.
The process involves feeding massive amounts of information through these systems to train them for specific tasks, including providing more human-like responses to questions. Because of the enormous datasets used to train these AI models, researchers strung together more than 4,000 TPUs to create a supercomputer, while using specially designed switches to disburse the workload across the massive chipsets.
Google said that in its tests, its 4th generation TPU, which the company uses to train its own AI systems, were as much as 1.7 times faster and 1.9 times more power efficient than Nvidia's comparable A100 Tensor Core GPU.
This would seem to suggest that Google has succeeded in knocking Nvidia off its lofty perch, which would be of great concern to Nvidia shareholders -- but the devil is in the details and the results aren't as cut and dry as you might expect.
Not apples-to-apples
When technology moves at the speed of sound, the latest news is often outdated before the ink is dry and that appears to be the case here.
Early last year, Nvidia announced the development of the H100 ""Hopper"" chip, which the company said would be nine times faster for training AI models and up to 30 times faster for inference -- the process of using the models after they've been trained -- when compared with its A100 chip. The company also said the H100 was the most ""power-efficient Nvidia GPU to date."" This suggests that Nvidia's H100 processor likely outperforms Google's latest TPU across the board.
Google disclosed that it didn't compare its 4th-Gen TPU to the H100 because Nvidia's latest flagship processor hit the market after the research was completed. But the company did suggest that additional upgrades were on the drawing board, noting that Google has ""a healthy pipeline of future chips.""
What these developments mean for investors
It's important for investors to put these latest developments into historical context. This isn't the first time Google has claimed its AI-centric processor was better than a comparable one by Nvidia, only to be outdone by Nvidia's latest innovations.
In its fiscal 2023 (which ended Jan. 29), Nvidia spent $7.34 billion on research and development (R&D) expenses, up 27% compared to fiscal 2022. Not only that, R&D costs last year represented 27% of Nvidia's revenue, up from 20% in the prior year.
This helps illustrate why Nvidia has been the king of the AI-processor hill for so long -- its breakneck pace of innovation. The company's GPUs continue to be the gold standard for training and inference in AI systems. Nvidia has consistently demonstrated its ability to stay one step ahead of all comers, even those with massive size and gargantuan budgets.
That's not to say Alphabet isn't also a worthwhile investment -- which is why I own both.

2023-04-10 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Nvidia Shares Jumped 20% in March,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-nvidia-shares-jumped-20-in-march,"What happened
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock rose 19.7% in March after the company announced important developments in the data center market. The stock also benefited from renewed optimism in the semiconductor industry as analysts and investors speculated that the market was pivoting to a cyclical growth period.
So what
Nvidia has been on a tear in recent months, rising more than 120% since October. This marks an impressive recovery following its collapse earlier last year. Rising interest rates crushed growth stock valuations, while semiconductor demand evaporated due to weakness in consumer electronics and cryptocurrency mining. This was a potent one-two punch to both Nvidia's financial results and its stock price.

Semiconductors are a cyclical and ever-evolving industry, though, and new long-term catalysts have emerged to reignite optimism in Nvidia. Investors have high hopes for big growth in the data center market, with Nvidia positioned to be a leader. At an investor event in March, the company outlined its progress in the data center space and reinforced investor expectations about growth potential. Nvidia is rolling out new products and has strong relationships with all the largest cloud service providers.
Those factors have been driving a recovery over the past six months, and it continued in March thanks to commentary from Nvidia's rivals.
Micron Technologies (NASDAQ: MU) surged higher after the company suggested that inventories had peaked and that the cycle was turning upward.
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) climbed 31% after that company provided positive commentary on AI and data center markets.
AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) rose 25% amid all this industry optimism and bullish commentary from high-profile analysts.
NVDA data by YCharts.
We might not have gotten a ton of news about Nvidia specifically in March, but we saw a deluge of important industry information. It seems that the short-term hurdles in the industry are dissipating, and a handful of companies are making moves to reap rewards in the long term.
Now what
Nvidia's rebound has been sharp even though the current financial results are suffering from cyclically weak demand. The company's revenue dropped 21% last quarter, but that was expected. Investors have now shifted focus to the next few years, and the stock's valuation has been soaring. Its forward PE ratio and price-to-sales ratio both nearly doubled over the past six months.
NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.
Nvidia's long-term growth potential is undeniable thanks to its leadership position in growth markets such as data centers. However, the recent valuation run-up has changed the stock's risk profile. With a forward PE ratio of around 60, Nvidia has to meet high expectations, and it has some obstacles to navigate along the way. A recession seems likely in the short term, and long-term opportunities will always be jeopardized by competition.

NVIDIA Declares $0.04 Dividend
On February 22, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share ($0.16 annualized). Shareholders of record as of March 8, 2023 received the payment on March 29, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.04 per share.
At the current share price of $275.79 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.06%. Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.19%, the lowest has been 0.02%, and the highest has been 0.50%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.12 (n=237).
The current dividend yield is 1.09 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.09. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

2023-04-14 00:00:00+00:00,Should You Invest in Artificial Intelligence Stocks Right Now?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-invest-in-artificial-intelligence-stocks-right-now,"You might be tired of hearing about artificial intelligence (AI) after years of buzz surrounding the technology's revolutionary potential. However, it likely has a far reach and the ability to alter and enhance a vast variety of industries, with its participants likely to see substantial gains over the long term.
The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT last November stunned the tech world with its ability to produce human-like dialogue and kicked off a race in which countless companies have pivoted to AI development. As a result, market leaders such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and C3.ai have watched their stocks skyrocket 80% and 100%, respectively, since Jan. 1, almost entirely on the back of the AI boom.
Despite different forms of AI being utilized and developed for years, the technology still has a long way to go, as do the industries' stocks. Here's why now is an excellent time to consider investing in artificial intelligence stocks.
Artificial intelligence can enhance nearly any industry
According to Grand View Research, the AI market was valued at roughly $137 billion in 2022 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37.3% through 2030. AI adoption is forecast to be widespread, with industries as diverse as cloud computing, automotive, e-commerce, healthcare, and manufacturing increasing their utilization of the technology.
Big-name companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla have all implemented AI in their daily operations. For example, Amazon uses AI in its e-commerce business to recommend products to consumers, track shopping trends, and run intelligent robots in its warehouses. As the biggest investor in OpenAI, Microsoft is using the start-up's software, like ChatGPT, to enhance its cloud service Azure, search engine Bing, and its Office productivity programs. Meanwhile, AI plays a crucial role in Tesla's self-driving cars by gathering real-time data from vehicles' cameras.
However, these are not actually the best companies to invest in AI. As the technology is virtually limitless, choosing which AI business to invest in now is like trying to decide what will be the most successful website in the early 2000s. Chances are, the most prominent AI company still has yet to emerge. As a result, the smart move is to invest in the companies producing the chips and hardware necessary to run and develop AI software.
What are the best AI stocks?
Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are arguably the biggest companies in AI, thanks to their powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). These computing components are essential to run AI workloads.
In fact, Nvidia is the primary supplier of GPUs to ChatGPT, with research from TrendForce showing the AI program required about 20,000 units in 2020. That figure is projected to increase to 30,000 GPUs as ChatGPT commercializes. The partnership has made artificial intelligence Nvidia's No. 1 business, with its data center revenue rising 41% in fiscal 2022, mainly thanks to the flourishing AI market.
Meanwhile, last year, AMD acquired Xilinx, a company producing specialized processors for the automotive, industrial, and artificial intelligence markets. The purchase has proven immensely profitable for AMD, with growth in its embedded segment driven almost entirely by Xilinx in 2022. The business reported a revenue increase of over 1,700% to $4.6 billion.
The choice between whether to invest in Nvidia or AMD is dependent on which is currently the better value. Nvidia's staggering share-price rise this year has made it a little too expensive, with its forward price-to-earnings ratio at 59, compared to AMD's 30. Nvidia's recent run-up likely indicates that its near-term growth in AI has already been baked into its stock, at least for the next few years.
Moreover, AMD's forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.11, compared to Nvidia's 0.3, also indicates AMD is currently undervalued given its potential earnings.
Artificial intelligence will likely play a pivotal role in future technology across multiple industries, making its related stocks worth investing in right now. And AMD is the best value stock to back the booming sector.

Gaming isn’t just fun, it’s great business. Some of the world’s most lucrative intellectual properties exist entirely or almost entirely as video games. And video games command high prices that many entertainment media cannot hope to achieve. It’s no wonder investors keep looking for the next big gaming phenomenon.
Gaming is an art, but it’s technology that pushes it forward. New ways to build, deliver, and play are letting game companies make games that were once only dreamed of. The companies that can harness this technology will be the ones to make bank in the future of gaming.
In addition to technology, the best gaming companies today are innovating in their hardware and software, business models, and support infrastructure. A good gaming company nurtures a community that will keep paying year after year. This positive mindshare should not be overlooked when choosing which gaming stocks to invest in.
Overall, a good gaming company should have good technology, a strong business model, and a loyal consumer base. Here are three gaming stocks that fit the bill and should be on any investor’s radar.
Gaming Stocks: Unity (U)
Source: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.com
Every game needs an engine, and Unity (NYSE:U) remains one of the most popular engines on record. Unity claims that over 70% of mobile games are made with their engine. That, along with a significant fraction of traditional and Virtual Reality (VR) games, gives Unity a large revenue stream from developers who license their engine.
Unity’s dominance of the mobile market should not be understated. Mobile gaming makes up a majority of the gaming industry. Not only that, but it is also growing faster than the industry as a whole. VR games remain a speculative and minor part of the industry. But if the VR market continues to grow, Unity’s large share of that market will also help it.
A big part of Unity’s dominance comes from the network effect, something its competitors will find hard to replicate. Because so many game developers already use Unity, it has thousands of free tutorials and help spaces for developers. And because it has so many resources for developers, many developers gravitate towards it for their projects. A self-reinforcing cycle that keeps Unity on top.
Because Unity has a dominant market share in gaming’s fastest-growing market, it’s primed to grow much faster than the gaming industry as a whole.
Unity’s stock has been beaten down during the recent bear market. And for that reason, many may still see it as a highly speculative play. But the company remains in good shape financially. Unity reported 2022 revenue of $1.4 billion, a year-on-year growth of 25%. And while they had a net loss of $919 million, they have cash on hand of $1.5 billion.
Their revenue is growing by double digits. They have the cash on hand to survive in the near term with no difficulty. And in the medium term, they have room to grow into a gaming phenomenon.
NVIDIA (NVDA)

Gaming has long been an expensive hobby. Consoles and gaming PCs are not cheap products. But NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) believes it has a product for the frugal gamer. NVIDIA’s GeForce Now service lets you play games through streaming without expensive equipment. It hopes to tap into a market as yet unserved by traditional gaming companies.
NVIDIA is not the only company to try streaming games. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) recently shuttered its Google Stadia platform due to a lack of interest. But the Stadia largely died due to a lack of available games. Whereas GeForce Now will soon be able to play all Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox PC games. This ensures a broad library and is great news for the 20 million users already on GeForce Now.
Streaming games may be the future of gaming for another reason. A console or gaming computer can be heavy and hard to take from place to place. But GeForce Now can be used from your phone. More people own phones than computers and consoles combined, and this ability gives NVIDIA a wide market as yet untapped in gaming.
Even without streaming games, NVIDIA has graphics cards that power most modern gaming hardware. With streaming games, it looks set to be one of the most disruptive gaming companies of the coming decade.
Take Two (TTWO)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Take Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) is a leading video game company that could be poised for industry dominance. One of Take Two’s subsidiaries is 2K, whose business model is to release yearly installments of popular sports games. NBA 2K and WWE 2K are mainstays of the genre, and fans buy them year after year. This is a business model that few others can replicate, and it brings consistent revenue to Take Two.
Another major subsidiary of Take Two is Rockstar, makers of some of the most commercially successful games of all time. From Grand Theft Auto to Red Dead Redemption, every Rockstar title is its own mega-event. Where 2K brings consistency, Rockstar brings big gains.
Alongside this impressive portfolio, Take Two has been growing rapidly. Their revenue grew 50% year on year, according to their most recent earnings statement. In the past, Take Two has used its impressive gains to finance growth through mergers. In 2022, they bought mobile gaming giant Zynga. Take Two has shown itself to be conscious of the market it’s in, able to adapt to new trends to maintain its growth.
Overall, Take Two Interactive is a good stock to buy for investors looking to tap into the growing video game industry. Its strong portfolio of popular franchises, successful subsidiary studios, and its growth in mobile gaming means any investor should keep an eye on it.

2023-04-19 00:00:00+00:00,Silicon Selections: 3 “Strong Buy” Semiconductor Stocks to Watch,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/silicon-selections%3A-3-strong-buy-semiconductor-stocks-to-watch,"Only time will tell if it's too late in the game to buy semiconductor stocks as we roll into the spring season. The tech-focused sell-off was most unkind to the many semiconductor leaders last year. I guess you could say the tech wreck of 2022 really ""chipped"" away at chip stock valuations!
In any case, the ensuing relief rally proved fast and furious for many top chip plays such that nervous dip buyers may not have been able to load up the truck as much as they would have liked.
Therefore, in this piece, we'll look at three semiconductor stocks that still boast Strong Buys from Wall Street analysts. As they also have the potential to receive analyst upgrades, the following three names -- NVDA, TSM, and AVGO -- may not be too late to nibble away at.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)
Nvidia is one of the hottest stocks in the market right now. Not even the gravitational force of higher interest rates has been able to keep Nvidia suppressed for too long a duration. As the company continues showcasing its latest and greatest artificial intelligence (AI) innovations, I think it's tough to bet against the firm, even as its valuation swells to the moon again. Though I wish the stock was much cheaper, it's hard to be anything but bullish.
The company has exposure to plenty of emerging tech fields (think AI and the Metaverse) and will help power new trends that may yet be on our radars. When it comes to such companies that find ways to expand their circle of competencies, a premium multiple can be expected. Just how much of a premium Nvidia deserves right here is the main question on the minds of many forward-focused investors.
Currently, many believe Nvidia can keep delivering as it rides the latest wave of AI innovation. With the generative AI platform Picasso and the cutting-edge hardware featured in advanced supercomputers, there's a strong appeal in owning a part of NVDA's generational growth story.
As more firms pull the curtain on their AI offerings, it's conceivable that a significant portion of the market will invest in the latest AI-focused chips. Even at a lofty 159 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, accurately predicting the extent of demand over the next decade remains uncertain. Given this, I do believe Nvidia is one of the ""expensive"" stocks that's worth averaging into over time.
Also, HSBC recently rewarded Nvidia stock with a double upgrade, helping power shares to a 2.5% gain on Tuesday. While I'm not a fan of chasing, I do think bullish analysts have no choice but to chase or be left out in the cold.
What is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?
Nvidia stock's still a Strong Buy, with 29 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell. The average NVDA stock price target of $286.94 implies 2.7% upside potential.
Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)
For those feeling woozy by Nvidia's sky-high multiple, Taiwan Semiconductor stands out as a more palatable value play at this juncture. Shares of TSM trade at just 13.7 times trailing price/earnings, well below the semiconductor industry average of 61.4 times. Though Warren Buffett recently noted that he sees ""better places"" to invest than Taiwan Semi after selling off most of his stake many months ago, I still see many reasons to stay bullish.
First, Taiwan Semi stock already seems to have ripped the band-aid off amid the chaos hitting the chip space. The stock's sitting down more than 37% off its all-time high of around $140 and change per share. Though shares have recovered modestly, they're still in a bit of a rut, with macro headwinds and geopolitical risks weighing heavily.
Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini thinks a sluggish (or L-shaped) semiconductor recovery is ""dialed into TSM's share price."" I think Mr. Hosseini is right.
Second, Taiwan Semi still boasts a pretty sizeable moat. The company plans to expand rapidly over time, even in the face of macro headwinds. As the firm continues investing heavily in capacity, it'll be hard for up-and-coming rivals to catch up. If anything, TSM may be in a spot to pull further ahead on the other side of a potential recession.
Mr. Hosseini thinks top rivals are ""years away"" from catching up to the likes of Taiwan Semi. At this rate, I'd argue such rivals may struggle to catch up even in a few years.
What is the Price Target for TSM Stock?
Taiwan Semi boasts a Strong Buy rating from analysts based on four unanimous Buys. The average TSM stock price target is $118.67, suggesting 36% upside potential from here.
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)
Broadcom is a yield-heavy semiconductor play that's less than 7% off all-time highs. Indeed, Broadcom stock could be the first of the trio to break through to new heights as investors continue gaining confidence. With a dividend yield that's still bountiful (near 3%) and intriguing AI offerings of its own, I remain bullish.
Shares of Broadcom are up more than 50% from their May 2022 lows. Looking back, macro fears got a tad out of hand. Though shares aren't the same bargain as they were several months ago, shares are still attractively valued at 21.3 times trailing price-to-earnings, well below their five-year historical average P/E of 35.4.
More recently, Broadcom stock's been riding high on news of a new chip called Jerich3-AI to help bring together AI networks. Looking ahead, I'd look for Broadcom to add to its AI arsenal as it looks to continue taking advantage of M&A opportunities. Combined with Broadcom's software push, I view the stock as worthy of further multiple expansion.
What is the Price Target for AVGO Stock?
Even after the hot run, analysts remain very upbeat about the stock. AVGO has a Strong Buy rating comprised of 14 Buys and three Holds. The average AVGO stock price target of $702.50 implies 10.7% upside potential.
Conclusion
It may not be too late to buy the chip dip, according to analysts. Currently, TSM stock boasts the most upside potential, with nearly 36% gains expected over the year ahead.

2023-04-20 00:00:00+00:00,Why Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Stock Rallied Thursday Morning,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-stock-rallied-thursday-morning,"What happened
Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), also known as TSMC, surged higher Thursday, jumping as much as 5.3%. As of 10:55 a.m. ET today, the stock was still up 3%.
The catalyst that sent the semiconductor specialist higher was quarterly results that weren't nearly as bad as investors had feared.
So what
For the first quarter, revenue was 508.63 billion New Taiwan dollars (roughly $16.65 billion), an increase of 3.6%. The bottom line also climbed, with net income of 206.99 billion New Taiwan dollars (roughly $6.78 billion), an increase of 2%. This resulted in diluted earnings per American depositary share of about $1.31.
To put its results into the context of expectations, analysts' consensus estimates had been calling for revenue of $16.6 billion and EPS of $1.21, so the results were better than expected.
As the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, TSMC is seen as a bellwether for the semiconductor industry, which has suffered at the hands of the economic slowdown in the U.S. Apple is the company's largest customer, with its purchases representing roughly 26% of its revenue last year. TSMC also supplies semiconductors for other high-profile chip companies, including Nvidia. Both companies have reported year-over-year sales declines in their most recent quarters.
Now what
TSMC expects the current challenging environment to continue. ""Our first-quarter business was impacted by weakening macroeconomic conditions,"" chief financial officer Wendell Huang said. ""Moving into second quarter 2023, we expect our business to continue to be impacted by customers' further inventory adjustment.""
The company expects second-quarter revenue in a range of $15.2 billion to $16 billion, with operating margins of 40.5% at the midpoint of its guidance, down from 45.5% in the current quarter. Analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $16.1 billion, helping to illustrate the depth of the expected sales decline.
Loop Capital analyst Charles Park sees the glass as half full. Despite the current macroeconomic conditions, ""TSMC is better positioned to weather the slowdown and should benefit from the structural growth in semis longer term,"" Park said, according to The Fly.
For investors with a longer-term outlook, this is merely a bump in the road.

2023-04-21 00:00:00+00:00,Wall St Week Ahead-Tech earnings to test markets' 'most crowded' trade,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-st-week-ahead-tech-earnings-to-test-markets-most-crowded-trade,"By David Randall
NEW YORK, April 21 (Reuters) - A blistering rally in megacap growth and technology shares has buoyed markets this year, and earnings reports in coming weeks could help investors determine if those gains are justified.
U.S. technology stocks are currently the ""most crowded"" trade in the market, fund managers surveyed by BofA Global Research said, as investors pile into megacaps thinking the Federal Reserve will soon stop tightening monetary policy and that the sector will remain resilient as growth slows.
Rallies in stocks such as Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Tesla IncTSLA.O have helped sustain broader indexes in the face of recession worries and last month's banking crisis sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.
Apple and Microsoft, up 27% and 19% this year, respectively, together accounted for nearly half of the S&P 500's .SPXtotal advance through March, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The index is up around 7.5% year-to-date.
Whether that rally continues could depend on companies beating already-lowered first-quarter estimates. Technology earnings are seen falling 14.4%. Communication services companies, including Meta Platforms Inc META.O and Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, are expected to post declines of 12%, according to Refinitiv data.
After steep declines in 2022, ""this is a group that was an underweight for a number of people and now you're seeing some of the momentum take off,"" said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas at UBS. Earnings will show ""whether this is really a safe haven if you are worried about recession.""
Alphabet and Microsoft are expected to report their results on April 25, followed by Apple on May 4. Amazon, part of the consumer discretionary sector, is expected to announce results on April 27. Tesla shares fell nearly 10% after missing earnings estimates on April 19.
Companies will likely use earnings reports over the next several weeks to announce further plans for layoffs, which could bolster margins ahead of a recession and make their shares more attractive, said Robert Stimpson, co-chief investment officer and portfolio manager for Oak Associates Funds.
Alphabet in January announced 12,000 job cuts, followed by Amazon in March with 9,000 cuts, and others that bring the total to 27,000 layoffs over recent months.
""Tech corrected very hard last year and it's already discounted for some sort of recession, given that it has accepted that it has to cut headcount and retrench a little bit,"" said Stimpson. ""It's an industry that is accepting its medicine.""
Stimpson is overweight technology and cutting back on his energy exposure in anticipation of a recession.
However, signs of improving profitability could power ""another leg up"" in the rally, said Tom Plumb, portfolio manager of the Plumb Funds, who has large positions in Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Apple. Nvidia shares are up more than 90% this year.
""We paid the penalty for holding on to a number of these stocks last year,"" Plumb said. ""In today's market growth is something that people think will be a challenge and if you can identify growth you'll be rewarded.""
Still, gains could fizzle if the Fed does not cut interest rates this year, as widely expected. While the central bank has projected borrowing costs will stay around current levels until year end, investors are pricing rate cuts after the summer.
Elevated rates would likely weigh heavily on technology valuations, which have soared since the year began, said Max Wasserman, senior portfolio manager at Miramar Capital. Growth stocks are especially vulnerable to high borrowing costs, which threaten to erode the value of their longer-term cash flows.
Apple is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26.5, while Microsoft's ratio is 27.4, compared to 18 for the S&P 500.
""You're seeing extremely high multiples in a rising interest rates environment because the market is betting the Fed will reverse its policies,"" he said. ""We think it's a faulty assumption and the risk-reward is not in your favor.""

Chris Hill: Your call is very important to us. Please remain on the line to listen to the next available episode. Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Chris Hill joining me today, Motley Fool Senior Analyst, Bill Mann. Good to see you, my friend.
Bill Mann: Well, we barely made it here.
Chris Hill: There were some technical problems and the dozens of listeners don't care about that. Let's just plow ahead, shall we?
Bill Mann: I was speaking more toward our dueling back injuries.
Chris Hill: Well, there's that too, but [laughs] there's only so much that doesn't care about that as well. Before we get to Johnson and Johnson, we are through all of the big bank's reporting. We got Bank of America reporting this morning. It started last week with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Citi. When you step back and look at the current state of the big banks, does anything, in particular, stand out to you whether it's any one bank's results, commentary from a CEO or any through line that you see among them?
Bill Mann: I think maybe the most interesting throughline happened both over the weekend when Warren Buffett had his sit down with CNBC with Becky Quick and he was noting that he sold out of banks, some of which he had held for the last 25 years because he did becomes so concerned about how accounting principles we're creating bad incentives for the banks and the one that he called out that he wanted to continue holding and did continue holding in full effect was Bank of America. Who turns out today just came out and crushed it in terms of their earnings, but crushed it in a very specific way. Brian Moynihan, the CEO, came out and said straight up, the results demonstrate just how over the last decade we have been consistent in our commitment to responsible growth, which I think a lot of banks that find themselves now under duress were not quite as responsible. Fascinating to me that Warren Buffett stepped back from the banking sector but stuck with Bank of America.
Chris Hill: Someday, Brian Moynihan is going to retire as CEO of Bank of America. When that happens.
Bill Mann: It's taken over.
Chris Hill: Just going to say someone is going to write about his tenure at Bank of America, which really got off to a rocky start. I think about the Countrywide acquisition that they made. Obviously, they spent years writing that thing down. They dealt with the great recession like everybody else. But the persistence of Moynihan and the way he has, as you said, they've just consistently gone about their business. It's one of those things that if you've been a patient shareholder and you've stood by Moynihan, I think you've been rewarded.
Bill Mann: Yeah, it's true, and if you think about it in some ways, among the big banks, all of them saw a surge in deposits, which is probably not surprising given the amount of turmoil that's at the smaller banks. Not that banks like Silicon Valley banks are small. But they're not one of the huge banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and their ilk. One of the most interesting things to me is that they've all done pretty well. But in some ways, Bank of America is almost like the vanilla ice cream of the banking sector they're never crushing it. But at the same time, they're never having to really explain a whole lot of missteps that they've made it. It's just a well-run bank and unlike almost every other industry, I find myself getting nervous when I see a bank's deposit surging or their earnings number surging. For Bank of America under Brian Moynihan, just to get it done quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter. It really does remind you that investing is a long-term game, but maybe more than any other industry. If you're going to hold financials, you just have to make sure that you have one that's not going to be exciting for all the wrong reasons.
Chris Hill: Let's move on to Johnson and Johnson, which started off the fiscal year about as well as you can, profits and revenue were higher than expected in the first quarter. They raised guidance for the full fiscal year, gave the dividend a little bit of a boost. I'm not sure why the stock is off a couple of percentage points, but this seemed like a pretty strong start to the year.
Bill Mann: You have to be careful with whenever a company starts with the words adjusted, anything. In this case, they listed adjusted earnings of $2.68 per share, which beat the $2.50 per share. Now, what is the adjustment in this case, it's $6.9 billion of what is nearly a nine-billion-dollar settlement that they have because of Johnson's baby powder, excuse me, having been found to cause cancer. There's a huge element of cost, but they adjust their earnings because it is truly what you would hope onetime in nature. Yeah, it was a good quarter from them raising the dividend nearly 5%. It was a really good quarter in their medical device division. The great setup there for what we really see as continued reopening and a resurgence of demand during the pandemic. One of the things that maybe we focused on for a while and then forgot about was that all elective surgeries were put off down the road. I think you're seeing a lot of a rebound in that type of demand. It was a really great quarter from them. They did come out and say that their results were a condition of really every single division that they had doing better than they had anticipated.
Chris Hill: Real quick before we move on, later this year if everything goes according to plan, Johnson and Johnson will execute the split that the company has been planning for the last year plus. Anytime a company is trying to execute something like this where spinning off a division or we're just splitting into multiple parts. What does history, if anything, tell us about what to be watching for? If you're a shareholder, are you nervous about this at all? Is there a way to screw this up or is that the thing where like no, if they're doing this right, this should be fine.
Bill Mann: There are plenty of ways to screw it up, especially going out of the gate. I'm not going to claim at all to say that Johnson and Johnson is doing this because they are not. But you've seen situations where a company in doing a spin-off of a division that's not important to the parent company does something like just lard up the spinoff company with a bunch of debt. A chemical company called Rhodia did that with Innophos about 15 years ago. It was a tiny spin-off, but it was a huge amount of the debt of Rhodia got sent with the spinoff company. Obviously, that makes it hard for a smaller company to really get its footing. I think probably the best model that you can look at here for Johnson and Johnson, who is a spin-off a couple of years ago by Procter & Gamble of some of its food division, and that has worked really well. It's given investors the opportunity to focus on whether they want to buy a commercial products company, primarily or do they want to a food company, I think in the case of Johnson and Johnson, the same thing is true. It's really hard to tease out where the growth at Johnson and Johnson is coming from. Not that they don't have growth, but is it band-aids? Is it knee replacements? Is it contacts? The ability for investors to be able to fine-tune where they want to gain exposure, I think is a positive.
Chris Hill: NVIDIA got an upgrade today from a Wall Street firm. And I just wanted your reaction to what I think is the most amazing pull quote from the upgrade, which is the following sentence. We're shocked by Nvidia's pricing power on AI chips.
Bill Mann: Sorry, I didn't mean to laugh [laughs]
Chris Hill: No, that was my reaction. I was like, why are you shocked by that? I mean, we were just talking about you mentioned Procter and Gamble. I wouldn't say I was shocked. I was surprised by the pricing power that Procter and Gamble has demonstrated over the past year or so. P&G is not what leaps to mind when I think about companies with pricing power, NVIDIA with AI chips. Why are you surprised by this?
Bill Mann: A qualifying question, was this written or spoken?
Chris Hill: This was written.
Bill Mann: This person thought about it and then wrote that. That's amazing to me. You are talking about a company that in several segments, and in the last two years it was crypto mining. Before that it was graphics, and now in artificial intelligence, they have the leading edge chips that has been absolutely imperative for those industries or segments of industry or in terms of processing power, etc. Of course, they have pricing power. I don't know how that's a shock.
Chris Hill: It's always nice to be validated. Bill Mann great talking to you.
Bill Mann: Thanks, Chris.
Chris Hill: You've got questions, they've got answers. Robert Brokamp and Alison Southwick answer listener questions about recessions, employee stock options, and mortgages.
Alison Southwick: Our first question comes from Cheryl in Massachusetts, dear doctor awfulizing. Bro, that's you.
Robert Brokamp: It is me.
Alison Southwick: Duck off if you're really close to him, and Alison, it's also sent to me. Total credit card debt is about $1 trillion and the Fed keeps hiking interest rates. I think this will lead to people pulling back on their spending and that will create an economic depression. There's no way this ends well. You found a fellow awfulizing and Cheryl bro[laughs]
Robert Brokamp: I know is it, it's so nice to be so pessimistic. We'll see, I'm not quite that pessimistic, but indeed credit card debt is at an all-time high, almost $1 trillion. Previous record was 850 billion before the pandemic and then dropped to 750 billion almost exactly two years ago. But since then it has skyrocketed. It's not just the level of debt that is problematic, the average credit card rate is at an all-time high of over 20%, up from just 16% a year ago. Then the rates and auto loans and mortgages are also up significant over the past year, thanks to the Federal Reserve raising interest rates nine times over the past 13 months, and the Fed is raising rates to intentionally slow down the economy and its working. Bloomberg does a monthly survey of economists. The one from late March had 65% expecting recession in the next 12 months, and that's up from 60% in February. Yeah, Cheryl, this likely will lead to people cutting back on their spending. In fact, it's already happening, in June of last year, the US personal savings rate hit a measly 2.7%, which was pretty close to an all-time low. Since then, it has inched up to 4.6%. Saving more and spending less, it's good for a household, but not necessarily for the broader economy. In fact, there's an economic theory known as the paradox of thrift, which states that increased saving can actually be a drag on the economy, especially when it's economy-driven, almost 70% by consumer spending.
They're playing the other headwinds to add to this negative narrative, and I'll just mention one, and that is the cutback in lending by banks so they don't suffer the same fate as Silicon Valley Bank and some others from last month. In the last two weeks of March, bank lending contracted by the most in history as banks shared up their balance sheets. When banks play it safer, the economy can suffer. Cheryl in keeping with my doctor awfulizer reputation, I agree with you that things could get pretty rough before they get better. However, I don't really see anything that makes me feel like we're going to see anything worse than the typical recession. Since World War II, recessions have lasted around 10 months on average. Could something happen that leads to a depression? Sure. I mean, anything truly as possible. But I'm sticking to a mantra that I've mentioned before on the show, and it's my mantra regardless of what's going on in the economy. That is, be a short-term pessimist and a long-term optimist. Protect the money you need in the next few years. If you're still working, keep tabs on your company and your customers because during a recession, you should be more worried about your job than your portfolio. But keep your long-term money in the stock market. Because historically in the US, we've always recovered from every recession and every depression.
Alison Southwick: Our next question comes from Anush. My employer is offering an employee stock purchase plan which allows me to contribute a certain percentage of my base pay toward a purchase of discounted shares. I'm curious as to why certain companies offer this and what is the benefit to me as a long-term shareholder, I already contribute to a 401K up to the company match, but am I missing out on anything if I decide not to enroll in this stock purchase plan?
Robert Brokamp: Well, Anush you're not alone. According to CNBC, almost three-quarters of publicly traded companies offer some employee stock purchase plan, and almost 40% of them offer their shares at some discount. The most common of which is a 15% discount. Companies do this for a few reasons. First of all, they like to offer benefits that employees appreciate, tracks employees, it keeps employees, and offering discounted stock is a relatively inexpensive benefit. Also, they may believe that when employees have a vested interest in the success of the company, they'll perform better. The companies want to create what they'll often call an ownership mentality among their employees. Because when you own shares, you indeed are a bonafide, genuine part owner of the company. There are some studies that have found that employees who participate in these types of plans do work harder. If the stock performs well or even slightly below the market's average, you'll do well because you bought in at a discount. Those are the good things.
Let's cover some of the downsides and the biggest is that you don't want too much of your portfolio tied to the same fate as the company that gives you your paycheck, provides your health insurance, that type of stuff. One rule of thumb is to not have more than 10% of your portfolio in one company, and perhaps even less if you work for that company. I mean, many employees of Silicon Valley Bank had a lot of money in SVB stock. An article in Fortune said that for some employees up to 50% of their compensation came in the form of company stock, and the share price declined from an all-time high of $750 to a current price of $0.50, which hurts a lot of people. But also, if you're going to look into this plan, pay attention to how long you have to wait until you can sell. You may not be able to just sell it immediately for a guarantee profit. Factor that into the timeframe you have for this money. But if you believe in the company and you have the money buying in, into shares of a good company at a 15% discount or whatever discount you're being given is a pretty attractive offer.
Alison Southwick: Our next question comes from Jase. Hey Fools. I have three different 401Ks from previous employment and one IRA from an old employer as well. Would it not be advantageous to roll these into my new 401K sponsored by my new employer? I'm thinking a larger pool would return more than four separate accounts, but I've had others warn this is a mistake, thoughts?
Robert Brokamp: I would start by saying having more assets at a single account generally doesn't result in higher returns, unless it would qualify you maybe more for better services or reduced fees or maybe investments with higher minimums. But that's generally not the case in a 401(k). For both people at this situation, the best thing to do actually would be to transfer the old 401(k)s to the IRA. That's because 401(k)s generally have higher costs, fewer investment options, and less flexibility for ways to touch the money. That said, there are a few scenarios when moving all your money to a current 401(k) might make sense, and here are just four of those very quickly. Number 1, your current plan may be has particularly high-quality or low-cost investments that you couldn't get outside the plan, so you'd want to move more money into it. Number 2 would be you want to do something called the backdoor Roth IRA because your income is too high to make a regular contribution to a Roth IRA. With the backdoor Roth, you make a contribution to a nondeductible traditional IRA and then immediately convert it to a Roth or very soon thereafter. If you do have money in traditional IRAs elsewhere and you do the conversion, it's not necessarily a tax-free decision due to something called the pro-rata rules. But if you really want that Roth IRA, what you could do is roll the IRA into a 401(k) and you don't have to worry about them.
Number 3, reasons why you might want to put all the money in one 401(k) is that you'll be retiring between the ages of 55 and 59 1/2. Generally, if you take a withdrawal from retirement account before age 59 1/2, you have to pay a 10% penalty. But for some 401(k)s, if the 401(k) administrator allows this, if you retire from that company's 401(k) between the ages of 55 and 59 1/2, you can take the money out early and not pay the 10% penalty. Then the number for reason would be you want to delay required minimum distributions. For most accounts, they must begin at age 73, but there's an exception. You don't have to take required minimum distributions from a 401(k) if you are working for the employer that offers the 401(k). You can't do that if you own more than 5% or 10% of the company. But for most people, that's fine. You bring all the money into that 401(k) and you don't have to worry about required minimum distributions until you retire. Those are just some considerations. Of course, this isn't an all-or-nothing choice. You can transfer some of the money to an IRA and some to your current 401(k), if that makes sense for you.
Alison Southwick: Next question comes from Stan in Austin. I'd like to buy a house this fall in the $500,000 range. My realtor told me that I'll be able to take out a 40-year mortgage soon. Any catches that I need to be aware of?
Robert Brokamp: There's some confusion about this. I'll start by saying, I mean, theoretically, 40-year mortgages have been theoretically around for a while. There's nothing that prevents a lender from offering a 40-year mortgage. The problem is it's just not very common. It's difficult to find a lender that offers them. You usually have to go through a broker who maybe could work with a local bank or a credit union or something like that. Also, 40-year mortgages would be considered non-conforming, which means they're not approved by the FHA, and you'd have to pay a higher interest rate. It's just very difficult to find a 40-year mortgage. However, this has been in the news because recently the FHA did decide that for people who are in distress and who are struggling paying their mortgage payments and are already in default, they can turn their mortgage into a 40-year mortgage. That's probably what your realtor was thinking about. But generally, it's not the type of situation where you can just go out and get a 40-year mortgage. Just in case you do go looking for one and you do find one, the downside is that you'll just pay more in interest rate. If you're spreading the loan over a longer period, you'll get a smaller monthly payment, which could be good, but you'll pay way more in interest. Bankrate had an article on this. Just as an example, if you took out a $312,000 loan at a 6.85 interest rate, you paid out over 30 years, your total payments, principal and interest, would be $424,000. Total payments over 40 years, $600,000. You're talking about $175,000 difference or so. Generally speaking, I wouldn't go out there looking for a 40-year mortgage. Stick with the 30 or even the 15 if you could afford it.
Alison Southwick: Our next question comes from Aaron. I just started a job and I'm going through my 401(k) paperwork. I'm planning on contributing 8% and will get a 3% match. However, I don't know how much risk I should take. For now, I just click the middle between conservative and aggressive investing on the slidey swiper thing, good old slidey swiper thing. Also, picked the regular option instead of the Roth. Does that sound reasonable to you or should I change it?
Robert Brokamp: These are excellent questions, and the right answer for you will be very dependent on things like your age or income and how much you've already saved. I don't know those things, but I can still offer some general thoughts. You are saving 11% of your income for retirement, that's your 8% that you're contributing and the 3% match. If you're in your '20s or so, that might be enough. But generally, you should be shooting for 15%, unless you are getting a late start, late '30s, '40s, then you should be shooting for even higher. Think about that in terms of how much to save. In terms of the slidey swiper thing, I would want to know if that factors in your age as well as your risk tolerance. It sounds like to me like you have a moderate risk tolerance, but a moderate risk tolerance for someone who is in their '20s will look very different from someone with a moderate risk tolerance to someone in their '50s or '60s. I hope that tool factors in your age. But another consideration might be a target date retirement fund if your plan offers them, and most do these days.
You choose a target date retirement fund that has a date in its name that's around when you want to retire, and for farther out, it'll be very aggressive. But then it gets gradually more conservative as you get closer to the retirement date, and it does all the asset allocation for you: stocks, bonds, cash, US stocks, international stocks. It's a pretty reasonable allocation for someone with a moderate risk tolerance. Then as for the Roth, it really just depends on your tax bracket today versus where you think it will be when you retire. This doesn't have to be an either-or decision. You can contribute to both. Unless you're in a very high tax bracket, I'd contribute at least some to the Roth account because it gives you some so-called tax diversification in retirement. If you're in the 12% tax bracket, the Roth is almost a definite, even in the 22% tax bracket. It might make sense to contribute to the Roth or at least some to a Roth. Since we all just did our taxes, it should be pretty easy to figure out where we are on the tax bracket spectrum.
Alison Southwick: Next question comes from Eric in Montana. I own two foreign companies and I've been reinvesting dividends for several years. They are Johnson Controls Inc and Linde PLC. But my broker was acquired, now I can't reinvest these dividends as fractional shares since they are from foreign companies and it's against my new broker's rules. That's me editorializing there. Should I consider selling out these positions because I can't reinvest the dividends? I don't expect an opinion on the companies, but the opportunity to passively compound shares is a huge plus for nearly all the positions I hold.
Robert Brokamp: Well, Eric, if you still believe in the companies, you don't have to sell, especially if this account isn't an IRA and you have some capital gains in there. Because if you sold, then you'd have to owe the taxes. Instead, you can just transfer the account to a different broker that allows fractional shares for dividend reinvestment for these types of stocks. Of course, if there isn't an IRA and all the shares are net loss, you actually might want to sell. You lock it a loss that you could write off on your 2023 tax return and then just move the cash to a different broker, but then don't buy the shares back within 30 days or you'll be in violation of the wash-sale rules and you won't be able to write off those losses. Those are some ideas, but you're absolutely right that passively and automatically reinvesting your dividends is very powerful. It allows you to buy more shares, which then pay more dividends, which then allow you to buy even more shares and so on. It's this snowball effect. If you instead have to wait until enough dividends accumulate as cash so you can buy another share, you'll miss out on a lot of growth, assuming that the share prices rise over time. Definitely, I think it makes sense to put some effort and defining a broker that will automatically reinvest your dividends.

2023-04-25 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia releases software tools to help chatbots watch their language,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-releases-software-tools-to-help-chatbots-watch-their-language,"By Stephen Nellis
April 25 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, a major supplier of chips and computing systems for artificial intelligence, on Tuesday released a set of software tools aimed at helping chatbots watch their language.
Nvidia's chips have helped companies like Microsoft Corp MSFT.O add human-like chat features to search engines like Bing. But the chatbots can still be unpredictable and say things their creators wish they did not.
Microsoft in February limited users to five questions per session with its Bing search engine after the New York Times reported the system gave unsettling responses during long conversations.
Nvidia's software tools, provided free of charge, are designed to help companies guard against unwanted responses from chatbots. Some of those uses are straightforward - the maker of a customer service chatbot might not want the system to mention products from its competitors.
But the Nvidia tools are also designed to help AI system creators put into place important safety measures, such as ensuring that chatbots do not respond with potentially dangerous information such as how to create weapons or send users to unknown links that could contain computer viruses.
U.S. lawmakers have called for regulations around AI systems as apps like ChatGPT have surged in popularity. Few legal rules or industry standards exist on how to make AI systems safe.

2023-04-27 00:00:00+00:00,Stinky Breadth: FAANG Masks Market Weakness Beneath the Surface,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stinky-breadth%3A-faang-masks-market-weakness-beneath-the-surface,"FAANG’s Dominance
FAANG is an acronym that stands for Facebook (now Meta Platforms (META)), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (now Alphabet (GOOGL)). The “FAANG” stocks rose to prominence over the past decade due to their strong price and fundamental performance and massive market caps. Since their initial rise, investors have often added to the group of stocks and have included the likes of stocks such as Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA).

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Pictured: META and the FAANG names are outperforming the general market by a longshot.
Though the market has thousands of stocks to choose from, these stocks have earned the hype and popularity and continue to be the overwhelming choice of retail and tech-oriented institutional investors. Despite their already massive size, these stocks continue to gain market share through innovation, high growth, and market dominance. To give you an idea of FAANG’s dominance, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon now comprise around 30% of the market cap weighting of the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ).
Mega-Cap Tech’s Outsized Performance
Because three in four stocks tend to follow the general market’s direction, in the 2022 bear market, most stocks fell – including FAANG. However, in 2023, FAANG stocks are once again outperforming – and the performance is becoming more profound. For example, Microsoft leaped 7% on earnings earlier this week. Meta Platforms is up more than 10% this morning following its report. Conversely, smaller growth-tech names such as Mobileye (MBLY), Impinj (PI), and Netgear (NTGR) are getting clobbered by 10% or more after their reports.
Stinky Breadth
The dichotomy between mega-cap tech stocks and traditional growth names is the largest in recent times. Does it matter, though? The short answer is yes, eventually, it will matter. Weak participation (also known as breadth), can be sustained in the short-term. However, eventually the stocks that are holding the market indices up will succumb to gravity and pullback. In other words, you shouldn’t trust an index’s move just because it is marching higher – a few large weighted stocks, such as Microsoft, can skew the results and mask weakness beneath the surface.
An Easy Way to Gauge Participation
There are many ways to gauge market breadth, including the advance/decline line, new highs & new lows, and the up/down volume. However, one of the easiest methods I have found is to simply compare an equal-weighted index to a market cap-weighted index. Below is a year-to-date performance chart of QQQ – the most popular tech ETF.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
While QQQ is up 17% in 2023, the Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight Index (QQQE) is only up a feeble 8%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
In other words, currently, the market is being held up by just a few strong mega-cap stocks.
Takeaway
A signficant dichotomy exists in the market between QQQ and QQQE. Investors should not simply take an index’s performance at face value but rather take the time to compare it to an equal-weighted index. Breadth is an important concept to understand as a rally is only sustainable for a long period of time with strong participation. Remember, a few large-cap stocks can mask the performance beneath the surface.

2023-04-28 00:00:00+00:00,Wall St Week Ahead-Recession worries simmer beneath US stock market rally,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-st-week-ahead-recession-worries-simmer-beneath-us-stock-market-rally,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - Economically sensitive areas of the U.S. stock market are flashing warnings over growth, even as major equity indexes edge higher.
The S&P 500 is up 8.6% for the year after gaining 1.5% in April, thanks to roaring year-to-date rallies in shares of Microsoft MSFT.O, Amazon AMZN.O and Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL.O and other growth and technology stocks that command heavy weightings in broader indexes.
Beneath the surface, however, areas of the market tied to economic sentiment such as transports, semiconductors and small-cap stocks dropped in April, while so-called defensive sectors are outperforming.
Investors cited growing caution among market participants faced with a thicket of concerns, from fears of a possible U.S. default this summer to worries that the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary tightening could bring on a recession.
“People are starting to more defensively position themselves,” said Aaron Dunn, co-head of the value equity team at Eaton Vance. “The overall signal to me is there is still a lot of fear about recession and oncoming weakness in the back half of the year.”
Areas of the market showing cracks include the Russell 2000 .RUT, an index populated by smaller, domestically focused companies, which was down 1.9% for the month. The Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT, another bellwether of economic health, fell 2.9%.
A 7.3% drop in the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX was a worrying sign, as chips are ubiquitous in a wide range of products. The index is still up 18% for the year.
Regional banks are also wobbling, with the KBW Regional Banking index .KRX down 3.5% in April following a rout this week in shares of First Republic Bank FRC.N. At the same time, consumer staples .SPLRCS and healthcare .SPXHC, sectors favored by investors during uncertain times, have rallied in the past month.
Investors will focus on next week's Fed meeting, with the central bank expected to announce another 25 basis point rate hike on Wednesday. A bevy of earnings are also on deck, including results from Apple AAPL.O on Thursday.
Though the S&P 500 has shown resilience, just seven stocks -- Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla TSLA.O Meta Platforms META.O and Nvidia NVDA.O -- were responsible for more than 88% of its year-to-date gain as of Thursday, according to Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jones Trading.
“It makes me nervous to be honest,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson. “It just seems like the market gains are being concentrated in fewer and fewer stocks and that is probably unsustainable for too long.”
Ragan is recommending clients overweight defensive sectors such as healthcare, staples and utilities.
While results from megacaps and strong economic reports buoyed optimism among some on Wall Street, others focused on downbeat news from companies in economically sensitive areas.
Shares of United Parcel Service UPS.N tumbled 10% on Tuesday after the world's largest parcel delivery firm pegged annual revenue at the lower end of its forecast and warned of persistent pressure on volumes. The next day, shares of Old Dominion Freight Line ODFL.O also dropped 10% after the trucking firm missed quarterly estimates for profit and revenue.
""They are talking about demand being down and they are ridiculously important shipping companies,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak.
Maley is recommending clients hold higher-than-typical cash levels because of concerns about a recession and because safer assets now have higher yields, while favoring energy and defense stocks.
Of course, not all signs have pointed to economic weakness in recent weeks.
Overall, earnings have come in better than feared for the first quarter. With just over half of the S&P 500 having reported, earnings are on pace to have declined 1.9% for the first quarter from the year earlier period, according to Refinitiv. That is a smaller decline than the 5.1% drop expected at the start of April.
Meanwhile, data on Thursday showed an acceleration in consumer spending in the first quarter as U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 1.1% annualized rate.
""It's hard to have a recession when consumers' incomes are rising, and they are spending more on both goods and services,"" Yardeni Research said in a note on Friday.

2023-05-01 00:00:00+00:00,"Nvidia, the Market Leader, is Breaking Out on Volume",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-the-market-leader-is-breaking-out-on-volume,"Nvidia (NVDA) is the worldwide leader in graphic processing units (GPUs). In my opinion, as far as growth stocks are concerned, it is the “true market leader” in the current market cycle. The stock has all the characteristics of a leading stock, including a unique product offering, liquidity, fundamentals, and the price and volume strength to go with it.
Unique product offering: Nvidia has found its way into some of the market’s most intriguing growth areas, such as data centers. Nvidia is the undisputed leader in the data center space. Currently, the AI market is growing at an unprecedented pace. As AI grows, so will the need for more robust data centers. Furthermore, NVDA chips are used in other high-growth areas such as autonomous driving vehicles and crypto mining “rigs”.
Liquidity: Institutional growth investors look for what I call the “magic elixir” – high growth potential and deep liquidity. From a liquidity perspective, NVDA is worth $700 billion and trades 48 million shares per day on average. From a growth perspective, analysts tracked by Zacks expect the company to more than double earnings next quarter on a year-over-year basis.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Fundamentals: NVDAis a cash-rich company with a strong balance sheet. The company has over $13 billion in cash on hand while it has debt of only $9.7 billion. Since the company has billions in net cash, NVDA can use existing cash for strategic acquisitions and growth opportunities to maintain its dominance in the semiconductor sector. NVDA also boasts a return on equity (ROE) of 26.61 versus the peer group average of 19.45. In other words, NVDA is much more financially efficient than its industry peers.
Technical View: NVDA has had the “cleanest” price and volume trend out of almost any company on Wall Street this year. The stock is outperforming 98% of the market. Since we do not like chasing stocks, I patiently waited for NVDA to present a low-risk entry point. NVDA has consolidated for five weeks, which should help to burn off excess bullishness. As of this morning, the stock is breaking out on heavy volume – a bullish sign.

2023-05-02 00:00:00+00:00,Bear of the Day: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM),NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bear-of-the-day%3A-taiwan-semiconductor-tsm,"Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is the giant chip foundry that serves the world's most important manufacturers, like Apple and NVIDIA.

These big clients are considered ""fabless"" because they rely on foundries like Samsung and Taiwan Semi (aka, TSMC) to conduct wafer fabrication of their designs.

On April 20, TSMC reported profit of $6.8 billion in its first quarter. On a per-share basis, the Hsinchu, Taiwan-based company said it had profit of $1.31, which beat the Zacks Consensus estimate of $1.21 by 8.25%.

The chip company posted revenue of $16.72 billion in the period, versus consensus of $16.81B. ""Our first quarter business was impacted by weakening macroeconomic conditions and softening end market demand, which led customers to adjust their demand accordingly"" said Wendell Huang, VP and CFO of TSMC.

And reaction to the quarter and outlook has skewed negative with estimates for this year being taken down by several analysts.

Since the report, the EPS consensus has fallen from $5.57 to $5.33, representing a 19% drop in annual growth versus last year.

Meanwhile, projected revenues of $71.6 billion for this year are expected to come in 5.65% shy against 2022.

What's Driving the Slowdown As NVDA Soars?

This softening outlook comes after years of strong high-tech growth -- TSMC revenues have more than doubled since 2019 -- and may now pivot on three different catalysts.

First, geopolitical tensions with Taiwan have scared some investors away, including Warren Buffett who reportedly sold all his TSM shares bought last year.

Second, as Artificial Intelligence and ChatGPT fuel the current fortunes of companies like NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT), the chips they need fabricated by TSM run on a much longer planning and production cycle.

And now we are hearing about delays in the next micro-revolution in chip architecture. Engineers regularly design and build integrated circuits and transistors at the sub-10 nanometer scale (a billionth of a meter).

The next evolution includes designs for 3nm. But as DigiTimes reported last week, TSMC's major fabless clients may defer their 3nm chip rollouts. ""TSMC has obtained 3nm chip order commitments from vendors including AMD (AMD), NVIDIA, and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are all looking to defer the delivery of their 3nm generation devices,"" DigiTimes' Monica Chen and Jessie Shen reported, citing industry sources.

Thirdly, there is the complicated issue of semiconductor trade, tariffs, and subsidies. The WSJ is reporting that TSMC is pushing back on some subsidy conditions. With plans to invest $40 billion in two chip factories in Arizona, TSMC is arguing that some of the conditions Washington has attached to subsidies are ""unacceptable.""

As TSMC looks for up to $15 billion in government subsidies, The Wall Street Journal's Yang Jie reports the company is concerned about rules that could require it to share profits from the factories and provide detailed information about operations.

Bottom line on TSM: This key global player in semiconductor innovation is a core part of any tech investor's portfolio. But after blistering industry growth, the headwinds substantiate the pause.

2023-05-03 00:00:00+00:00,2 No-Brainer Stocks to Benefit From the $14 Trillion AI Revolution,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-no-brainer-stocks-to-benefit-from-the-%2414-trillion-ai-revolution,"The year 2023 has proven to be a charm for several artificial intelligence (AI) companies. On the one hand, the stock market has rewarded these companies with huge share price gains, while on the other hand, big enterprises have been chasing them for partnerships.
AI has become all-pervasive and has the ability to improve productivity and efficiency across sectors, industries, and functions. According to Ark Investment Management's Big Ideas 2023 report, AI software can rake in $14 trillion in revenue and build up $90 trillion worth of enterprise value by 2030.
Companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and UiPath (NYSE: PATH) stand to benefit dramatically from this AI revolution. Here's why these companies can prove attractive picks now.
Nvidia
Chipmaker Nvidia has had a dream run in 2023, with the stock rising by nearly 80% so far this year. While the company is exposed to inflationary and recessionary pressures in the short run, Nvidia's long-term prospects look bright thanks to its focus on developing AI chips and software.
The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot has triggered an AI arms race across the big tech titans of the world. Companies big and small are now fighting to capture a share of the AI market. And Nvidia seems well-positioned to benefit from this frenzy surrounding the AI megatrend.
It is said that Nvidia's A100 graphic chips (priced at around $10,000 each) played a key role in training ChatGPT, while more than 30,000 additional A100 chips will be required to commercialize ChatGPT completely. Nvidia has also launched another advanced AI chip -- the H100 (priced at $40,000 per chip) -- reportedly 4.5 times faster than A100. Surging demand for AI chips (priced 10 to 20 times higher than average gaming chips) is expected to translate into higher revenue and earnings for Nvidia in the coming years.
According to The New York Times, generative AI-based chatbots sometimes give ""irrelevant, nonsensical, or factually incorrect"" answers, also termed hallucinations. To mitigate these problems, Nvidia has developed the Nemo Guardrails software, which enables developers to integrate rules-based systems into chatbots.
If effective, this could help strengthen trust in generative AI, thereby further boosting demand for high-performance computing power and Nvidia's AI chips. Nvidia has estimated its total addressable AI market to be $600 billion. With Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) playing a major role in a range of AI and machine learning applications, Credit Suisse analysts consider Nvidia the ""leading silicon AI enabler.""
Since AI models require significant computational power, it could result in a GPU shortage in the coming months. This can further increase Nvidia's pricing power for its entire GPU portfolio -- leading to a higher top line and profitability for the company in coming quarters.
Nvidia is currently trading at nearly 45 times forward earnings, dramatically higher than the Nasdaq Composite's forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 19.8. However, the premium valuation seems justified, considering the company's leadership in cutting-edge AI technologies and its history of delivering robust financial results. Hence, it makes sense for retail investors to pick a small stake in this tech giant now.
UiPath
Leading robotic process automation player UiPath may not be the top-of-the-mind AI stock for many investors. However, unlike many tech companies banking on their potential to leverage AI in the future, UiPath already has well-proven AI and machine learning solutions (bots) that enable organizations to automate and scale repetitive processes and low-skill tasks without the help of a software engineer.
In May 2020, the company introduced an end-to-end hyper-automation platform that improves automation by leveraging advanced technologies like AI, process mining, and analytics.
With inflation making it more difficult for organizations to control expenses, automation can provide a way to save on expenses while improving productivity and reducing errors. This tailwind is apparent when we assess the company's results for fiscal 2023, ended Jan. 31. Revenue jumped 19% year over year to $1.06 billion, while annual recurring revenue soared by 30% to $1.2 billion.
The company ended the fiscal year with 1,785 customers spending $100,000 or more annually and 229 customers spending at least $1 million on its offerings. The company's Q4 dollar-based net retention rate of 123% is a testament to the company's successful cross-selling and upselling strategies. UiPath also has a very strong balance sheet with $1.8 billion in cash and negligible debt.
UiPath is not yet profitable and has been using stock-based compensation extensively to reward employees. However, this young company has been improving non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) operating margins and free-cash-flow margins. Hence, based on its leadership position in robotic process automation and its improving financials, the company can be considered an attractive pick now.

And so far, many big-tech names have been in the spotlight regarding the technology, including Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, and NVIDIA NVDA.
And as we can see in the chart below, all three stocks have provided market-beating returns in 2023, outperforming the S&P 500 handily.

But how does each company stack up currently? Let’s take a closer look.
NVIDIA
A big focus point of NVDA’s latest release was its Data Center results, which include its AI operations; Data Center revenue totaled $3.6 billion, growing 11% from the year-ago quarter. There were other strategic highlights within the Data Center segment, including a partnership with Deutsche Bank DB to further the use of AI within financial services.
Keep an eye on NVDA’s upcoming quarterly release expected on May 24th; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.92 indicates a Y/Y pullback of roughly 30%. Our consensus revenue estimate presently stands at $6.5 billion, reflecting a decline of 21% from the year-ago quarter.

NVDA shares certainly aren’t cheap at the moment, with the current 61.2X forward earnings multiple sitting well above the already steep 52.9X five-year median. Still, investors have had little issue forking up a premium for shares thanks to the long-term outlook of AI.

Microsoft
In an announcement that surprised some, it was revealed just this week that Microsoft is joining forces with Advanced Micro Devices AMD to fuel its push into AI, jointly developing a new AI processor. And this comes on the heels of MSFT’s significant investment into ChatGPT.
In its latest release, Cloud strength helped drive better-than-expected results, with Intelligent Cloud revenue growing 16% year-over-year to $22.1 billion. Total quarterly revenue totaled $52.8 billion, 4% ahead of expectations and improving 7% from the year-ago period.

Shares saw significant bullish activity post-earnings, closing 7% higher in the following trading session. This is illustrated by the green arrow in the chart below.

Alphabet
Alphabet unveiled its new conversational AI service, Bard, powered by its next-generation LaMDA (language model for dialogue applications). The service was launched in response to the snowballing popularity of ChatGPT.
Analysts have recently become bullish on GOOGL’s outlook, with earnings estimates drifting higher across all timeframes over the last several months.

In addition, shares are cheap on a relative basis, with the current 19.4X forward earnings multiple sitting well below the 25.9X five-year median and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average.

Bottom Line
With the rapid rise of interest in AI technology, it’s no surprise that several notable technology giants have joined the party.
While the technology is still in the early phases, the long-term potential has investors ecstatic, seeing a massive opportunity to reap some gains.
And so far, the three companies above – Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, and NVIDIA NVDA – are all scurrying to become the leader.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2023-05-08 00:00:00+00:00,See Which Of The Latest 13F Filers Holds NVIDIA,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/see-which-of-the-latest-13f-filers-holds-nvidia-6,"At Holdings Channel, we have reviewed the latest batch of the 23 most recent 13F filings for the 03/31/2023 reporting period, and noticed that NVIDIA Corp (Symbol: NVDA) was held by 13 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.
Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.
Having given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in NVDA positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:
FUND NEW POSITION? CHANGE IN SHARE COUNT CHANGE IN MARKET VALUE ($ IN 1000'S)
Perpetual Ltd NEW +22,952 +$6,375
Hemington Wealth Management Existing -11 +$297
PrairieView Partners LLC Existing UNCH +$16

Camden National Bank Existing -2,377 +$1,746
Aggregate Change: +64,285 +$378,533
In terms of shares owned, we count 4 of the above funds having increased existing NVDA positions from 12/31/2022 to 03/31/2023, with 7 having decreased their positions and 1 new position.
Looking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the NVDA share count in the aggregate among all of the funds which held NVDA at the 03/31/2023 reporting period (out of the 2,924 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of NVDA shares those same funds held back at the 12/31/2022 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for NVDA. We found that between these two periods, funds reduced their holdings by 3,681,016 shares in the aggregate, from 176,575,534 down to 172,894,518 for a share count decline of approximately -2.08%. The overall top three funds holding NVDA on 03/31/2023 were:

We'll keep following the latest 13F filings by hedge fund managers and bring you interesting stories derived from a look at the aggregate information across groups of managers between filing periods. While looking at individual 13F filings can sometimes be misleading due to the long-only nature of the information, the sum total across groups of funds from one reporting period to another can be a lot more revealing and relevant, providing interesting stock ideas that merit further research, like NVIDIA Corp (Symbol: NVDA).

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

So far in 2023, an investment in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has yielded outstanding results. What’s the long-term outlook for NVDA stock, though? If you believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is here to stay, then don’t be too surprised if the Nvidia share price is significantly higher in five years than it is today.
Some folks, including video game fanatics, might only think of Nvidia as a manufacturer of graphics processing units (GPUs). Yet, there’s more to Nvidia in the 2020s, as the company is making a name for itself in the AI hardware market.
In addition, Nvidia is boldly venturing into AI-related software. You just never know what Nvidia might do next, so be prepared for the company to continue innovating in multiple tech markets and providing ongoing value to the shareholders.
AI Supercomputers Enhance the Bull Case for NVDA Stock
Not long ago, OpenAI’s ChatGPT popularized generative AI platforms. However, ChatGPT and other chatbots are typically known to be power-intensive. Nvidia’s A100 chip is designed to address this need, as it delivers the intense computational power that generative AI platforms often require.
Nvidia stock traders should know that the A100 chip isn’t the company’s only foray into AI-compatible hardware, though. The company has also introduced its DGX supercomputers, which are now “running 24/7 at businesses across the world to refine data and process AI.” Moreover, CEO Jensen Huang even went so far as to call Nvidia’s DGX supercomputers “modern AI factories.”
Customers around the globe — in Japan, Ecuador, Sweden and elsewhere — are deploying Nvidia’s DGX H100 supercomputers “like AI factories to manufacture intelligence.” From healthcare to legal research, higher education to digital advertising and beyond, the use cases for Nvidia’s supercomputers continue to grow in 2023.
Nvidia Addresses a Major Issue With Generative AI
AI chatbots are now part of the mainstream culture. However, some might wonder whether these programs are reliable and safe. Indeed, skeptics of generative AI could point to instances of chatbots delivering responses that are inaccurate, inappropriate or even dangerous.
Nvidia is now offering a tool called NeMo Guardrails to address this problem. Jonathan Cohen, Nvidia’s vice president of applied research, describes NeMo Guardrails as an “open source developer tool kit to guide LLM-powered chatbots to be accurate, appropriate, on topic, and secure.”
NeMo Guardrails is designed to prevent the disclosure of confidential personal information. It can also help to reduce the dissemination of fictional/inaccurate statements. Perhaps, NeMo Guardrails will bridge the gap of trust among businesses that are distrustful of generative AI. Consequently, the adoption of NeMo Guardrails could bolster Nvidia’s customer count and top-line results.
So, Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 5 Years?
Nvidia never ceases to develop best-in-class gaming GPUs. At the same time, the company is creating groundbreaking hardware and software for AI applications. Clearly, Nvidia will continue to push the envelope and that’s exciting for the company’s customers and shareholders.
Nvidia’s leading-edge hardware will be the main driver of NVDA stock over the coming quarters. However, the company’s foray into AI-related software could also boost Nvidia’s revenue.
Therefore, I’m targeting $500 for the Nvidia stock price in five years. That’s an attainable objective, especially if Nvidia maintains its status as a leader in AI-friendly technology.

2023-05-15 00:00:00+00:00,"PC Market on the Mend, Benefits Abound for Tech ETFs",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pc-market-on-the-mend-benefits-abound-for-tech-etfs,"PCs, be they desktops or laptops, are no longer considered “high tech.” Rather, they’re essential parts of everyday life around the world. As a result, many investors don’t view this as the high-octane market segment it was several decades ago.
That doesn’t mean related investment opportunities are limited. Quite the contrary. While the PC market endured a slump over the past couple of years, some analysts believe it’s primed for a resurgence and that rebound could bring positive implications for exchange traded funds such as the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and the Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM).
Indeed, PCs represent one of the slowest growth corners of the tech sector. But consumers and businesses still need to periodically refresh their tech stack. That upgrade cycle could benefit plenty of members of the QQQ and QQQM rosters.
“If you assume that users replace their PCs every four years, which is the five-year pre-COVID average, that about 65% of the current PC installed base or roughly 760 million units is going to be due for a refresh in 2024 and 2025,” noted Morgan Stanley hardware IT analyst Erik Woodring.
Pulse on PC Market Outlook
For investors looking to capitalize on the PC upgrade cycle, QQQ and QQQM could be ideal options. Both ETFs allocate nearly 49% of their rosters to the tech sector. Within that are plenty of companies with direct ties to PC sales, including Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and to a lesser extent, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG).
Add to that, QQQ and QQQM are homes to an array of semiconductor equities with direct ties to the PC space, including Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). Perhaps adding to prospects of a PC market rebound are expectations that the bounce back will be driven by corporations.
“We think the replacements and upgrades in 2024 and 2025, will come from the commercial market. With 70% of our 2024 PC shipment growth coming from commercial entities. Commercial entities are much more regular when it comes to upgrades. And they need greater memory capacity and compute power to handle their ever-expanding workloads,” added Woodring.
The analyst also points to generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential driver of increased PC demand. Because that nascent industry requires increased, higher-cost computing power. That could boost a slew of QQQ and QQQM member firms, including chip makers such as AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).

2023-05-16 00:00:00+00:00,Could NVDA Exceed Q1 Expectations? Here’s What Rosenblatt Analyst Says,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/could-nvda-exceed-q1-expectations-heres-what-rosenblatt-analyst-says,"Chip giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will report its first-quarter financial results on Wednesday, May 24. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann expects NVDA to meet or exceed expectations in Q1 and Q2 due to the growth in the Data Center and Gaming segments. Mosesmann is bullish about NVDA, and his price target of $320 implies about 10.52% upside potential from current levels.
It’s worth highlighting that Nvidia is on fire in 2023, gaining about 98% year-to-date. The popularity of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and NVDA’s dominant positioning in the AI (Artificial Intelligence) space have given a boost to its stock price. 
Semiconductor stocks like NVDA suffered due to the moderation in end-market demand and inventory issues. However, the buzz around AI and the expected recovery in the Data Center and Gaming markets are likely to support NVDA stock. 
Wall Street expects NVDA to report revenue of $6.52 billion, which is in line with management’s expectations. Moreover, it reflects a sequential improvement from the previous quarter. During the Q4 conference, the company announced that quarter-over-quarter growth across each of its target markets and strong momentum in the Data Center and Gaming would lead to a sequential improvement in sales. 
Along with sales improvement, Mosesmann lauded NVDA’s positioning in the AI space. In a note dated May 10, the analyst said that he sees NVDA “driving the biggest technology inflection the world may have ever seen in transformational AI everywhere and in everything.” 
Also, NVDA’s EPS is expected to improve sequentially in Q1. Analysts expect NVDA to post earnings of $0.92 a share in Q1, compared to $0.88 in Q4. Nevertheless, EPS could decline on a year-over-year basis, reflecting tough comparisons.
What’s the Prediction for NVDA Stock?
NVDA’s leadership in the AI segment and expected recovery in end-market demand are positives, keeping analysts optimistic about its prospects. NVDA stock has 30 Buy, seven Hold, and one Sell recommendations for a Strong Buy consensus rating. 
However, due to the recent growth in NVDA stock, analysts’ average price target of $288.24 implies no upside potential.

2023-05-17 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-too-late-to-buy-nvidia-stock-8,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is showing no signs of stopping. Share prices of the graphics card specialist have nearly doubled in 2023 despite warning signs from peers such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which are struggling due to weak personal computer (PC) and data center markets.
Both AMD and Intel's exposure to the PC market led to declines in their revenue and earnings last quarter.
AMD reported a 9% year-over-year decline in revenue and a much bigger drop of 47% in earnings per share.
Intel turned in a similarly woeful performance with a 36% year-over-year drop in revenue. Chipzilla also swung to an adjusted loss of $0.04 per share as compared to a profit of $0.87 per share in the year-ago period.
But these reports haven't played spoilsport for Nvidia stock despite the company's exposure to the PC market. The stock maintained its terrific momentum, which will be put to the test when the company releases its fiscal 2024 first-quarter results on May 24.
Nvidia needs to pass next week's litmus test to sustain its hot rally
Nvidia stock trades at a whopping 166 times trailing earnings thanks to its red-hot 2023 rally. For comparison, the Nasdaq-100 index sports an average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27. Nvidia, therefore, needs to deliver a solid set of results next week.
The good part is that Wall Street already priced a steep decline into Nvidia's revenue and earnings based on the guidance that the company issued in February 2023. Revenue is expected to drop 21% year over year to $6.5 billion, while earnings could contract 32% year over year to $0.92 per share.
There are signs that Nvidia could deliver better-than-expected results thanks to the massive demand for the company's artificial intelligence (AI) chips, which carry a massive price tag. However, a lot will hinge on Nvidia's outlook.
Consensus estimates point toward a turnaround in the company's fortunes in the current quarter. Its Q2 fiscal 2024 (ending July 31, 2023) revenue is expected to increase 6.5% year over year to $7.1 billion, while earnings are expected to more than double over the prior-year period to $1.06 per share. If Nvidia is unable to match -- or exceed -- these numbers, it won't be surprising to see investors pressing the panic button.
After all, the stock is extremely expensive right now, and Nvidia's recent quarterly performances don't justify that valuation. Investors have been bidding up the stock based on the hype around AI applications and how they are going to create terrific demand for Nvidia's chips. So if the company doesn't provide evidence that AI is moving the needle significantly and misses Wall Street's forecasts, the stock's outstanding rally could come to a grinding halt.
At the same time, investors shouldn't forget that a third of Nvidia's revenue comes from PC-centric businesses -- gaming and professional visualization. With PC sales declining at an alarming pace and a recovery still some time away, there is a chance of Nvidia's results and guidance not being up to analysts' expectations.
In simpler terms, the combination of Nvidia's steep valuation and headwinds in a substantial part of its business makes it a risky bet right now. So it might be too late for investors who have missed the rally so far to buy Nvidia.
But a potential trick up the company's sleeve could help it sustain its momentum.
AI spending could be Nvidia's trump card
Nvidia gets nearly 60% of its revenue from selling chips deployed in data centers. The sizable influence of the data center business on Nvidia's top line could help it overcome the PC market's weakness, especially considering that companies involved in the development of AI applications made a beeline for its chips.
Nvidia's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU), which is used for training large language models and powers generative AI applications such as chatbots, sells for as much as $40,000. This robust pricing power is the reason AI is expected to substantially boost Nvidia's growth in the coming years, potentially adding billions of dollars to the company's revenue.
The good part is that investors may witness the impact of AI-related demand on Nvidia's business very soon. DigiTimes reports that the semiconductor bellwether reportedly placed more orders for data center chips at foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC. It is also worth noting that the demand for TSMC's 5nm chips, on which Nvidia's data center GPUs are based, increased by a big margin last quarter.
A closer look at how AI-related spending is booming gives us more reasons to believe that demand for Nvidia's expensive AI chips could be high. Market research firm IDC estimates that spending on AI-centric systems could increase 27% this year and hit $154 billion. More importantly, this momentum is expected to continue long term. IDC expects AI spending to increase by 27% a year through 2026 and to exceed $300 billion a year.
Meanwhile, the AI chip market alone is expected to grow to a whopping $227 billion a year by 2032 from just $17 billion last year, according to Precedence Research. Nvidia is the leading player in this market, with an estimated share of 95% of the market for GPUs used for machine learning applications, according to New Street Research. So it won't be surprising to see AI turning out to be a long-term catalyst for the stock.
What should investors do?
Nvidia's valuation suggests that it might be too late to buy the stock now given the potential headwinds discussed above. But if the company turns in a solid set of results and starts growing once again thanks to AI, growth stock investors should consider grabbing it. That's because Nvidia's forward P/E ratio of 64, which is less than half its trailing earnings multiple, indicates that its bottom line is set for solid growth.
More specifically, Nvidia's earnings are expected to jump 37% this year to $4.58 per share. The momentum is expected to continue in the next fiscal year as well with an estimated jump of 33% to $6.11 per share.
The company's solid pricing power in AI chips and robust demand for those chips could help Nvidia deliver such impressive growth. So if Nvidia regains its mojo thanks to AI, the stock could continue heading higher, in which case there's still an opportunity for investors to ride along.

Shares in chip design software company Synopsys SNPS.O shares ended up 8.7% after it forecast better-than-expected third-quarter profit estimates, saying increased use of AI and automation boosted its business.
Nvidia shares were up 5.0%, while the Philadelphia semiconductor index gained 3.2%.
Micron's shares climbed 4.1% after announcing it would invest up to 500 billion yen ($3.70 billion) in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology in Japan in the next few years with Japanese government support.
Japan's President Fumio Kishida asked executives from companies, such as Micron, Intel Corp INTC.O and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) 2330.TW, to invest in Japan ahead of a three-day Group of Seven (G7) summit in Hiroshima, where member countries will discuss what they see as China's economically coercive policies and its accumulation of sensitive technology.
Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh put Thursday's rally down to continued investor interest in the emergence of artificial intelligence as the hottest new technology, more so than the news from Japan.
""While it's encouraging that companies and countries are working together to expand capacity, for investors when companies are building new plants, it's generally not rewarding in the short term because that's where all the free cash flow goes,"" said Forrest.
The money manager, who also cited Synopsys results as a positive sign for the chip sector, however, noted that investors see chips as the part of the AI story they can buy into today as ""there's no one company you can buy that's the lynchpin"" for AI.
AMD shares were up 4.0% while Intel added 2.8%. Nvidia, which is up 116% so far in 2023, is due to report quarterly results on May 24.
Nvidia shares hit highest level since December 2021 while Micron shares touched highest point since June 2022.
Trailing behind the chip sector, the S&P 500 technology index .SPLRCT was up 2.1% and the S&P 500 growth index .IGX rose at a slower 1.0% pace.

NVIDIA Declares $0.04 Dividend
On February 22, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share ($0.16 annualized). Shareholders of record as of March 8, 2023 received the payment on March 29, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.04 per share.
At the current share price of $312.64 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.05%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.19%, the lowest has been 0.02%, and the highest has been 0.50%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.12 (n=237).
The current dividend yield is 1.10 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.09. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

2023-05-23 00:00:00+00:00,Time to Buy Snowflake or Nvidia Stock as Earnings Approach?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/time-to-buy-snowflake-or-nvidia-stock-as-earnings-approach,"Tech innovators Nvidia (NVDA) and Snowflake's (SNOW) quarterly results on May 24 will highlight this week’s earnings lineup.  As two of the more popular tech stocks investors are certainly wondering if shares of NVDA or SNOW can keep rising.
Both stocks have rebounded mightily this year especially Nvidia which has soared +111% to easily top the very respectable performances of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Snowflake’s +22% YTD performance has also edged the broader indexes.
Recent developments surrounding both companies’ endeavors into Artificial Intelligence could keep investor sentiment high. With that being said, let’s see if now is a good time to buy Nvidia or Snowflake stock for more upside as earnings approach.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Nvidia Q1 Preview
The rebound among many chip stocks and the broader technology sector has been led by Nvidia’s strong performance. This makes Nvidia’s first-quarter report and outlook crucial after such an extensive rally over the first five months of the year.
AI Developments: Recent developments of a joint collaboration with Dell Technologies (DELL) on generative artificial intelligence (AI) are intriguing and could help the guidance side of Nvidia’s Q1 report. Project Helix as the venture is called will assist businesses with using AI models to deliver better customer service, market intelligence, and enterprise research among other capabilities.
According to Zacks estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 earnings are projected at $0.92 per share, which would be a -32% decrease from Q1 2023 EPS of $1.36 a share. Although Nvidia is still dealing with a tougher operating environment amid high inflation its stock tends to pop after beating earnings expectations, especially when offering favorable guidance.
To that point, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) indicates Nvidia could beat bottom-line expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q1 EPS at $0.94. On the top line, sales are expected to be $6.52 billion, down -21% from the prior-year quarter. 

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Snowflake Q1 Preview
Software solutions provider Snowflake has commanded a premium in its realm similar to how Nvidia has among semiconductors and visual computing technologies. Snowflake’s data could capabilities and services have fostered the support of many notable investors. More upside in Snowflake stock will still rely on its Q1 results and guidance.
AI Developments: Notably, the database architect appears to be working on an intriguing artificial intelligence venture of its own with Snowflake reportedly in talks to buy AI search startup Neeva. Many analysts are very keen on the possibilities of the potential deal which could elevate and expand the software Snowflake provides along with its audience and end markets.
The Zacks Consensus for Snowflake’s Q1 earnings is $0.05 per share a seemingly small but 400% increase from Q1 2022 EPS of $0.01. The Zacks ESP indicates Snowflake should reach its quarterly earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate also at $0.05 a share. Sales for the quarter are expected to be up 44% YoY at $607.57 million.

Growth & Outlook
Despite Q1 EPS expected to be down from the prior-year quarter, Nvidia’s current fiscal 2024 earnings are still forecasted to rise 36% at $4.54 a share compared to EPS of $3.34 in the company’s FY23. Even better, FY25 earnings are projected to climb another 33% to $6.03 per share. Sales are projected to rise 11% in FY24 and jump another 25% in FY25 to $37.42 billion.

Pivoting to Snowflake, earnings are expected to skyrocket 132% in its current fiscal 2024 to $0.58 a share compared to EPS of $0.25 in FY23. More impressive, fiscal 2025 earnings are anticipated to climb another 87% to $1.08 per share. On the top line, sales are projected to soar 39% in FY24 and climb another 39% in FY25 to $3.99 billion.

Bottom Line
Artificial Intelligence could certainly boost Nvidia and Snowflake’s expansion capabilities with both stocks landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. Further guidance on their AI prospects could extend this year’s rally but at least reaching Q1 EPS expectations and offering a favorable outlook will be just as important.

2023-05-25 00:00:00+00:00,3 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to New Heights in 2023,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-before-they-soar-to-new-heights-in-2023,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Semiconductor stocks are on a bull run, as demand explodes with the rapid growth of artificial intelligence applications and platforms. Investors are pouring money into semiconductor stocks at a fevered pace with the expectation that they will take us on a quantum leap forward with AI technology that includes chatbots, digital assistants and robots.
Since January, the stocks of some leading semiconductor companies have more than doubled as the hype builds. Accounting firm Deloitte has issued a report forecasting that the global semiconductor industry will grow to $1 trillion in annual revenues by 2030, doubling in less than a decade. As the entire semiconductor industry explodes, I’ll look at three semiconductor stocks to buy before they soar to new heights in 2023.
AMD Advanced Micro Devices $119.04
AVGO Broadcom $708.70
MRVL Marvell Technology $47.78
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have been breaking out lately, having gained 23% over the last month. The stock of this leading semiconductor producer has been rising on reports that the company is getting more involved with artificial intelligence. There have been media reports in recent weeks that AMD is partnering with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on the development of a new AI processor. There have also been articles saying that AMD is working on a new superchip that could have broad applications in AI.
Artificial intelligence hype aside, AMD stock has also benefitted from the company’s strong financial performance. The company managed to beat Wall Street expectations in its most recent quarter despite slumping personal computer sales weighing on its business. Following the company’s Q1 print, AMD stock received several analyst upgrades, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) raising its price target on the shares to $120 from $105.
Broadcom (AVGO)

Shares of semiconductor company Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) have also been on an upswing lately, gaining 23% through nearly five months of the year. However, AVGO stock has not had the huge run that competing semi stocks such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has more than doubled year to date, have enjoyed. This suggests that Broadcom’s stock could have more room to run. The stock isn’t cheap at nearly $700 a share. But it offers a quarterly dividend that yields 2.7%, which is better than most other semiconductor securities.
AVGO stock also just got a huge catalyst with news that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has signed a deal with Broadcom to have the chipmaker develop 5G radio frequency components in the U.S. The exact value of the deal wasn’t revealed, though Apple said it is a multibillion dollar arrangement and part of its commitment to invest $430 billion in the American economy. Analysts were quick to praise the deal with Apple, saying it positions Broadcom, and its stock, for future growth.
Marvell Technology (MRVL)

Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a semiconductor stock that is recovering after a difficult decline last year. So far in 2023, MRVL stock is up 28%. However, it’s still 15% lower than where it was at 12 months ago and is down 50% from the all-time high the stock price reached in December 2021. There is reason to be bullish on Marvell’s stock though as the company continues to focus on developing chips for the fast-growing automotive industry (electric vehicles) and the AI sector.
For its fiscal 2023 earnings, Marvell Technology managed to grow its revenue by 33% year over year to $5.9 billion. The company isn’t profitable and reported a net loss of $164 million for fiscal 2023. However, that was a major improvement from a loss of $421 million recorded a year earlier. The company’s free cash flow rose 69% to $1.07 billion. Marvell has said it sees future growth in not just automotive and AI, but also in cloud computing and 5G mobile networks that use its semiconductors.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Accenture plc (ACN). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>

Apple’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+16.3% vs. +15.8%). The company’s revenues are expected to grow year over year. Growing services subscriber base and a strong liquidity position are key catalysts for Apple’s prospects.

However, Apple expects the March quarter’s year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to that of the December quarter due to unfavorable forex. For iPhone, Apple expects the March quarter’s year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate relative to the December quarter’s year-over-year revenue growth.

For Mac and iPad, revenues are expected to decline in double digits on a year-over-year basis due to challenging comparison and macroeconomic headwinds. Services revenue growth is expected to be negatively impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions, as well as weakness in digital advertising and gaming.

(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)

Shares of Chevron have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (-10.1% vs. +1.7%). The company was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially. The company’s high oil price sensitivity is a concern too.

Moreover, the supermajor’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of energy produced. However, Chevron is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up.

America’s No. 2 energy firm’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin. As a reflection of these positives, we saw CVX’s EPS jump 132% in 2022.

(You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>>)

Accenture’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Consulting Services industry over the year-to-date period (+77.0% vs. +46.8%). The company has been steadily gaining traction in its outsourcing and consulting businesses backed by high demand for services that can improve operating efficiencies and save costs. The company has been strategically enhancing its cloud and digital marketing suite through buyouts and partnerships.

The company’s strong operating cash flow has helped it reward its shareholders in the form of dividend payments and share repurchases, and pursue opportunities in areas that show true potential. On the flip side, pricing pressure due to significant competition from strong companies like Genpact, Cognizant and Infosys, remains a concern.

Global presence exposes it to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Buyout-related integration risks continues to remain a concern. Partly due to these headwinds, Accenture shares are down 4.1% in the past year.

2023-05-30 00:00:00+00:00,Did Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) Miss the Most Disruptive Innovation of All?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/did-cathie-woods-ark-innovation-etf-arkk-miss-the-most-disruptive-innovation-of-all,"Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation Fund (NYSEARCA:ARKK) bills itself as investing in “disruptive innovation.” Unfortunately for ARKK ETF holders, it seems that ARKK missed out on at least the early stages of the rise of the most innovative and disruptive technological advance in recent times -- artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI, in particular. 
Why Generative AI Should be in a Disruptive Innovation Fund
It’s hard to argue that the rise of AI, and specifically generative AI, isn’t the most disruptive technological breakthrough that we’ve witnessed in some time. For those unfamiliar with the term, Roundhill Investments defines generative AI as “artificial intelligence models capable of creating new, unique content (i.e., images, text, audio) by learning patterns and structures from existing data.”
Consumer-facing generative AI apps like OpenAI's ChatGPT have gone viral and reached critical mass at an unprecedented rate. After launching in November 2022, ChatGPT hit 100 million users a mere two months later, becoming the fastest-growing application of all time.  
And it’s not just ChatGPT -- investors and the public alike have been amazed by OpenAI’s Dall-E software, which can create elaborate images from text-based prompts. Recently, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) unveiled its new Firefly generative AI engine, which enables users to edit images in Photoshop using just a text-based prompt.
While the average investor can’t invest in privately-held OpenAI, there are plenty of ways for investors to gain exposure to this type of innovation. For example, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) owns a large stake in OpenAI. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has its own answer to ChatGPT called Bard.
The aforementioned Adobe is also publicly traded. Meanwhile, ChatGPT and other generative AI applications are powered by Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) semiconductors. Unfortunately, none of these names are found in the ARK Innovation ETF. 
Conspicuous in Their Absence
ARKK stock is up nearly 30% year-to-date, so it’s hard to criticize its performance so far in 2023. However, the leaders in generative AI mentioned above are glaring in their omission from a fund that is focused on innovative and disruptive technology, and many of these names are up even more than ARKK.
Nvidia is up roughly 180% year-to-date, far more than ARKK. Last week, Nvidia reported blowout earnings and released show-stopping guidance for the current quarter, and the stock gained ~24% on the day, tacking on $184 billion to its market cap. To put things into perspective, Nvidia essentially added more than the entire market cap of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or Nike (NYSE:NKE) to its valuation in a single day.
As mentioned above, Nvidia is not owned by ARKK. Making matters worse for ARKK holders is the fact that ARKK had the prescience to own Nvidia long before it became the hottest name in the market. ARKK exited its Nvidia position over the course of last November to this January, missing out on the bulk of its massive year-to-date run. 
In fairness to ARK Invest, the firm does own Nvidia in smaller funds like the ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ) and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW), but there’s no way around the fact that they missed out on a massive gain in its flagship fund. 
A Matter of Valuation?
In an interview with CNBC this past February, Cathie Wood said that the fund sold Nvidia as part of the process of “consolidating around their highest-conviction names” and that part of the reason that Nvidia didn’t make the cut was that its valuation is very high. Wood isn’t wrong about this valuation per se -- after its monster earnings report, Nvidia now trades at a nosebleed 50 times forward earnings and 40 times consensus 2025 earnings. 
It’s not a bad thing to take profits from some of your winners and consolidate them into your new best ideas, but unfortunately, the timing of this move didn’t work out in ARK’s favor. Furthermore, selling Nvidia based on its valuation makes some sense, although when looking at ARKK’s other top holdings, it doesn’t appear that valuation is a primary concern. 
Below is an overview of ARKK's top 10 holdings. Click on the image to learn more.
As you can see, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the fund’s top holding, with a large weighting of nearly 11%. Wood is a longtime and prominent Tesla bull, and this pick has been a big winner for ARKK, as Tesla has returned 86% year-to-date, driving a large part of ARKK's overall gain. However, Tesla also trades at an expensive P/E multiple of 55 and a forward P/E of 39 times. While this is slightly cheaper than Nvidia, they are still clearly in the same ballpark, and both trade at valuations well above the broader market. 
Meanwhile, other top-five holdings like Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) and Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) are not yet profitable.  
ARKK does own another AI play, UiPath (NYSE:PATH), in its top 10 holdings. UiPath specializes in workflow automation and trades at 46 times forward earnings and 41 times 2025 consensus earnings. So, again, it's another example of a holding where the valuation is not all that different from Nvidia’s.
Top 10 holding Crispr (NASDAQ:CRSP), focused on gene editing technology, is not yet profitable but trades at 50 times sales (a premium to Nvidia’s price-to-sales multiple of 36). 
As touched on above, Nvidia isn’t the only name involved in generative AI that is missing from ARKK’s portfolio. The fund doesn’t hold any semiconductor names, and to put it simply, analysts from Susquehanna recently called semiconductors the ""picks and shovels"" of the AI gold rush. None of the mega-cap tech names like Microsoft, Alphabet, or Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which are all pushing their own advances in AI technology, are present. Software names like Adobe or Hubspot (NYSE:HUBS), which are integrating AI into their platforms, aren't present either.
Within enterprise software, however, in addition to UiPath, the fund has been buying Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), another stock that has benefited from surging investor interest in AI.
Further, the smaller ARK Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF holds a 4.4% position in Nvidia. It takes a bit of a different approach to artificial intelligence and owns many industrial names that are incorporating robotics and AI technology into their products ranging from agriculture and construction machinery giants like Deere (NYSE:DE) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) to defense companies like Kratos (NASDAQ:KTOS) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). As well, the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF has a 1.6% position in Nvidia, as well as small positions in Microsoft and Palantir.
Is ARKK Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
According to the collective ratings of 398 analysts, ARKK comes in as a Hold. 49.75% of ratings are Buys, 40.45% are Holds, and 9.8% are Sells. The average ARKK stock price target of $49.81 implies 25.1% upside potential.

In summary, Cathie Wood and ARKK Invest certainly deserve credit for a strong rebound of nearly 30% so far in 2023. Still, you can’t help but feel that they missed out on perhaps the most ""disruptive innovation"" of all by selling Nvidia just before ChatGPT took generative AI mainstream.
Further, the fund doesn't have much other exposure to the other pioneers in the space, whether it’s other semiconductor companies or tech mega caps that have emerged as the early leaders in the AI revolution. At this point in time, based on its current holdings, it has to be said that ARKK doesn’t look well-positioned to truly capture the upside of the next era of revolutionary technological innovation.

In fairness to ARK Invest, the firm does own Nvidia in smaller funds like the ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ) and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW), but there’s no way around the fact that they missed out on a massive gain in its flagship fund.","Meanwhile, ChatGPT and other generative AI applications are powered by Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) semiconductors.

2023-05-31 00:00:00+00:00,US STOCKS-Wall St falls as labor data spurs rate hike jitters before debt ceiling vote,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-st-falls-as-labor-data-spurs-rate-hike-jitters-before-debt-ceiling-vote-0,"By Herbert Lash and Shreyashi Sanyal
May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday as a deal to raise the federal debt ceiling headed toward a crucial vote in Congress, while unexpectedly strong labor market data rattled investors who fear the Federal Reserve might hike interest rates again in June.
The House of Representatives is expected to vote in the evening on a bill to lift the $31.4 trillion debt limit, a critical step to avoid a destabilizing default that could come early next week without congressional approval.
House passage would send the bill to the Senate, where debate could stretch to the weekend, just before the June 5 date when the government could start to run out of money.
But most analysts foresee the bill's approval and U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he expected the debt ceiling bill on his desk by next Monday.
""The bond market liked that there was some fiscal discipline and the equity market liked that it's not going to hurt growth,"" said Brad Conger, deputy chief investment officer at Hirtle Callaghan & Co in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.
""I don't think we could have asked for a better outcome.""
However, equity valuations are stretched considering interest rates are high, the economy is slowing and inflation needs to decline further, Conger said.
""Quite frankly, if we're really slowing down, the market is not offering a free lunch,"" he said. ""It's going to be a struggle if inflation is not perceived to be ebbing, which is where we are.""
The Labor Department reportedthat U.S. job openings unexpectedly rose in April, pointing to persistent strength in a labor market that suggests pressure on both wages and inflation.
Futures traders raised to 70% the probability of a 25 basis points hike at the Fed's June 13-14 policy meeting. But that likelihood fell to about 32% after comments by Fed officials who are leaning to what some call a ""hawkish pause."" FEDWATCH
Fed Governor and vice chair nominee Philip Jefferson said skipping a rate hike in two weeks would provide policymakers time to see more data before making a decision. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker also said on Wednesday that for now he is inclined to support a ""skip"" in rate hikes.
""The recent economic data has not really favored a pause in rate hikes,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""But we've had a number of Fed governors coming out this afternoon and saying a pause is either likely or certainly possible.""
The Labor Department's closely watched May unemployment report, due on Friday, could decide whether a rate hike occurs.
The major indices pared some losses after the comments by Fed officials.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 131.88 points, or 0.4%, to 32,910.9, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 25.39 points, or 0.60%, to 4,180.13 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 82.14 points, or 0.63%, to 12,935.29.
Technology-led gains have put the Nasdaq on track for its best performance in May since 2020.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said U.S. banks' total deposits declined by a record 2.5% in the first quarter after two large bank failures.
The S&P 500 financial sector index .SPSY fell, with banks .SPXBK taking the brunt of the decline.
Advance Auto Parts Inc AAP.N plunged, falling the most on the S&P 500, after the auto parts retailer cut its full-year forecasts.
Other autoparts companies including Genuine Parts Co GPC.N, Autozone AZO.N and O'Reily Automotive ORLY.O also fell.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co HPE.N skidded after missing Wall Street estimates for second-quarter revenue.
Nvidia Corp's NVDA.O shares fell after hitting a record high that briefly boosted its market value above $1 trillion on Tuesday, fueled by bets on the AI boom.
Intelwas the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 as the chipmaker said it was on track to hit the upper end of its second-quarter revenue forecast.

In this episode of ETF Spotlight, I speak with Dave Mazza, Chief Strategy Officer, and Matthew Kanterman, Director of Research, at Roundhill Investments, about investing in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).
ChatGPT’s astronomical popularity has accelerated the arms race among the tech giants. Nvidia NVDA has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the gold rush as the chip giant is seeing explosive demand for its cutting-edge GPUs used in generative AI applications.
Google dominated the search market over the last few decades, but the launch of new AI-powered Bing by Microsoft has reignited the search war. We discuss what is at stake for these tech behemoths.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that generative AI technology could drive a 7%, or about $7 trillion, increase in global GDP over a 10-year period.
The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (CHAT) is the first ETF globally to focus on generative AI technology. Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet GOOGL and AMD AMD are among the top holdings in the actively managed fund.
ETFs that invest in companies contributing to the development and deployment of AI technologies have seen immense investor interest in the past few weeks.
The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ and the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF ROBO are the most popular products, while the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF IRBO is one of the cheapest funds in the space.

June 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday after a labor market report showing moderating wage growth in May indicated the Federal Reserve may skip a rate hike in two weeks, while investors welcomed a Washington deal that avoided a catastrophic debt default.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq index .IXICsurged a 13-month intraday high and posted its sixth-straight week of gains that mark its best winning streak since January 2020.
U.S. job growth accelerated in May but a surge in the unemployment rate to a seven-month high of 3.7% as more people looked for employment indicated labor market conditions were easing, the Labor Department said.
The jump in the unemployment rate from a 53-year low of 3.4% in April reflected a drop in household employment and a rise in the overall workforce. A bigger labor pool is easing pressure on businesses to raise wages and helping decelerate inflation.
""While it appears to be a hot number on the actual number of people employed, the wage rate is not increasing as fast,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. ""That is a softening effect and is this the mythical soft landing? Looks like that.""
But some pointed to the much hotter-than-expected jobs data as a sign the Fed still has not yet tamed inflation.
""Our view is and has been that the market is completely wrong on assessing what the Federal Reserve is doing,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Hermes in New York.
""The market's perception is that this economy was going to cool, inflation was going to collapse and the Fed was going to turn around and start cutting interest rates. That's wrong.""
Fed funds futures showed a 66.6% probability that the Fed will hold rates steady in two weeks, down from 79.6% on Thursday, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.
Markets now await data on key consumer prices a day before the Fed's rate decision.
The Senate passing a bill late on Thursday to lift the government's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling avoided what would have been a catastrophic, first-ever default.
Passage of the vote eased investor concerns as Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE volatility index .VIX, fell to its lowest since November 2021.
Unofficially,
All 11 S&P 500 sectors advanced, with the materials index .SPLRCMleading and the consumer discretionary sector .SPLRCD, housing Amazon, close behind.
Nvidia Corp NVDA.O slid for a second day after briefly entering on Wednesday the elite club of megacap stocks valued at $1 trillion or more on hopes artificial intelligence will deliver significant future returns.
But Nvidia's almost 170% rise year to date highlights investors face by a market dominated by the outperformance of megacaps while most other companies tread water.
""Nobody’s really explained to me how they’re going to make any money from it,"" said Michael Landsberg,” chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management in Punta Gorda, Florida. ""A company like Nvidia going up so much in such a short period of time, that doesn't make any rational sense.""

2023-06-06 00:00:00+00:00,"Got $2,500? This Dirt Cheap Growth Stock Could Be Worth Buying Hand Over Fist",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/got-%242500-this-dirt-cheap-growth-stock-could-be-worth-buying-hand-over-fist,"If you're looking to invest $2,500 somewhere it'll grow, but you're a bit leery of buying an increasingly overpriced and hyped-up growth stock like Nvidia, Fulgent Genetics (NASDAQ: FLGT) might be up your alley. Its shares are priced for bargain hunters, and its growth prospects are plentiful.
Of course, it's usually the case that a promising company selling cheap has experienced a few bumps in the road, and the same is true for this one. Let's examine its recent performance to see if that matters and whether it'd be a fitting addition to your portfolio.
What's happening and why
Let's get all the bad news out of the way at once: Fulgent's shares have declined 25% in the past 12 months, and its quarterly revenue fell by 47% in the same period, arriving at $66.1 million in sales for the first quarter of 2023. Whereas the company spent the first part of the pandemic raking in millions by offering coronavirus diagnostic testing services, demand for COVID testing is plummeting, and it (hopefully) won't be recovering anytime soon. So that leaves Fulgent with the task of expanding its other sources of revenue, like for its genetic testing services.
In that vein, it's planning to onboard new testing panels to add to its collection of more than 900 via a combination of organic capacity increases and bolt-on acquisitions. Cancer diagnostics will be an area of special focus.
Plus, since its acquisition of a pharma company in late 2022, it's also developing a drug in phase 1 clinical trials to treat head and neck cancers, and potentially pancreatic cancers too. So eventually, it will likely become a biotech using data from its oncology genetic testing business to power its research and development (R&D) pipeline of oncology medicines. And management thinks that will accelerate the drug development process, saving money along the way.
Since Q4 2022, the company has been unprofitable due to the further erosion of its coronavirus revenue and the ramp-up of its core genetic testing services, which in the first quarter of this year brought in 150% more revenue than a year prior, topping $62.7 million. Soon enough, COVID testing revenue will be negligible, as it only brought in around $3.5 million. Given that it has $871.3 million in cash and marketable securities, minimal debt, and that it only used $9.9 million in cash in Q1 of 2023, its finances aren't under any immediate pressure.
Now's an appealing time to start a position
Management is expecting sales of $250 million for 2023, which indicates that the rest of the year is going to look a lot like the first quarter. In other words, the transitional period is going to be ending by the start of 2024, when the company's pace of growth will start to reflect its rapid penetration of the markets it plans to operate in for the long term.
And that is likely to coincide with the market recognizing that Fulgent is a potent growth stock once again. But at the moment, its valuation is still at rock bottom.
Fulgent's price-to-book (P/B) multiple is a paltry 0.8, which basically means the company's valuation is so low that the total value of all of its shares outstanding (its market cap) is 20% less than the value of its tangible assets. And when considering that the average P/B of the biotech industry is 7.6, this stock looks like a huge bargain.
The biggest risk of an investment right now is that the shares will continue to tumble amid the uncertain market conditions. As an unprofitable biotech, Fulgent is particularly vulnerable to investor selling pressure, and you might need to wait a while before your $2,500 actually starts to grow significantly.
This isn't a stock that you should consider as a safe investment, even though its fundamentals are currently sound, and its future looks relatively bright. But if you can hold on to your shares for a few years, there's a solid chance that its valuation will rise alongside its revenue, and eventually its earnings.

2023-06-07 00:00:00+00:00,Will ChatGPT Disrupt Wall Street Algos?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-chatgpt-disrupt-wall-street-algos,"If you are an investor or an active day trader, you likely know of Renaissance Technologies.

This is the giant hedge fund ""accidentally"" started by mathematician Jim Simons in 1978, initially with the name Monemetrics.

In the Wikipedia entry for Simons, we find this...

Due to the long-term aggregate investment returns of Renaissance and its Medallion Fund, Simons is described as the ""greatest investor on Wall Street,"" and more specifically ""the most successful hedge fund manager of all time.""

How did he achieve this? It's all about the math.

In the video that accompanies this article, I explain my first encounters with algo trading in the early 2000s and what I learned from the revolution created by Simons. I also give a recent update from another “rocket scientist who does markets” about whether and how ChatGPT changes the algo game.

Right now, let’s continue with the Renaissance, or RenTech, story that gave us trading algos…

The Secret Life of a Topologist

At MIT in the early 1960s, Simons specialized in differential geometry and the topology of manifolds, the study of curved spaces. When the young graduate student needed some extra money, he took a job in 1964 with the National Security Agency and Department of Defense to break Russian codes.

As a “code breaker” between 1964 and 1968, Simons was also allowed to work half of his time on mathematical problems of his own interest. And he taught mathematics at MIT and Harvard.

After being forced to leave the Institute for Defense Analysis due to his public opposition to the Vietnam War, he joined the faculty at Stony Brook University in 1968 and became chairman of the mathematics department, at only age 30. Advisors had encouraged him to go to Berkeley and work under Shing-Shen Chern, a professor who also had great interest in differential geometry.

Eventually, the two would collaborate on a groundbreaking theory now called the Chern-Simons form. Without knowing much about physics, his and Chern’s work became a mathematical tool now used extensively in theoretical physics. From a 2000 article by Hal Lux in Institutional Investor magazine…

""Chern-Simons pervades a whole class of theories that underlie our fundamental view of the observable world,"" says Brandeis University physicist Stanley Deser, an expert on supergravity, a discipline of quantum theory that studies elementary particles and their interaction.

Simons would subsequently contribute to the development of string theory by providing a theoretical framework to combine geometry and topology with quantum field theory.

Code-Breaker and Space Fan Goes to Wall Street

Simons left Stony Brook in 1978 and started Monemetrics to begin trading currencies. He’d always been interested in business, but found commodities more fascinating than stocks. At first, he didn’t even apply the mathematical modeling that was his expertise to currency data.

But once he realized the power of mathematics in markets, he never looked back. By 1982, the Monemetrics name was changed to Renaissance Technologies and he started hiring other mathematicians to help him create models.

RenTech went on to specialize in systematic trading using quantitative models derived from mathematical and statistical analysis. They created the mold for algorithms to make investment gains from market inefficiencies and pattern recognition.

And one of its major sources of innovation was the fact that Simons would only hire quantitative specialists with non-financial backgrounds, including computer scientists, mathematicians, physicists, signal processing experts and statisticians. He never wanted the scent of Wall Street to foul up his data modeling.

Simons Was Semi-AI Before NVIDIA

One of the wonderful elements of stories about great mathematicians like Simons who have applied their knowledge to complex but practical problems is how many of them did it without sophisticated software.

Picture Simons cranking out complicated theorems with pencil on paper, or chalk on blackboards. And then when he learned to harness market data to do pattern recognition and create models, he still just had “ancient” computing power that only spit out signals to execute trades. The automated algo part was barely in its infancy in the 1980s.

Now the “machine” of markets has taken over. And it’s only going to accelerate. In the video, I explain where and when you can still compete with the algos in trading.

I also highlight three stocks and companies that have made a difference for investors who’ve followed me…

Synopsys SNPS is the $65 billion maker of electronic design automation (EDA) software for the semiconductor and electronics industries. Synopsys offers a full suite of products used in the logic synthesis and functional verification phases of chip design, including a broad array of reusable design building blocks.

I recommended Synopsys shares in March under $375 as part of my first report on ChatGPT where I explained the AI revolution wrought by NVIDIA NVDA and AMD GPU chips. You can get a copy of that report by emailing Ultimate@Zacks.com and tell ‘em Cooker sent you.

In the video, I also mention Cadence Design Systems CDNS as another provider of systems design enablement (SDE) for chip makers. Cadence calls their proprietary brand of solutions Intelligent System Design (ISD) and Jensen Huang’s NVIDIA is a key customer because he values their capabilities to simulate before manufacture.

Synopsys and Cadence are basically a ""duopoly"" in the software realm that semiconductor companies need to bring their ideas to life with simulation first before engineered solutions go to the foundry. This is critically important as NVIDIA and all its competitors are diving into the microscopic sub-5 nanometer world of integrated circuits.

Be sure to watch the video to hear astrophysicist Michael Hobson from eyeQ talk about the impact of ChatGPT on his statistical models and algorithms for trading.

2023-06-08 00:00:00+00:00,Want to Invest in Republican or Democratic Stocks? Check Out These 2 ETFs,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/want-to-invest-in-republican-or-democratic-stocks-check-out-these-2-etfs,"If you feel like everything has become increasingly political in the United States in recent years, you probably aren’t alone. Now, even investing is, in some ways, becoming political. Many consumers expect brands to have a stance on polarizing issues, and an increasing number of ETFs have been launched in recent years with the intent of allowing people to invest in companies that they believe are aligned with their political viewpoints (i.e., Republican or Democratic).
Whether this is a good or bad idea, or good or bad for the country, is a topic I will leave for the reader to decide. For now, let’s take a look at two such ETFs, each representing an opposing side of the aisle -- the Point Bridge GOP Stock Tracker ETF (BATS:MAGA) and the Democratic Large Cap Core ETF (NASDAQ:DEMZ). 
Two Sides of the Same Coin
These ETFs ostensibly exist to enable investors to invest based on their political viewpoints, but what does that mean in practice? 
Point Bridge Capital says that it “allows you to invest in companies that align with your Republican political beliefs.” It does this by investing in up to 150 S&P 500 (SPX) companies “whose employees and political action committees (PACs) are highly supportive of Republican candidates.” The holdings are equally weighted so that smaller S&P 500 companies are not crowded out by the largest companies. 
What does this look like on the ground? MAGA owns 150 stocks, none of which have more than a 1% weighting, so this is actually a very diversified fund. Its top 10 holdings make up a minuscule 8.4% of assets. Below, you’ll find an overview of MAGA’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
Holdings come from across a wide array of industries. For example, the nominal top holding is pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), while homebuilder Pultegroup (NYSE:PHM), cruise line operator Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL), car auction company Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT), and alcoholic beverage maker Molson Coors Brewing (NYSE:TAP) round out the rest of the top five. In part, because it is equal-weighted, one interesting thing about MAGA is that it has a low weighting towards technology stocks compared to the S&P 500 and many broad-market ETFs.
Meanwhile, DEMZ, which is an ETF from Reflection Asset Management, invests in S&P 500 companies that have made 75% of their contributions to Democratic causes and candidates. This results in an ETF with 47 holdings, where the top 10 holdings make up 42.2% of the fund. As you can see from the overview below, DEMZ skews more towards the tech sector than MAGA does, with a relatively large 5.4% stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and top 10 positions in IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Also, those who have followed the ongoing battle between Florida’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis and Disney (NYSE:DIS) will probably not be surprised to find that Disney is one of the ETF’s top 10 holdings. Note that DEMZ is not an equal-weighted ETF like MAGA.
How Have These ETFs Performed?
Essentially, both ETFs use the same strategy to screen for companies that donate to political candidates or causes on opposite ends of the aisle. The process is similar, but the end result obviously ends with a different set of holdings. So, what type of results have these strategies provided for investors? 
As of the end of May, MAGA had a one-year total return of -8.9% (although, keep in mind that the S&P 500 was in a bear market last year, so this result isn’t as bad as it may sound. Zooming out to a three-year time frame, MAGA has produced solid 16.6% annualized total returns for its holders. However, over a five-year time horizon, these results drop down to a 7.5% annual return.
Meanwhile, DEMZ only launched in 2020, so it doesn’t have an extensive track record, but it had a 10.5% total annualized return since inception as of the end of the most recent quarter. 
Mind the Fees
These performances are solid enough (more on this later), but one thing that investors should be aware of is that both of these ETFs have fairly high expense ratios. DEMZ has a 0.45% expense ratio, while MAGA has an ever higher 0.72% expense ratio.
Closing Thoughts
These two ETFs are opposed in terms of their political ideologies, but they employ similar approaches toward stock selection.
Both have put up fair results over the last few years, but this brings up a bigger point. While the ETFs take fairly complex, novel approaches, investors may be better off just investing in a broad-market S&P 500 or Nasdaq (NDX) ETF with lower fees. Remember that both of these ETFs are screening for S&P 500 stocks as a starting point, and MAGA contains nearly one-third of the S&P 500 in its portfolio. 
Let’s say that you ignored the political noise and simply invested in the largest S&P 500 ETF, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO), or the largest Nasdaq ETF, the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) instead of MAGA or DEMZ. These ETFs have much lower expense ratios of 0.03% and 0.2%, respectively.
VOO’s expense ratio is orders of magnitude cheaper than that of MAGA or DEMZ, while QQQ’s isn’t as low but is still considerably cheaper. In year one, an investor putting $10,000 into one of these ETFs would pay just $3 in fees with VOO or $20 in QQQ versus $45 with DEMZ or $72 with MAGA. Over time, these fees can compound and make a real difference to your overall portfolio as an investor.
Beyond the fees, VOO has a solid performance track record. While it has lagged MAGA on a three-year basis with a 12.8% annualized return, it has outperformed it over a five-year timeframe with an 11% annualized return. Meanwhile, as of the end of the most recent quarter, QQQ had a three-year return of 19.8% and a five-year total annualized return of 15.7%, easily beating the competition.
Note that DEMZ has not been around for long enough to compile a three-year or five-year track record. It's also important to note that both of these ETFs are minnows in the bigger investing picture -- MAGA has $18.7 million in assets under management, while DEMZ has $23.5 million.
If, as an investor, it is truly important to you to invest in companies that donate to candidates from your side of the aisle, then these ETFs could theoretically warrant a place in your portfolio. They could also potentially be interesting as a vehicle for traders who want to use them as a way to bet on the outcomes of elections or certain legislation passing.
But beyond that, it seems like most investors would likely be better off keeping it simple via a broad-market fund like QQQ or VOO instead of making their financial futures political.

""It's maybe the most hated bull market in the history of bull markets,"" said Tim Holland, chief investment officer of investment platform Orion OCIO.
""Sentiment was terribly depressed going into year-end and still remains on the bearish side.""
The S&P 500 .SPX gained 4.93 points, or 0.11%, at 4,298.86, taking this week's advance to 0.38% and extending its winning streak to four weeks, the longest since the July-August 2022 period.

But it’s not a hot new AI fund or an ETF capitalizing on other en-vogue tech trends, although it will give you some exposure to them. Instead, it’s arguably one of the most boring, vanilla ETFs out there, but this doesn’t mean it can’t help you to grow your portfolio. It’s the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO). In fact, whether you are just beginning your investing journey or if you are already a veteran trader who has spent years in the investing game, this unassuming but massive ETF can serve as a sound building block for your portfolio. Here’s why. 
Harness the Power of the Entire S&P 500 in Your Portfolio 
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF boasts over $300 billion in assets under management (AUM), making it the third-largest ETF in the market today. While there are many complex investing strategies and products out there that claim to offer investors a leg up on the market, VOO keeps it simple. It invests in the S&P 500 (SPX), the index that consists of about 500 of the largest 500 U.S. stocks and arguably the most important and influential index in the investing world.
The S&P 500 covers all sectors of the U.S. economy, so rather than having to bet on individual sectors, an ETF like VOO gives you exposure to them all -- from tech leaders like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to old economy industrial giants like Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Deere (NYSE:DE) and everything in between.
The great thing about VOO is that it allows investors to harness the power and innovation of a large swath of the U.S. economy in one investment vehicle without having to pick favorite sectors or stocks. An investment in VOO is essentially a bet on around 500 of the top publicly-listed companies in the United States continuing to innovate and profit over time, which has historically been a winning proposition. 
Below, you’ll find an overview of VOO’s top 10 holdings, created using TipRanks' holdings tool.
Because it tracks the S&P 500 index itself, the fund is extraordinarily diversified, holding 504 stocks, and its top 10 positions make up just 27.8% of assets. As you can see, top holding Apple accounts for a 7.2% position in the fund, followed by Microsoft, which has a 6.6% weighting, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Alphabet (Class A) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rounding out the top five holdings. However, it’s not just tech stocks, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) and energy giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) follow closely behind. 
As you can see in the table, VOO's top holdings feature a pretty solid collection of Smart Scores. In fact, four of its top 10 holdings, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), feature 'Perfect 10' Smart Scores. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating, and VOO itself has a strong ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10.
Is VOO Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
So the quantitative factors rate VOO favorably, but what do Wall Street analysts think? VOO earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TipRanks based on analysts' ratings, and the average VOO stock price target of $445.50 implies upside potential of 11.9%. Of the 6,212 analyst ratings on the name, 59.13% are Buys, 35.33% are Holds, and just 5.54% are Sells.
Investor-Friendly Fees       
In addition to this ample diversification and broad exposure, another attractive feature of VOO is its low expense ratio. It’s hard to beat VOO’s minuscule expense ratio of just 0.03%. An investor putting $10,000 into VOO would pay just $3 in fees in year one. This type of investor-friendly expense structure helps investors defend the principal of their portfolios over time without coughing up too much in fees. For example, assuming this fee remains constant and that the fund returns 5% a year for the next 10 years, an investor will pay just $39 in fees over the course of the decade. Compare this to the multitude of ETFs on the market with expense ratios of 0.75%, where investors are paying $75 in fees on a $10,000 investment in just year one, and you really see the value proposition of an ETF like VOO.
Solid Long-Term Performance
With this diversification and investor-friendly expense ratio, it’s easy to see why this massive ETF is the most popular ETF in terms of inflows so far this year. Still, there’s also another factor leading to its popularity -- its long-term performance track record. VOO has consistently produced double-digit annualized total returns for its investors for a long time. No matter what time horizon you are looking over, VOO has delivered. As of the end of May, VOO had an annualized total return of 12.8% over a three-year time frame. Over a five-year time horizon, the massive ETF has delivered 11% total returns annually. Further, over the past 10 years, VOO returned 11.9% annually. VOO has been around since 2010, and since its inception that year, it has returned a stellar 13.3% on an annualized basis. 
Keeping Things Simple Can Pay Off
It doesn’t hurt to keep it simple. While there are plenty of exotic investment strategies out there, few beat an ETF like VOO over the long term. While this S&P 500 ETF isn't the type of investment that is going to give you a multi-bag return in a year, the reality is that few investments are. However, the good news is that investing in a broad-market ETF like this and allowing these gains to compound over the years is a time-tested way to build long-term wealth. Investors can dollar-cost average over time when they have a surplus of cash and/or when the S&P 500 falls while reinvesting dividends to amplify these results even more.
VOO’s strong performance track record, investor-friendly expense ratio, and portfolio of around 500 of the top U.S. stocks have made it a winner for a long time, and it's likely to remain a winner for the foreseeable future.

2023-06-14 00:00:00+00:00,Game-Changing News For AMD And Its Shareholders,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/game-changing-news-for-amd-and-its-shareholders,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) announced game-changing news when unveiled the MI300X super chip. The MI300X is the company’s latest development and a pure play on AI. The chip is intended to rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) chips, such as the H100, which run for around $30,000 each. That’s an important fact considering it takes multiple GPU Superchips to run most AI systems, and NVIDIA dominates 80% of the market.
In its efforts to make a big splash in AI, Advanced Micro Devices also offers an 8-chip AI cluster and software and architecture to support it all. If adopted by the industry, it could lead to a significant bump in revenue and earnings. The chips are slated to begin shipping later this year; NVIDIA recently issued guidance 50% above the consensus, which could easily happen for AMD. 
Will The Industry Turn To AMD For AI? 
The industry might begin to adopt the MI300X because it’s a better chip, at least regarding memory. The chips can store up to 192 GB of memory compared to the H100’s 120 GB, which is important for AI. AI models require large amounts of data, and the data sets are only getting bigger.
AMD CEO Lisa Su says the data center GPU market is worth about $30 billion and will grow at least 50% CAGR for the next 4 years. She expects total AI-driven data center demand to top $150 billion in 2027, a significant opportunity for the company. Five percent of that market is worth $7.5 billion or about 32% of AMD’s 2023 revenue outlook. 
Reuters, citing an AWS executive, says Amazon is already considering the chip a possibility. While no decision has been made, investors should expect AWS and others to try it. Dave Brown, VP of elastic compute cloud, says the company already discounted NVIDIA for its DGX Cloud offering and is working with AMD teams to see what the 2 can develop. AWS controls over 30% of the cloud market, which would be a significant revenue and earnings driver for AMD. 
The Analysts Applaud AMD’s News 
The analysts were bullish on AMD before the announcement, and Marketbeat has picked up no upgrades, but it is tracking 8 new price target increases, and more are sure to come. The new consensus is still below the price action but up 20% in the last 30 days, with most new targets in the $140 to $170 range. The single outlier is Deutsch Bank which has the stock pegged at a below-consensus $110. The takeaway is that consensus is trending sharply and leading the market higher. 
Institutions also support AMD. The institutions own 67% of the stock and have been buying on balance for over a year. The important detail is that activity has ramped over the last 3 quarters and is helping to drive the market higher. Assuming this continues, Advanced Micro Devices stock could easily trend higher. Buying and ownership are broad, another plus for the market. 
The Technical Outlook: Advanced Micro Devices Is In An Uptrend 
Advanced Micro Devices is in an uptrend and can move higher. After the announcement, the market experienced some volatility but is consolidating within a strong uptrend. The sideward movement may continue in the near term, but upward movement is expected in the short to mid-term. The stock is $13 below the low end of the new price target range, with a high likelihood that the range will move higher by the end of the year. The next quarter’s earnings report could be a blowout, assuming the AI market thinks this chip is worth a try.

June 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street was on track to open lower on Thursday as the Federal Reserve signaled that borrowing costs could increase further this year after it skipped raising them in its latest meeting.
The Fed left rates unchanged at the 5%-5.25% range on Wednesday, but indicated they could rise by at least half a percentage point this year as inflation remains stubbornly persistent and the U.S. economy stays resilient.
Traders see a 69% chance of a 25-basis-point rate hike in July, up from around 60% a day earlier, according to the CME Fedwatch tool.
""What has been encouraging is that the rate market has significantly reassessed the trajectory of expected interest rates but the equity market has largely ignored that and, if anything, continued to rise on the belief that the Fed is at or near the end of the rate hike cycle,"" said Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard.
""I do think yesterday's message was a bit of a splash of cold water on equity markets.""
Meanwhile, data showed U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose in May as consumers spent on a range of goods including vehicles, which could help support the economy this quarter.
Another set of numbers showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits were steady at a seasonally adjusted 262,0000 for the week ended June 10. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 249,000 claims for the latest week.
The S&P 500 .SPX and Nasdaq .IXIC rose for a fifth consecutive session on Wednesday, while the Dow .DJI ended down following the Fed decision.
Market heavyweights Apple AAPL.O, Nvidia NVDA.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O fell between 0.2% and 1.2% in premarket trading.
Shares of Tesla TSLA.O dipped 3.0%. The stock snapped a record 13-day streak of gains in the previous session.
At 8:58 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were down 40 points, or 0.12%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 13.75 points, or 0.31%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 77.25 points, or 0.51%.
Kohls Corp KSS.N added 3.1% after TD Cowen upgraded the department store operator to ""outperform"" from ""market perform"".
U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies such as Alibaba Group BABA.N and JD.com JD.O rose almost 2% after the People's Bank of China cut the borrowing cost for its medium-term policy loans for the first time in 10 months.

2023-06-16 00:00:00+00:00,2 Under-the-Radar AI ETFs to Watch,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-under-the-radar-ai-etfs-to-watch,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is generating a lot of hype, but early signs are beginning to emerge that this is no mere stock market bubble but a sea change that will produce tangible economic results. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) believes that AI could increase productivity by 1.5% per year for the next decade and boost the S&P 500’s (SPX) profits by 30% over the same time frame.
Earlier, the renowned investment bank predicted that generative AI (more on this shortly) could help to lift global GDP by 7%, or $7 trillion, over the next decade. A great way to invest in this emerging megatrend is through ETFs. Here are two under-the-radar AI ETFs that take interesting approaches to the space. Both are fairly new and are relatively small in terms of assets under management, and both could be hidden gems for investor portfolios. 
1. Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:CHAT)
CHAT is the world’s-first ETF focused specifically on generative AI, the technology that Goldman Sachs hailed as having the capability to increase GDP. Roundhill explains that generative AI is AI that can create new and unique content, such as images or text, by “learning patterns and structures from existing data.”
Generative AI differs from generalized, traditional AI “in its ability to create new, unique content, rather than just analyzing or processing existing information.” Examples of generative AI you may have seen or experienced would be asking ChatGPT to write a poem or story for you or creating an image seemingly out of thin air with Dall-E. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is now incorporating AI into its core Photoshop and Illustrator products with Firefly, its creative generative AI engine that allows users to describe the images they want to generate using text.  
As such, it’s no surprise that Adobe makes up a 5.2% weighting in the CHAT ETF. Overall, CHAT has 35 holdings, and its top 10 positions account for 56.1% of the fund. Below, you can take a look at CHAT’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ Holdings Tool.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is CHAT’s top holding, which makes sense as Nvidia’s semiconductors are powering today’s generative AI applications. Beyond these names and other mega-cap tech names like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), CHAT casts a wide net in looking for generative AI names.
It owns quite a few Chinese companies that are making advances in AI, from stocks that are well-known to Western investors like Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Tencent (OTC:TCEHY), to more under-the-radar names like iFlytek Co. and SenseTime Group. These types of stocks are stocks can be difficult for retail investors to access, so it’s nice to have the option to be able to gain exposure to them through CHAT. 
We first covered CHAT last month when it launched and had under $2 million in assets under management (AUM). Now, just a few weeks later, CHAT has grown to over $66 million in AUM. While this is still relatively small in the world of ETFs, it shows that CHAT is garnering momentum. The only downsides to point out about CHAT is that it is a new, small ETF without a proven track record, and it has a relatively high expense ratio of 0.75%.  
Nonetheless, CHAT looks like an interesting option for investors thanks to its unique, undiluted focus on generative AI and its portfolio that goes off the beaten path to find these generative AI companies.
Also, it has an ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10. The Smart Score is TipRanks’ proprietary quantitative stock scoring system. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. The score is data-driven and does not involve any human intervention.
Is CHAT Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Analysts view CHAT as a Moderate Buy. Over 75% of the ratings on CHAT are Buys, 21.8% are Holds, and just 2.8% are Sells. It should be noted that the average CHAT stock price target of $31.55 represents only 4.9% upside potential, reflecting the fact that the price of CHAT has run up over 15% since its launch just a month ago.
2. WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence & Innovation Fund (BATS:WTAI)
Like CHAT, the WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence & Innovation Fund is a relative newcomer to the world of ETFs, launching in December 2021. It's larger than CHAT, with nearly $100 million in AUM, and it has a comparatively lower expense ratio of 0.45%.  
While WTAI isn’t exclusively focused on generative AI like CHAT, it takes a comprehensive approach toward investing across the space as a whole, including AI software, semiconductors, hardware (which includes things like drones, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation), and innovation, which WisdomTree describes as any application of AI technology disrupting existing industries. 
WTAI is more diversified than CHAT, with 79 holdings, and its top 10 holdings make up just 20.9% of the fund. Below, you can get an overview of WTAI’s top 10 holdings.
Like CHAT, WTAI’s top position is Nvidia, although with a smaller 2.55% weighting. Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is the fund’s second-largest holding, and the semiconductor space is well-represented throughout the top 10 with these names plus Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) and Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS). 
Like CHAT, WTAI isn’t afraid to go off the beaten path and go international in its search for AI leaders, with top 10 positions in Taiwan’s Alchip Technologies and Switzerland’s STMicroelectronics NV (NYSE:STM). WTAI also has positions in the mega-cap tech names that are pushing advances in AI, like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).
WTAI has a Neutral ETF Smart Score of 7, one point lower than CHAT.
Is WTAI Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
WTAI is viewed as a Moderate Buy by analysts, and nearly 70% of analyst ratings on the ETF are Buys. The average WTAI stock price target of $21.09 is just 7.7% above the ETF’s current price, reflecting the fact that the ETF has gained nearly 40% year-to-date.
Investor Takeaway 
AI and generative AI will have a long-term impact for years to come, and this is the type of secular trend that I personally want to invest in. I like CHAT because of its unique, laser-like focus on generative AI, as well as the fact that it leaves no stone unturned in its hunt for AI stocks. I like WTAI for its comprehensive, all-encompassing approach to AI innovation. Therefore, both ETFs look like intriguing options for investors who want to add exposure to their portfolios.

Chicago, IL – June 20, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares NVIDIA NVDA as the Bull of the Day and Tyson Foods TSN as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Meta META.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.
Bull of the Day:
As NVIDIA cruised into the stratosphere of $1 trillion valuations, one of the most common remarks heard across business and social media was “Oh my, look at that sky-high valuation!”
There was first talk of NVDA trading at 100 times on a price to earnings (PE) basis.
Then I saw posts about a 200X PE.
Where were investors and journalists -- and armchair analyst-traders -- getting these ridiculous numbers?
The Rearview Mirror
Mostly from looking backwards. Because when NVIDIA reported quarterly earnings on May 24, those looking in the rearview mirror ran off the road in bewilderment.
Maybe they got scared by the “smart trucks” (large quantitative investors) accelerating behind them.
But if they had only listened to me in my umpteenth explanation of why you buy NVDA at all valuations between 10 and 20 times sales, they would have been looking forward.
For years I have said two things over and over again…
1. Advances in Gaming GPU R&D were teaching NVIDIA engineers what they needed to know to build the foundations of AI.
2. Datacenter demands for AI “massively parallel architectures” would overtake Gaming revenues in the early 2020s.
On March 20, I published a special edition of Zacks Confidential (ZC) where I outlined why NVIDIA was still the reigning “King of AI” and how the acceleration of, and access to, tools from ChatGPT had just put the stock back on the launch pad -- even though we already had 100%+ gains from buying the October lows.
Here are some excerpts from that report titled ChatGPT: Time to Become an AI Conversationalist…
I've pounded the table about the King of AI since 2016 for several reasons that all preceded the current gee-whiz fascination with ChatGPT -- including the emerging ability for software to write itself.
What I did NOT predict is that ChatGPT would catch on like wildfire this year and be the instrument that directly and rapidly teaches everyone the power of AI.
Now, we're all talking about the ""super bot"" in awed, hushed tones, and wondering what jobs it can replace.
In this report, we'll examine the capabilities, and the fears, of the chatterbox that ate the internet.
What Was So Super About NVIDIA AI Before ChatGPT?
First, we recap a basic 3-prong thesis for being awed by the power of AI, especially in the hands of NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and his teams of engineering wizards...
1) NVIDIA does deep research in nearly all applications of HPC (high-performance computing) and hyper-scale data mining and modeling that create the foundations for autonomous driving, protein and molecule discovery, factory design and automation, and the future of scientific discoveries in cancer, energy, agriculture, longevity, and climate.
And they are able to do this because they don't just build the hardware GPU (graphics processing unit) semiconductors that make hyper-scale possible. They also build the software engines that integrate with them in a full stack of developer tools called CUDA, for Compute Unified Device Architecture. Along with work at Alphabet and Microsoft, these are the most powerful platforms in the world that can use neural networks to create machine learning (ML) reinforcement and deep learning (DL) inference.
For these reasons, I continuously encourage investors -- whether they own NVDA shares or not -- to frequent the company's newsroom page to see the constant stream of innovations, discoveries, and partnerships that make the industry of AI as powerful as any for business, science, and society.
2) Jensen Huang and his superior leadership strategy is not only focused on hiring the best engineering talent, but they also collaborate with major scientific institutions and technology companies to put the best tools in the smartest, most(ly) ethical hands. They build the most powerful supercomputers in the world for these organizations by stacking and connecting hundreds of their GPU-based DGX machines, as one example, to create ""massively parallel architectures"" vs. the slower serial-processing of CPUs from Intel.
Plus, they know how to evangelize the platform technologies of AI by supporting developer communities where new ideas and solutions will be created at ground level that we haven't even imagined.
3) The day that software can meaningfully write itself is nearly upon us. I've written often about Ray Kurzweil's ""singularity"" prediction -- when AGI (artificial general intelligence) becomes equivalent (or superior) to human intelligence -- and he may be getting ready to pull that forecast forward again, from his original target for the year 2045.
(end of excerpt from my March 20th Zacks Confidential)
In that report, I said that investors still needed to buy the stock at $250 then, looking for at least $300 this year -- despite semiconductor analyst Joe Moore at Morgan Stanley reluctantly raising his price target to $300.
Little did he or I know that Jensen & Co. would blow the roof off with a big raise in sales guidance on May 24. But I want to share what he said because, at the time, he was very prescient about the NVDA + GPT growth potential -- even though he was a reluctant diner and I was devouring the feast of possibilities with years of high double-digit compound growth ahead as AI surpasses the mobile industry revolution with a potential TAM (total addressable market) of $15 trillion…
Network Effects and Exponential Compounding
Last Friday (3/17/23), a Morgan Stanley analyst threw in the towel on his Neutral rating for NVDA and wrote ""The stock will continue to be hard to ignore in an otherwise challenging semiconductor environment.""
Analyst Joseph Moore raised his rating on NVDA shares to Overweight from Equal-Weight and bumped his price target from $255 to $304 as he conceded that he underestimated the growth resilience of the innovator's products and admitted that the ""megatrend"" of generative AI will overshadow all doubts.
""The high capital intensity of these workloads, particularly on the training side, is now a major part of the calculus for the largest companies in technology, with NVIDIA having dominance in the training market that is likely to persist for several years even with a relatively fixed number of model developers, model complexity plus multiple languages should still drive 3-5x growth in training over 5 years.""
Moore also observed that the enthusiasm the firm is seeing for Large Language Models is boosting spending both in the near and long-term. In fact, NVDA just filed a securities shelf offering for $10 billion two weeks ago and, since the stock barely flinched, maybe that's what moved the analyst to admit how dominant their position will remain with new investment. Large enterprise customers who depend on data ""mining and modeling"" will want what Jensen is building for many years to come.
As his final mea culpa, Moore noted that ""the power of transformers has become clear as products such as ChatGPT and other AI workloads have moved up priority lists and are now seen as one of the most significant developments in technology since the development of mobile internet.""
How Forward Estimate Revisions Leave Behind the Backward Bears
In my full ZC on ChatGPT, which you can get a copy of by emailing Ultimate@Zacks.com -- and tell ‘em Cooker sent you -- I explain the dynamics of “GPT” (Generative Pre-Training Transformers) and I give you 4 other stock picks to capitalize on the revolution that is being televised in real-time.
But now let’s get to the goodness of what analysts have done with sales and earnings estimates since Jensen & Co. dropped their “demand-driven” bomb.
Here’s how I described the situation in TAZR Trader on May 24…
NVIDIA: It's the TAM, Stupid!
Posted on 5/24/23

""How extremely stupid not to have thought of that.""
Thomas Henry Huxley, upon hearing of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection
NVIDIA blew some doors off tonight -- and not just for the bears.
Yes, they raised guidance significantly. But so many investors and amateur analysts are still grappling to understand the significance of this juggernaut that I have called the King of AI for 6 years...

And there are still so many amateurs who never understood those drivers then (or even yesterday) and still try to sound like experts now -- heck, they didn't even know what ""CUDA"" stood for last year!
ChatGPT and NVDA shares' meteoric rise have made them all very interested ""experts"" now.
And I bet they still didn't know tonight what Ampere, or Hopper, or Lovelace are. We know because we talk about them and I'm writing a book about ""13 Great Women of Science"" which includes Madames Hopper and Lovelace!
Nor do they understand a DGX, or a ""petaflop,"" much less a ""massively parallel architecture"" used for deep learning training and inference.
It's almost comical, if it weren't so sad. Next, when CRISPR stocks go meteor, they'll be all about them too.
Anyway, my point is to be careful about the analysis you hear over the next few days and weeks as the arm-chair AI experts tell you why or why not NVDA shares should trade at any given valuation of 100X or 200X EPS.
As you know, I've traded NVDA from extreme valuations of 5X sales (realllly cheap) up to 30X sales (pretttty expensive).
And as I told our internal strategy group tonight in a chat...
""P/E for NVDA doesn't matter as they dominate a TAM (total addressable market) that is hard to calculate right now. Is it $300 billion? $500B? (Some projections are for $2 trillion by 2030 and I think that is conservative.) So it can grow into a 20X sales valuation for a while. Imagine the transition from datacenters that were CPU-centric (serial processing) and devoid of software for training & inference. GPU A100 and H100 cards set the standard now as massively parallel architectures in DGX machines (8 cards with 50+ billion transistors). The one they built for Tesla that does 1.8 exaflops stacks hundreds of DGX boxes (basically a 2-foot cube). Every corp will want one now. That's tens of thousands of $68,000 machines. CUDA has been the development platform they didn't know they needed for design, engineering, data crunching and simulation.""
What do we mean when we talk about doing a billion or a trillion calculations per second?
Just like a million million equals a trillion, so too a billion billion equals a quintillion.
Coming to terms: FLOP stands for ""floating point operations per second."" An exaflop is a measure of performance for a supercomputer that can calculate at least 10 to the 18th power, or one quintillion, FLOPS.
In mid 2022, CEO Jensen Huang guesstimated a TAM for NVIDIA of $300 billion in hardware and $300 billion in software. This is the defining projection for the CUDA hard+soft stack I've been preaching about for 6 years.
I think Jensen has been so conservative because it would blow the minds of even professional analysts to think about what is possible.
Imagine NVDA growing to just 3X a $600 billion TAM where it would still be the dominant player...
That would be a $1.5 trillion valuation minimum. See you soon above $1T.
(end of May 24 TAZR commentary excerpt)
Architect of the AI Supercomputer
I used to talk 5 years ago about how much NVIDIA’s revenue could grow as they sold DGX boxes for $68,000. That’s the “mini” supercomputer in a 2-cubic foot space with 400 to 500 billion transistors for machine learning (ML)  applications -- depending on what generation of GPU card is used, from Volta to Ampere to Hopper. The A100 system-on-a-chip GPU costs $10,000 each.
A single DGX box is capable of massive computing power of between 1 to 5 petaFLOPS. A petaFLOP is a billion million floating point operations per second, so you can imagine how many you need to build a supercomputer like the one at Tesla.
Here’s a good description from software consulting firm Run:ai of what a user gets for their investment in a single DGX box…
“Beyond the powerful hardware they provide, DGX systems come out of the box with an optimized operating system and a complete pre-integrated environment for running deep learning projects. They provide a containerized software architecture that lets data scientists easily deploy the deep learning frameworks and management tools they need with minimal setup or configuration.”
To build a corporate, university, or scientific R&D lab supercomputer, you need between 100 and 1,000 of these dynamic cubes, “stacked” together to form “massively parallel architectures.”
Now a DGX box costs anywhere from $100,000 to $150,000. Not to mention the value-enriching capabilities of the full CUDA hardware+software stack.
And every major enterprise wants 100 to 1,000 of them now that ChatGPT took center stage. They either need to capitalize on the “chatterbox that ate the internet,” or exceed it.
THIS is the math you need to understand to grasp how and why Wall Street analysts underestimated NVIDIA sales potential, even after ChatGPT.
And they are just catching up with these potential topline moves…
Fiscal year 2024 (ends January ‘24): $42.64 billion = 58% growth
Fiscal year 2025 (ends January ‘25): $54.70 billion = 28% growth
These are dramatic turnarounds from where revenue projections were only a few months ago when I wrote my ChatGPT report.
Back in mid-March, FY24 sales were cast at around $30 billion and FY25 was around $37 billion. But you were already starting to see the optimism being expressed in those 12-24 months forward estimates as ChatGPT caught like wildfire and NVIDIA was inking deals left and right with partners like Microsoft.
In fact, the day I published that ChatGPT report on March 20 was the start of the greatest computing event of the year, the NVIDIA GPU Tech Conference, or GTC. Jensen & Co. are always full of surprises that wow the tech crowd and this was no disappointment.
NVIDIA launched DGX Cloud, where users can rent access for $37,000 per month. And they unveiled DGX GH200, a large-memory AI supercomputer that uses NVIDIA NVLink to combine up to 256 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips into a single data-center sized GPU. Google Cloud, Meta and Microsoft are already the first customers.
This was one of the primary drivers in the dramatic leap in sales estimates for this year and next.
What Price-to-Sales Valuation Do We Have Now?
On current-year estimates we have $1 trillion/$42 billion = 23.8 times.
On next year estimates of $55 billion, we have 18X.
To me, that’s a BUY based on everything I’ve presented.
Regarding misplaced P/E ratios, when NVDA EPS FY25 estimates were at only $6 a month ago (before their quarterly report), the stock was trading at 50X EPS.
Then when shares launched above $400 after earnings on May 24, allMay the valuation hand-wringers started screaming about 100X and even 200X earnings. But, again, they were looking backwards at trailing EPS. In the worst possible view of earnings, some are looking at fully-diluted TTM (trailing 12 months) EPS of $2.19. In the best possible TTM view, they are using around $3.35 non-GAAP.
Right now, the FY24 EPS consensus is for $7.64 and FY25 is over $10, putting the forward PE somewhere around 50 times.
For a conservative view of these numbers, let’s hear from analysts at Stifel Nicolaus where they have a $370 price target and Hold rating on shares…
“We continue to view NVDA as amongst the best-positioned companies to benefit from accelerated AI-focused spending. With shares trading well above the company's 5-year average multiple on a forward earnings basis at 54.2x our F2024 EPS estimate and 50.4x our F2025 estimate, versus average multiples of 42x and 35x, respectively, we believe strong near-term momentum is well understood.”
I’m not saying NVDA is cheap. But the world has finally woken up to its AI potential and you may never get the chance to buy it at 10X sales again. Maybe 15X sales during a correction, or after an earnings miss. So don't blink if you see a $750
billion market cap. Just buy.
Bear of the Day:
In early April, the Zacks Rank pegged Tyson Foods as a candidate for lower share prices as earnings estimates fell ahead of their quarterly report on May 8.
My colleague Andrew Rocco wrote about TSN slipping into the cellar of the Zacks Rank on April 10 when shares were trading above $60 and he identified several fundamental trends that led analysts to lower their estimates for the chicken products giant.
One area of weaker growth surprised me: beef. I didn't know that this segment was bigger for Tyson than its chicken sales. Here's how Andrew summed it up in April...
""Meanwhile, last quarter, earnings growth was an abysmal -70% year-over-year. The company's lagging beef segment is one factor dragging down Tyson’s growth. In Q1, Tyson’s beef segment declined from $5,002 million to $4,723 million. The slowdown is not isolated to Tyson – the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) projects fiscal 2023 domestic production to fall roughly 5% in the segment.""
Earnings Confirm the Slowdown
On May 8 Tyson Foods came out with a quarterly loss of $0.04 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.81. This compares to earnings of $2.29 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -104.94%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this meat producer would post earnings of $1.35 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.85, delivering a surprise of -37.04%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.
Tyson, which belongs to the Zacks Food - Meat Products industry, posted revenues of $13.13 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.45%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $13.12 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.
Zacks Rank Nails the Drop
When Andrew wrote his report in April, analysts had lowered consensus EPS from $4.18 to $2.21, and this dramatic drop in estimates put TSN into the Zacks #5 Rank cellar.
Since the May report (for Tyson's Q2 of fiscal year 2023, ending in September), the consensus has now fallen to $1.48 after that big earnings miss and lowered guidance. This keeps TSN shares at a #5 Rank Strong Sell.
The stock is also still over 20% lower from April levels. Another interesting dynamic is that the stock is well off of its early 2022 peak near $100 since the bear market began.
The reason I find this interesting is that while inflation drove food prices higher for consumers, the producers clearly were hit with higher costs that they couldn't pass along to distributors.
This was something that Andrew also identified in his discussion of declining profit margins for Tyson.
Quarter Breakdown
Tyson management also lowered its revenue guidance for fiscal 2023. This can be accountable to consumers opting for alternatives amid the inflationary landscape, per media sources.
Despite a tough protein market, Tyson Foods has been optimistic about its long-term prospects due to its growth strategies and focus on enhancing margins.
Total Q2 sales were $13,133 million, nearly flat with the year-ago quarter figure. The top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,602 million. Average price changes had a 3.2% adverse impact on the top line, while total volumes rose 3.3%.
The gross profit in the quarter came in at $527 million, down from the $1,735 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The gross profit, as a percentage of sales, came in at roughly 4%, down from the 13.2% reported in the year-ago quarter.
Tyson Foods’ adjusted operating income plunged 94% to $65 million. The adjusted operating margin contracted to 0.5% from the 8.9% reported in the year-ago quarter.
Segmental Details
Beef: Sales in the segment declined to $4,617 million from the $5,034 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Volumes dropped 2.9% and the average price fell 5.4% in the segment.
Pork: Sales in the segment declined to $1,421 million from the $1,565 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Volumes climbed 1.1%, while the average price tumbled 10.3%.
Chicken: Sales in the segment increased to $4,430 million from the $4,086 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Sales volumes rose 6.4% and the average price increased 2%.
Prepared Foods: Sales in the segment rose to $2,422 million from the $2,393 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Prepared Foods’ sales volumes dipped 0.4% and the average price increased 1.6%.
International/Other: Sales in the segment were $634 million, up from the $565 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Volumes moved up 8% and the average sales price jumped 4.2%.
Bottom line on Tyson: While US chicken consumption is expected to rise to over 100 lbs per capita in this decade, producers face headwinds from rising costs, meat alternatives, and other healthy and/or sustainable choices. This story may not turn around for several quarters. The Zacks Rank will let you know.

2023-06-21 00:00:00+00:00,Turnkey Tech Investing: May 2023 Market Brief,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/turnkey-tech-investing%3A-may-2023-market-brief,"For some time, markets have been grappling with a handful of counteracting dynamics, including the clash between the bulls and the bears, the interplay between stimulus and inflation, and the delicate balance between growth and rate hikes. Adding to the mix in May was the US debt-ceiling conundrum and, of course, the ‘emergence’ of AI.
Despite occasional glimpses of one side pulling harder in each tug of war, it is striking just how polarized these debates remain—including the differing views on the growth outlook for robotics and AI. In my opinion, the naysayers have already lost the battle on this count. The massive growth of robots and AI is not a question but a sheer inevitability. I may sound like a broken record, but this is the message I’ve been broadcasting for the past 8 years.
Of course, the bullish narrative extends far beyond the trajectory of AI, bolstered heavily by US soft landing expectations that are underpinned by a strong labor market, improved earnings trends, and the easing regional banking stress. Still, sticky global inflation, tightening lending standards, narrow US market leadership, and an underwhelming China recovery continue to add some bearish angst to the mix. Even with the resolution of the debt-ceiling issue, it remains to be seen where equities will run—at least in the near term.
For the month of May, with artificial intelligence now on the center stage of most investors’ minds, The ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF (THNQ) advanced +11.84%, while the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO) gained +2.10%, and the ROBO Global Healthcare Technology and Innovation ETF (HTEC) declined -4.47%.1
It’s remarkable that just 6 stocks—Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (META)—have accounted for nearly all of the S&P 500 (SPX) YTD return. But with a closer look, that news should come as no surprise. Nvidia guiding 50% above consensus was nothing short of historic as the chipmaker is on the cusp of the trillion-dollar club, while the others, all strong tech companies with relatively long histories of success, continue to rise with the tide. While the AI boom has clearly become a secular growth tailwind, it is worth noting that there are still areas of weakness even within tech.
Over the past few years, we’ve discussed the impact of all forms of AI in areas such as autonomous vehicles, computer vision, and collaborative robots. Today, the market is more narrowly focused on generative AI, of which ChatGPT is arguably the most well-known example. Generative AI is capable of creating, classifying and condensing content including text, image and audio. It is also used to generate ‘synthetic data’—new artificial data based on key facets within a smaller sample of real data, that is typically used to accelerate the training of other AI programs and avoid potential issues around privacy that arise when using primary data. The capabilities of generative AI are advancing at a remarkable pace. The costs of developing and training models today typically run to many millions of dollars, but open-source models are gaining ground and are expected to drive rapid adoption of this key technology. Concurrently, synthetic data could empower start-ups to challenge incumbents whose historical data repositories are perhaps less of a moat now than once seemed the case. This may mean some of the anticipated cost savings made above need to be re-invested.
Given the growing importance of AI, the call for investors to take advantage of this megatrend is becoming especially urgent. Generative AI’s ability to augment core processes within AI models will have a direct impact on the pharmaceutical, manufacturing, media, architecture, interior design, engineering, automotive, aerospace, defense, medical, electronics, and energy industries. And its ability to improve business processes across organizations will impact marketing, design, corporate communications, training, and software engineering. Gartner Research (among many others) clearly sees the writing on the wall. Its near-term predictions2 paint a clear picture of the massive impact that lies just ahead:
By 2025, more than 30% of new drugs and materials will be systematically discovered using generative AI techniques, the use of synthetic data will reduce the volume of real data needed for machine learning by 70%, and 30% of outbound marketing messages from large organizations will be synthetically generated, up from less than 2% in 2022. We note that Salesforce recently announced the release of its Einstein GPT to generate personalized emails to customers on behalf of salespeople, specific query responses on behalf of customer service professionals, and targeted content for marketers.
By 2026, over 100 million humans will engage robo-colleagues (synthetic virtual co-workers) to contribute to enterprise work.
By 2027, nearly 15% of new applications will be automatically generated by AI without a human in the loop, up from 0% today.
  In our view, the breadth of Gartner’s predictions places general purpose technology (GPT) status on generative AI on par with the impact of the printing press, electricity, railroads, and even the internet. As with these earlier innovations, generative AI is likely to have a significant effect on the labor market. For investors ready to make the most of this incredible shift, our THNQ ETF offers diversified access across the value chain of artificial intelligence.
Eight years ago, ROBO Global was an outlier. We, too, saw the writing on the wall—though earlier than many who lacked the deep knowledge and insights into the world of automation, robotics, and AI. Today, even in the thick of a turbulent economic and market environment, our strategies are poised to help investors take advantage of what has ‘suddenly’ become an undeniable and momentous paradigm shift driven by these vital technologies.

2023-06-23 00:00:00+00:00,Do AI Chip Stocks Have More Room to Grow? Nvidia and AMD in Focus,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/do-ai-chip-stocks-have-more-room-to-grow-nvidia-and-amd-in-focus,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductor chips have been capturing investors’ collective imagination – and for good reason. Together, they’re driving the technology of the future. Semiconductor chips are ubiquitous in our digital age, and AI has in recent months begun transforming the way we communicate with our machines. The convergence of these two fields implies limitless possibilities.
For investors, this is particularly exciting. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, the PHLX, which tracks the chip sector through the performance of the 30 largest semiconductor makers, has gained approximately 39% so far this year.""
The PHLX is up for good reason. Semiconductors have been here for decades, and are found in pretty much everything in today’s digital world, but combined with AI, they’ll be driving tomorrow’s technology. Investors have picked up on this, and have made chip makers the go-to for AI stocks.
The question now is, how much more room do the AI chip stocks have to grow? We can consult the Street’s analysts – several top stock pros have been weighing in on AI and semiconductors, and their comments can shed more light on the sector. Let’s take a look at what they have to say, and which AI-related chip giants they’re recommending.
Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)
First up is Nvidia, a major name in the semiconductor industry, the eighth largest chip maker by revenue. Nvidia is a leader in the production of graphics processing units (GPUs), and has built its reputation on these high-end chips. The chips are capable of handling the computing power needs of several high-end, processing-intensive applications, including professional graphic design, high-end gaming -- and AI. Demand for Nvidia’s GPUs, especially in the latter application, has powered the stock’s strong gains this year; for the year-to-date, NVDA shares are up approximately 190%.
Recent data show that Nvidia’s performance is standing on its AI products. OpenAI, the company that launched ChatGPT, has been using Nvidia’s GPUs since 2020 in training its AI units – to the tune of 20,000 chips. Looking ahead, OpenAI has indicated that it may need another 10,000 chips to maintain ChatGPT efficiency.
This is a firm foundation for Nvidia’s success, and the company’s strong position can be inferred from the solid beat it recorded in its recent Q1 financial results. This report showed a total top line revenue of $7.19 billion. While this was down 13% from the prior year, it beat the forecast by an impressive $670 million. The bottom line figure, a non-GAAP EPS of $1.09, was 17 cents per share better than had been anticipated.
Better yet, from an investor’s perspective, was Nvidia’s guidance. The company is predicting $11 billion in sales for its fiscal Q2, a massive increase from its previous guidance of $7.2 billion. Achieving this will translate to a 41% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenues.
This company’s strength in AI forms the basis for the upbeat comments by Morgan Stanley’s 5-star analyst Joseph Moore, who writes: “NVDA should trade at a premium to peers given the higher probability of upward revisions near term, but the multiple premium vs. those peers has actually narrowed meaningfully... Nonetheless, we do see continued growth in the NVDA data center business, in a multi-year trajectory that should be clearly above all other compute players on a composite basis, given there is no offsetting or cannibalized compute business outside of the AI business. 
“As a result,"" the analyst added, ""we see NVDA as the cleanest story in AI hardware, and believe it continues to deserve more consideration from investors looking for AI exposure, even if the current valuation construct and YTD stock return already reflects expectations that are higher than secondary or tertiary players.”
To this end, Moore puts an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on NVDA, which he has promoted to be his Top Pick. In Moore’s view, NVDA will hit $500 by this time next year, implying a gain of 18.5% from current levels. (To watch Moore’s track record, click here)
Overall, Nvidia gets a Strong Buy rating form the Wall Street analysts’ consensus, based on 33 recent reviews that break down to 30 Buys against just 3 Holds. The shares are trading for $422.09 and the $464.85 average price target suggest a modest 10% upside in the next 12 months. (See NVDA stock forecast)
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
AMD, by sales, is perennially one of the top ten largest chip making firms, and saw total revenues of $23.06 billion in the last four quarters (2Q22 through 1Q23). The company boasts a $188 billion market cap, and has a wide portfolio in the AI ecosystem, including high-performance chips and architecture.
AMD’s AI exposure incudes its Instinct GPU accelerators, the Alveo Adaptive accelerators, and the EPYC server processors, as well as several lines of chips, including its Ryzen AI mobile processors, and the Versal AI core adaptive SoCs. AMD’s AI chips and accelerators are found in a wide range of applications, from gaming to data centers to supercomputers, and provide the processing speed and capacity needed for generative AI.
By the numbers, the company’s recent performance was better than been expected. In the first quarter of this year, AMD showed $5.35 billion in total revenues. While that was down about 9% year-over-year, it beat the forecasts by $40 million. The company’s non-GAAP EPS bottom line of 60 cents per share also beat the forecast, by 4 cents over the estimates. On the negative side, the company’s Q2 revenue guidance of $5.3 billion was considered weak, and was below the $5.52 billion expectations.
The company’s AI portfolio provides important support for the firm. AMD is shifting its strategic focus to the emerging AI market, and is investing heavily in both networking and data center AI operations. Getting to specifics, AMD’s new Ryzen 7000 series includes AI processing capabilities, and the MI300 chips are designed for both high-performance computing and AI applications. The latter track will find support from the rapidly growing generative AI field.
These are the key points behind Baird analyst Tristan Gerra’s comments on AMD. Gerra, who holds a 5-star rating from TipRanks, says of the company: “Mi300x claims best-in-class TCO performance for inference applications, and management reiterated its expectation for meaningful AI revenue starting in 4Q23 based on multiple hyperscaler engagements. AMD sees a >50% CAGR for data center AI acceleration by 2027, to a $150B+ TAM. While its ecosystem is not as mature as Nvidia, AMD is well positioned to be a key beneficiary of AI secular growth trends for the medium term, in our view.”
Based on the above, Gerra sets an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on AMD shares, and he gives the stock a price target of $170 to imply a 54.5% upside potential on the 12-month horizon. (To watch Gerra’s track record, click here)
Overall, the Street gives AMD a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 29 recent analyst reviews that include 21 Buys and 8 Holds. The stock’s current trading price is $110.01, and its $134.31 average price target suggests that it will appreciate by 22% in the year ahead. (See AMD stock forecast)

2023-06-26 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Fell Today,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-fell-today-0,"What happened
Shares of GPU leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) fell as much as 5% on Monday, before recovering to a 3.7% decline at the end of trading.
At first glance, there doesn't appear to be any particular news that would have driven Nvidia lower. The Nasdaq Composite is down today more than the broader market, and Nvidia is certainly a large component of that; however, Nvidia shares are down by much more than the index.
In the absence of news, the extended sell-off could be attributed to a prominent valuation professor publishing a long blog post last Friday, in which he concludes Nvidia is only worth about $240 per share, or about 60% of its current value.
Yet before investors panic, one should dig into the professor's rationale.
So what
NYU valuation professor Aswath Damodaran is a widely followed figure who writes detailed analysis of his stock picks and frequently appears in the financial media. Full disclosure: I actually am a former student of his, and still use the professor's valuation frameworks today when attempting to value a stock. For the most part, the professor leans on a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, in which a stock's value is worth the present value of all future cash flows, discounted back to the present.
The value one derives from a DCF analysis is based on several factors: growth, margins, capital investments needed to achieve that growth, the length of the high-growth period before ""maturity,"" and the discount rate one uses on future cash flows.
Without delving into every detail, the professor uses a 10-year model, in which Nvidia's revenues grow to $267 billion in 2033, about 10x the amount over the past 12 months. Damodaran also projects about 40% operating margins, which are much higher than today's but are actually not much higher than the recent cyclical peaks of 2018 and 2021.
The professor also forecasts a sales-to-capital ratio (with capitalized research and development costs) rising from $0.65 to $1.15 of sales for every dollar of capital spent over that time. And finally, Damodaran uses a high discount rate of 12.21% today, but gradually falling to 8.85% over 10 years as the inflationary environment abates and Nvidia matures to become less risky.
Now, while that valuation model spits out a $240-per-share value, it should also be noted that Professor Damodaran acknowledges a range of outputs depending on differences in those inputs and assumptions within a Monte Carlo analysis.
Within those simulations, there is a small chance that Nvidia's value actually exceeds the current $407-per-share valuation, although that is assigned a relatively low probability in the analysis.
Also less scary: At the conclusion of the blog post, Damodaran only decides to sell half of his Nvidia position, which he's held since 2018, while ""holding on to the other half, more for the optionality (that the company will find other new markets to enter in the next decade).""
Now what
It may seem curious that the professor is holding any shares, given that his base case is 40% lower than shares today. However, while Damodaran makes very precise calculations, he is the first to acknowledge the high uncertainty involved in valuing a growth stock.
Two main factors that could increase that value are severalfold. First, Damodaran is basing his revenue targets on his projections of the AI, gaming, and auto chip markets in 2033, as well as Nvidia's ultimate market share. Not only could those assumptions be wrong, but it's also possible Nvidia may find new markets for its chip design prowess in that time.
Second, Nvidia could achieve higher margins, as the professor doesn't account for much expansion there. But it's also possible margins could expand, given that some chip giants like Texas Instruments have achieved operating margins near 50%.
In any case, the professor's reality check may be playing a part in Nvidia's sell-off today; however, as is the case with any disruptive growth stock, there is a high amount of uncertainty, both to the upside and downside. Yet after Nvidia's massive run this year, it may be prudent for investors to acknowledge the company's lofty valuation and risk to the downside.

June 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes rose on Tuesday, as megacap stocks recovered and upbeat capital goods orders data allayed concerns about a slowing U.S. economy in the face of Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes.
A Commerce Department report showed orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 0.7% in May, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast orders would remain unchanged.
New home sales and consumer confidence data are due later in the day.
""The sentiment is building that the Fed is certainly near the end of its rate hike regime, and markets will be looking for any indication that will help resolve the ambiguity that the Fed presented in the last meeting,"" said Peter Andersen, founder of Andersen Capital Management.
Market participants are also focusing on the European Central Bank Forum in Sintra, Portugal where several key policymakers including Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak this week.
A winning run on Wall Street came to a halt last week after Powell said there were more rate hikes on the cards. Traders have baked in a 76.9% chance the Fed will raise interest rates by 25 bps to 5.25%-5.50% range at its July meeting, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.
Despite the recent market weakness, the main U.S. stock indexes are set to record second-quarter gains, powered by a rally in growth stocks, upbeat earnings reports and hopes that the Fed will soon end its monetary tightening campaign.

2023-06-28 00:00:00+00:00,US mulls new export restriction on computing power in AI chips,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-mulls-new-export-restriction-on-computing-power-in-ai-chips,"By Stephen Nellis and Karen Freifeld
June 28 (Reuters) - U.S. officials are considering tightening an export control rule designed to slow the flow of artificial intelligence chips to China by clamping down on the amount of computing power the chips can have, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The Biden administration last October issued a sweeping set of rules designed to freeze China's semiconductor industry in place while the U.S. pours billions of dollars in subsidies into its own chip industry.
An update to those rules may come by late July, two sources said, but one cautioned that such U.S. actions involving China often get delayed.
The U.S. Commerce department declined to comment.
Nvidia NVDA.O Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on Wednesday at an investors conference, ""Over the long-term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our data center GPUs to China, if implemented, would result in a permanent loss of opportunities for U.S. industry to compete and lead in one of the world’s largest markets and impact on our future business and financial results.""
The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday reported that the Biden administration was considering new restrictions on exporting AI chips to China.
One of the October rules limited the sale in China of chips that can provide the computing power needed to create artificial intelligence technologies similar to ChatGPT, a move that immediately impacted sales of products from Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O, and would likely affect future offerings from Intel Corp INTC.O.
The possible rule tightening would hardest hit Nvidia, whose strong position in the AI chip market helped make it worth $1 trillion earlier this year.
""""We do not anticipate that such additional restrictions, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact on our financial results,"" Nvidia's Kress said on Wednesday.
Questions have arisen about how effective the October rule will be in slowing Chinese companies' development of AI systems.
Nvidia has made special chips for the Chinese market that comply with the October restrictions, but Reuters reported last month that major Chinese companies such as Tencent Holdings 0700.HK plan to use Nvidia's export-compliant chips to cut the time it takes to train huge AI systems by more than half.
The current rule around AI chips involves two restrictions. One restriction focuses on how fast chips can communicate with each other, which is important because AI systems such as ChatGPT require thousands of chips to be chained together. The other restriction focuses on how much computing power the chip can have.
The H800 chip that Nvidia created for the Chinese market, for example, has as much computing power at some settings used in AI work as the company's chip for the rest of the world, but its chip-to-chip speeds are limited, according to a specification sheet seen by Reuters.
Intel declined to comment. AMD declined to comment. Previously, AMD have said the rules will not have an impact on its financial results.

A negative news related to A.I. chip export to China also dampened market participants sentiment. The Dow and the S&P 500 ended in negative territory while the Nasdaq Composite finished in positive zone.
How Did The Benchmarks Perform?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 0.2% to close at 33,852.66. Notably, 14 components of the 30-stock index ended in negative territory, while 16 in positive zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 13,591.75, gaining 0.3% due to strong performance of large-cap technology stocks.
The S&P 500 fell marginally by 1.55 points to end at 4,376.86. Six out of 11 broad sectors of the benchmark ended in negative territory while 5 finished in positive zone. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) tumbled 1.5% while the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) advanced 1%.
The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was up 2.3% to 13.43. A total of 9.89 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 11.57 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.
Powell Reaffirms Tighter Monetary Control
On Jun 28, during a monetary policy session in Sintra, Portugal, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank is likely to pursue multiple hikes in interest rate at an aggressive pace. According to Powell, “We believe there’s more restriction coming. What’s really driving it ... is a very strong labor market.”
The Fed raised the benchmark lending rate from the range of 0-0.25% in March 2022 to the range of 5-5.25% in May 2023. The massive rise in the Fed fund rate was solely aimed to combat a 40-year high inflation. In its latest FOMC meeting in June, the Fed paused rate hike after 10 consecutive increases.
However, in his post-FOMC statement, the Fed Chairman warned that more rate hikes are expected in this year. The inflation rate declined steadily from its peak on June 2022. However, it still remained well above the central bank’s target rate of 2%.
The “dot plot” of the Fed’s June FOMC meeting showed most of the Fed officials are expecting two more rate hike of 25 basis points each. This implies, the Fed fund rate could reach in the range of 5.5-5.75% by the end of 2023. The terminal interest rate likely to settle at 5.625% instead of 5.125% anticipated at the end of May FOMC.
Moreover, last week, central banks of the UK, Switzerland, Norway and Turkey raised their respective benchmark lending rates. Market participants are concerned that higher interest rate will hinder economic activities resulting in global economic recession.
Turmoil in U.S. Chipset Industry
The Wall Street Journal reported that the Biden administration is mulling about renewed restrictions on exports of high-tech A.I.-enabled semiconductors to China. The report said that the Department of Commerce may restrict the shipment of high-end A.I.-enabled chipsets to China in as early as July.
A section of market researchers is concerned that a ban of A.I. chipsets to China not only affect its economic growth but also its military ambitions. This may lead to a geopolitical economic warfare.
Following the news, shares of NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, the leader of the A.I.-enabled semiconductor manufacturers, fell 1.8%. The company generates more than 25% of its revenues from China. As a result, export ban of its most advanced semiconductors may turn a major headwind. NVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2023-06-30 00:00:00+00:00,"Wall St Week Ahead-After first-half rally, stocks' July winning streak on the line",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-st-week-ahead-after-first-half-rally-stocks-july-winning-streak-on-the-line,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - A U.S. stocks rally is cruising into a month that has proven strong in recent years, though equities must navigate employment data and an earnings season that could be precarious, with the Federal Reserve bent on raising U.S. interest rates.
The S&P 500 defied recession fears and a U.S. banking crisis to notch a 15.9% gain in the first half. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC powered ahead 31.7% for its biggest first-half increase in four decades.
Investors betting the upward trend will continue over the next few weeks have recent history on their side. The S&P 500 .SPX has posted a positive return in eight consecutive Julys, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index .NDX has climbed in July for 15 straight years.
""We have had a pretty resilient market in the first half of this year,” said Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. “The market needs one big question answered, and that is what does the economy look like in the back half of the year.”
Several indicators show growing optimism about equities. Positive sentiment in the American Association of Individual Investors survey has come in above its historical average for four straight weeks, while positioning measures tracked by banks have shown investors recently increasing their exposure to stocks.
The Cboe Volatility Index .VIX, which measures investor demand for protection against stock swings, recently hit its lowest level since early 2020.
At the same time, July brings its share of potentially market-moving events. First up is next Friday’s U.S. employment report, which will give investors a snapshot of how the economy is faring after 500 basis points of rate hikes from the Fed since last year, its most aggressive tightening in decades.
Signs of continued solid job growth could reinforce a view that has helped boost markets this year: that the U.S. economy can avoid a severe recession despite the Fed’s tightening.
""The labor market is probably going to end up proving to be the big catalyst for what may happen market-wise and also monetary policy wise,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief executive officer and chief investment officer of Schwab Asset Management.
Second-quarter corporate results will kick off the following week. S&P 500 companies are expected to post an overall drop in earnings of 5.7% from the year-earlier period, according to Refinitiv IBES.
Investors will focus on results from seven tech and other megacap companies, including Apple AAPL.O, Microsoft MSFT.O and Nvidia NVDA.O, whose outsized gains have driven the S&P 500's rise this year.
“To the degree the Magnificent Seven has been carrying this..., those are the multiples most likely to get hit with any sort of warning, any sort of negative announcement,"" said John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management.
The consumer price index report arrives on July 12, a crucial read on inflation before the Fed's July 26 policy decision. The U.S. central bank held rates steady in June and has signaled two more increases are coming this year, including one widely expected in July.
While stocks have so far taken policymakers’ projections of higher rates in stride, that could change if bond yields continue to rise. Benchmark yields recently hit three-month highs, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield last around 3.8%, well over double where it stood at the end of 2021.
Rising yields generally dull the allure of stocks compared to bonds, but in recent months equity valuations have still climbed.
""At some point, this move in interest rates has got to have some consequences for the markets,"" Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, said in a note on Friday.
Those doubts could stem from concern about economic fallout from rate hikes.
Analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management said in a recent note the likelihood of a recession hinges most on monetary policy becoming more restrictive, an eventuality stocks are not priced for.
""With stocks already priced for the near perfection of a soft landing, we see better risk-reward in high-quality bonds over equities,"" the UBS analysts wrote.

2023-07-06 00:00:00+00:00,"If You Like JEPI, You’ll Love This ETF with an 11.8% Yield",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/if-you-like-jepi-youll-love-this-etf-with-an-11.8-yield,"If you like the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI) then you’re going to love its 11.8%-yielding counterpart, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ). What’s the difference between JEPI and JEPQ, and is JEPQ a strong choice for investors to build their portfolios around? Let’s find out. 
What’s the Difference Between JEPI and JEPQ?
JEPI is JPMorgan’s well-known and much-discussed covered-call ETF that yields about 10.5% and pays a monthly dividend that has taken the market by storm since its 2020 launch. With $10 billion in net inflows this year as of late June, it is now the market’s most popular actively-managed ETF.
JEPQ takes a similar approach to JEPI, selling one-month, out-of-the-money call options to generate income and paying a monthly dividend to its holders (investors should be aware that these distribution payments can vary from month to month).
JEPQ sports an even larger dividend yield than JEPI at 11.8%. The ETF is much smaller than JEPI, with about $4 billion in assets under management compared to $28 billion for JEPI. JEPQ is also newer than JEPI, having launched in May of 2022.
The key difference is that while JEPI invests in large-cap U.S. stocks and seeks to deliver a significant portion of the total returns of the S&P 500 (SPX) with less volatility, JEPQ takes a similar approach but instead uses the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) as its investment universe.
Like JEPI, JEPQ sports a 0.35% expense ratio, which is higher than that of many of the popular passively-managed index funds but isn't bad for an actively-managed fund.
Lastly, note that JEPI and JEPQ are run by the same team of portfolio managers.
JEPQ's ""Magnificent"" Portfolio
JEPQ holds 81 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 58.7% of assets. Therefore, JEPQ is much more concentrated than JEPI, where the top 10 holdings make up just 17.5% of assets. For instance, its top two holdings, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), combine to make up almost 25% of the fund.
Below is an overview of JEPQ’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.
Because it is investing in Nasdaq stocks, JEPQ’s portfolio is much more tech-centric than JEPI’s. The much-discussed ""magnificent seven"" (the aforementioned Microsoft and Apple, plus Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)), which have driven much of the overall market’s gains this year, are all present within JEPQ’s top 10 holdings and combine to comprise roughly half of the fund. 
Beyond the magnificent seven, the rest of the fund includes many other large-cap growth stocks, including plenty of software names and semiconductor companies. There are also positions in a few Nasdaq-listed consumer staple stocks, such as Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Pepsico (NASDAQ:PEP), and Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ).
Is JEPQ Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
Turning to Wall Street, JEPQ has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, as 70.6% of analyst ratings are Buys, 26.6% are Holds, and 2.8% are Sells. At $50.46, the average JEPQ stock price target implies 5.3% upside potential.
JEPQ's Performance
JEPQ only launched in May of 2022, so it doesn’t yet have a long track record that potential investors can evaluate. However, it has a strong total return of 24.9% year-to-date and 16.4% over the past year. 
No Free Lunch
As is the case with JEPI, investors should consider the fact that to achieve this high yield, some sacrifices need to be made. By selling covered calls to generate income, JEPQ likely forgoes some upside when the stocks it holds are surging. You can see this dynamic playing out in real time this year, using a basic Nasdaq 100 ETF like the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) as an easily-investable proxy for the Nasdaq.
QQQ has a total return of 40.4% year-to-date, while JEPQ’s total return for 2023 is 24.9%, outperforming JEPQ by a wide margin. QQQ is also outperforming JEPQ over the past year, with a total return of 26.4% versus JEPQ's total return of 16.4%.
A total return of 24.9% just over halfway through the year is not something many investors will complain about, but it has to be said that it lags the total return of a simple Nasdaq ETF like QQQ by a significant margin. The same can be said for the trailing-12 month returns. We don’t know if this gap will persist over time, but for now, it seems fair to say that JEPQ is underperforming the Nasdaq during a bull market.
In fairness to JEPQ, part of its strategy is to mitigate volatility and downside, so it's also possible that we could see JEPQ outperform vanilla Nasdaq ETFs like QQQ during the next bear market. The tech sector and the Nasdaq were in a bear market last year, but JEPQ only launched in May of 2022, nearly midway through the year, so we don't yet know how it would perform during a full market cycle.
Nevertheless, JEPQ's counterpart, JEPI, held up better than the broader market last year, so it does seem likely that JEPQ would be able to do the same.
However, this might be something many investors are okay with. There are many investors out there who like the downside protection that JEPQ offers and are okay with forgoing some capital appreciation in order to achieve this. Furthermore, some income-oriented investors are satisfied with the idea of a double-digit dividend yield and a monthly dividend payment that they can rely on. 
Investor Takeaway
For these reasons, whether an investment in an ETF like JEPQ suits your portfolio depends on your individual preferences and investment goals. Because it gives less exposure to the long-term upside of the market, I wouldn’t make JEPQ my only holding or the largest piece of my portfolio.
However, I am intrigued by the idea of adding the power and ingenuity of many of the world’s top technology companies, like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, to my portfolio with an ETF that also comes with an 11.8% dividend yield.
Because of this combination, JEPQ can fit in nicely as one component of a well-rounded portfolio. JPMorgan explains that JEPQ's role in a portfolio is to add income and provide diversified equity exposure with lower risk while also ""maintaining prospects for capital appreciation,"" and this is a sensible way to look at a vehicle like JEPQ.
While it might not surpass the Nasdaq in terms of total returns, viewing it as a unique asset that substitutes the fixed income component in a portfolio could be worthwhile. This asset can generate income and possibly offer some distinctive exposure in case of a market downturn, making it an attractive option.

2023-07-10 00:00:00+00:00,NVDA Stock Outlook: Bet Against AI-King Nvidia at Your Own Risk,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvda-stock-outlook%3A-bet-against-ai-king-nvidia-at-your-own-risk,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Among major tech stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has undoubtedly gained the most from the emergence of the generative AI mega-trend. Because of accelerating adoption of generative artificial intelligence applications, NVDA stock has rallied 195.6% year-to-date.
However, following the chip stock’s bolt to prices north of $400 per share, resulting in the company joining the “trillion dollar club” (market cap of $1 trillion or more), many investors are concerned that the “AI mania” surrounding this stock is petering out.
My view? They may come in at a more gradual pace from here, but I wouldn’t assume that shares have topped out, and it’s all downhill from here. The reasons for this are twofold.
First, Nvidia has more than one way to capitalize on the aforementioned secular growth trend. Second, there’s another factor that may not yet be fully reflected in the company’s stock price.
NVDA Stock and AI: Substance, Not Hype
While investors have possibly gone overboard pricing-in AI potential in other semiconductor stocks, it’s important to note that the big run-up in the price of Nvidia shares is based as much on “AI substance” as it is on “AI hype.”
Instead of merely pricing in the potential of this company ultimately generating substantial sales/earnings from the sale of AI chips, Nvidia has already done so.
As seen in its most recently released results, AI-related chip sales enabled the company to report double-digit sequential sales growth, even as demand in other end-user markets (such as gaming) remained in a slump.
As I noted last month, besides delivering strong earnings last quarter, Nvidia also provided a massive upward revision to its guidance for the current fiscal quarter (ending July 2023).
Instead of expecting $7.2 billion in revenue, the company expects sales to top $11 billion, thanks to soaring AI chip demand.
With its overall story changing in such a dramatic way, the continued rally with NVDA stock since this earnings report/guidance update dropped on May 24 has been justified. Even better, alongside this catalyst that is still playing out, another strong AI-related catalyst is emerging.
More Than Just Chips
As par for the course with any strong performing stock, there are some taking a contrarian view on NVDA. These Nvidia skeptics have yet to be vindicated. They continue to lie out the bear case, which hinges heavily on shares being in a bubble on the verge of popping.
Why? In the view of NVDA stock skeptics, the market is overestimating the potential size of the AI chip market. These skeptics also argue that there’s an enormous risk that competition will start heating up for this AI chip leader, negatively affecting growth and margins down the road.
However, Nvidia’s rivals remain far from being major challengers, much less competitive threats, to the company’s AI dominance.
Even if AI chip demand growth slows, keep in mind that this company has another way to capitalize on the rise of artificial intelligence. That would be through its newly launched DGX cloud platform.
DGX Cloud enables Nvidia to turn the AI computing power of its chips into a recurring revenue stream. According to Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri, this “AI as a service” platform represents “a significant long term opportunity” for the tech giant.
The Verdict
With this additional AI catalyst in mind, those betting that disappointment will knock NVDA lower may be the ones more likely to experience disappointment (not to mention, big losses).
This is especially the case, when you consider there’s yet another earnings-booster in store. I’m talking about the recovery of demand for Nvidia’s chips among end-users in areas like gaming and PCs.
Demand in these areas softened last year, and has stayed so up until now. However, as macro challenges fade, demand stands to bounce back in a big way.
Putting it all together, it’s easy to see why analysts are forecasting a big earnings jump not just this fiscal year (ending January 2024) but over the next two fiscal years as well.
Poised to stay a winner, enter/add to a NVDA stock position at current prices.

2023-07-11 00:00:00+00:00,5 Solid Semiconductor Stocks to Buy on Rebounding Chip Sales,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-solid-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-on-rebounding-chip-sales,"The semiconductor industry, which has been suffering over the past year, seems to be making a steady rebound. Sales increased for the third consecutive month in May, per the latest report from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).
The rebound seems to have matched economists’ predictions that global semiconductor sales would bottom by the end of the first quarter before making a recovery. Although there are multiple challenges, the semiconductor industry is poised to grow in the coming days.
Semiconductor Sales Steadily Increasing
According to the latest report from SIA, global semiconductor sales totaled $40.7 billion in May, increasing 1.7% from April’s total of $40 billion. Although May’s figures are still down 21.1% year over year, semiconductor sales have now grown for the third consecutive month.
John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO said, “Despite continuing market sluggishness compared to 2022, month-to-month global semiconductor sales inched upward in May for the third consecutive month, sparking optimism for a possible market rebound during the second half of the year.”
Regionally, sales increased across all regions. Sales in China and Europe rose 3.9% and 2%, respectively. In Asia Pacific/Others, Americas and Japan, sales climbed 1.3%, 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively.
Surging demand for electronic goods and the remote working and learning culture, which boosted demand for PCs and other communication devices during the peak of the pandemic, saw semiconductor sales skyrocketing.
However, higher demand and subsequent supply-chain issues owing to the lockdowns soon resulted in a shortage of semiconductors globally and created a turmoil in multiple end-user industries like automobiles, power, lighting and electronics.
The supply-chain crisis, however, got resolved in 2022 and demand fell. The industry has since been suffering. Despite that, 2022 emerged as the best year for the semiconductor industry, with sales climbing 3.2% to $573.5 billion from $555.9 billion in 2021.
Besides several interrelated factors like rising prices, geopolitical tensions and pandemic aftereffects have contributed to the current short-term decline in the semiconductor industry. However, demand is still strong.
The widespread adoption and increased use of consumer electronics worldwide, the growing presence of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) technologies is driving demand for semiconductors, which is likely to further boost demand for semiconductors in the near term.
Out Picks
Given the bright prospects of the industry, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks. Below, are four chip stocks that investors can gain from in the near term.
NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, GPU. Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to AI-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.

2023-07-12 00:00:00+00:00,Synopsys (SNPS) and Intel Collaborate for Design Flows & IP,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/synopsys-snps-and-intel-collaborate-for-design-flows-ip,"Synopsys SNPS recently revealed that its digital and custom design flows are certified for the Intel Corporation’s INTC Intel Foundry Services (“IFS”) Intel 16 process.

2023-07-13 00:00:00+00:00,Why These 7 Stocks Are the Best Ways to Play Tech Right Now,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-these-7-stocks-are-the-best-ways-to-play-tech-right-now,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
With the integration of advanced solutions such as generative artificial intelligence, the best tech stocks to buy have dominated investment-resource-related headlines. However, a common concern currently permeates the digital ecosystem: not wanting to hold the bag.
For example, take a look at the financials for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). By arguably most measures, NVDA represents a top long-term idea for those investing in tech stocks. Thanks to Nvidia’s graphics processors that empower AI initiatives, shares skyrocketed this year. However, at nearly 207% up for the year, it raises the obvious question, is NVDA (and its ilk) overvalued?
It’s difficult to answer otherwise. Right now, NVDA trades at a trailing multiple of nearly 229X and a forward multiple of almost 58X. Both stats rate as overheated for the industry. Therefore, it makes sense to consider high-return tech stocks that haven’t quite enjoyed Nvidia-magnitude success.
To be sure, acquiring undervalued enterprises offers no guarantees of upside. Still, some investors may be comforted with top tech stocks that have yet to buy tickets for the hype train.
TD Synnex (SNX)
Source: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.com
A Fortune 200 company, TD Synnex (NYSE:SNX) is a leading provider of a comprehensive range of distribution, systems design, and integration services for the technology industry to a wide range of enterprises. Per its corporate profile, Synnex operates in numerous countries throughout North and South America, Asia-Pacific, and Europe. Since the start of the year, SNX gained just a hair under 1%.
Put another way, Synnex may be one of the best tech stocks to buy primarily because of its relevance. However, it’s also underappreciated since it plays more of a stagehand role rather than an enterprise that commands headlines like Nvidia. Still, with SNX gaining only a bit more than 8% in the trailing 365 days, bag-holding concerns may be minimal.
On a financial note, Synnex prints a three-year revenue growth rate (on a per-share basis) of 20.4%, above 86.46% of its peers. Also, it enjoys consistent profitability, a hallmark of reliable top tech stocks. Lastly, SNX trades at a forward multiple of 9.03. In contrast, the sector median is 17.38X.
LSI Industries (LYTS)
Source: PX Media / Shutterstock
Based in Cincinnati, Ohio, LSI Industries (NASDAQ:LYTS) is a leading producer of high-performance, American-made lighting solutions. Per its public profile, LSI offers distinct indoor and outdoor products and services, including digital and print graphics capabilities. Its products are used extensively in automotive dealerships, gasoline stations, retail establishments, and sports complexes, to name but a few.
Since the start of the year, LYTS returned its stakeholders a little bit above 1%. To put this figure into context, the benchmark S&P 500 returned nearly 17% during the same period. So, on paper, LYTS doesn’t appear to be moving anywhere. However, the company is quietly printed a three-year revenue growth rate of 8.9%, above 64% of its peers.
Further, the company benefits from a Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9, reflecting decent operational efficiency. Also, its Altman Z-Score of 4.24 indicates a low risk of imminent bankruptcy. Finally, the market prices LYTS at a forward multiple of 12.51. In contrast, the sector median is 17.38. Thus, it’s one of the best tech stocks to buy.
DHI Group (DHX)

A leading provider of career marketplaces for technology professionals across various industries, DHI Group (NYSE:DHX) seeks to empower tech professionals and organizations to compete and win through expert insights and relevant employment connections. Established in 1990, DHI’s ultimate vision centers on matching the highest-quality candidates with the appropriate client career opportunities.
While DHX might not rank as a direct player among the best tech stocks to buy, it’s still worth serious consideration. After all, when it comes to any organization, it’s all about people, people, people. In full disclosure, though, DHX presents high risks. Since the Jan. opener, shares cratered nearly 29%. Still, it might offer an upside for the daring.
Notably, DHI is a growth machine. Last year, the company posted revenue of $149.7 million and net income of $4.2 million. These stats compared favorably to 2021’s sales haul of $119.9 million and a net loss of $29.7 million.
Even with the strong top-line performance, DHX trades at a revenue multiple of 1.09. In contrast, the underlying sector median stands at 2.4X. So, for gamblers of high-return tech stocks, it’s worth a closer examination.
Tower Semiconductor (TSEM)
Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.com
Calling Israel home, Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) is the leader in high-value analog semiconductor foundry solutions. According to its corporate profile, Tower provides technology and manufacturing platforms for integrated circuits (ICs) in growing markets such as consumer, industrial, automotive, mobile, infrastructure, medical and aerospace, and defense. Since the start of the year, TSEM slipped a bit more than 13%.
Nevertheless, Tower could offer one of the best tech stocks to buy for those completely uninterested in acquiring overheated securities. Plus, the company isn’t quite as bad as it may look in the charts. For example, Tower features a cash-to-debt ratio of 3.88, above 61% of its peers. Also, its equity-to-asset ratio clocks in at 0.77, better than 72.1% of sector players.
As well, the company is consistently profitable (especially recently), providing confidence for prospective buyers. If that wasn’t enough, the market prices TSEM at a forward multiple of 18.01. As a discount to projected earnings, Tower ranks better than 67.91% of the competition. If you’re investing in tech stocks but want a solid discount, TSEM should be on your radar.
Magic Software (MGIC)
Source: shutterstock.com/CC7
Another Israeli company, Magic Software (NASDAQ:MGIC) is a global provider of powerful and versatile end-to-end, on-premises, and cloud-based integration and low-code application development platforms. Per its public profile, Magic commands over 30 years of experience. As well, it features 24 regional offices, millions of installations worldwide, and strategic alliances with global IT leaders.
Since the beginning of this year, MGIC fell more than 20%. In the trailing one-year period, Magic shares tumbled over 31%, meaning that it’s only one of the best tech stocks for speculators. However, it’s specifically for speculators who wish to avoid NVDA-style premiums.
You’re not going to get that with MGIC. According to data from Yahoo Finance, the market prices shares at trailing earnings multiple of 15.65. In contrast, the sector median stat comes in at a much loftier 27.93X. Also, MGIC trades at an enterprise value (EV) to revenue ratio of 1.07X. However, the sector median clocks in at 2.26X.
Lastly, Magic delivers very solid revenue and EBITDA growth over the past three years. Additionally, it’s consistently profitable, making it a worthwhile pick for tech stocks to buy.
Concentrix (CNXC)
Source: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com
While incredibly risky, Concentrix (NASDAQ:CNXC) makes a case for the best tech stocks for not holding the bag. That’s because those who jumped aboard CNXC earlier this year ended up holding the proverbial carrier. Since the Jan. opener, CNXC fell just over 36%. Interestingly, over the past five years, the security ended up gaining only 6.2%. However, that’s when contrarian ears might perk up.
According to its corporate profile, Concentrix is a leading technology-enabled global business services company specializing in customer engagement and improving business performance for some of the world’s best brands. These include over 95 Global Fortune 500 clients and over 90 global disruptor clients.
On the operational side, Concentrix prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.3%, better than 56.42% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same frame clocks in at 17.8%, above 64.45% of software players. Even better, CNXC trades at a forward multiple of 7.31. As a discount to projected earnings, Concentrix ranks superior to 95.39% of the competition. If you’re looking for a high-growth rebound name, CNXC could rank among the top tech stocks.
KVH Industries (KVHI)
Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com
Another risky idea but compelling idea for the best tech stocks to buy, KVH Industries (NASDAQ:KVHI) is a global leader in mobile connectivity and inertial navigation systems, with innovative technology designed to enable a mobile world. According to management, KVH also represents a premier manufacturer of high-performance sensors and integrated inertial systems for defense and commercial applications. Unfortunately, Wall Street isn’t feeling KVHI right now.
Since the January opener, shares tumbled almost 16%. In the past 60 months, they gave up nearly 34% of equity value. Much of the pain centers on its lackluster revenue performance thus far. For instance, in 2021, sales slipped to $133.9 million, down 15.6% against 2020’s tally. And at $138.9 million, last year’s sales haul wasn’t that much better.
Still, it’s worth giving KVH a shot if you’re a contrarian. Primarily, the company benefits from a robust balance sheet. Its cash-to-debt ratio stands at nearly 39X, ranked better than 87% of its peers. Also, its Piotroski F-Score comes in at 7 out of 9, reflecting decent operational efficiency. Lastly, KVHI trades at a tangible book multiple of 1.09X. In contrast, the sector median stat stands at 2.09X.

2023-07-14 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-US chip CEOs plan Washington trip to talk China policy - sources,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-us-chip-ceos-plan-washington-trip-to-talk-china-policy-sources-0,"By Stephen Nellis, Andrea Shalal and Karen Freifeld
July 14 (Reuters) - The chief executives of Intel Corp INTC.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O are planning to visit Washington next week to discuss China policy, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
The executives plan to hold meetings with U.S. officials to talk about market conditions, export controls and other matters affecting their businesses, one of the sources said. It was not immediately clear whom the executives would meet.
Intel and Qualcomm declined to comment, and officials at the White House did not immediately return a request for comment.
The sources said other semiconductor CEOs may also be in Washington next week. The sources declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
The Biden administration last October issued a sweeping set of rules designed to freeze China's semiconductor industry in place while the U.S. pours billions of dollars in subsidies into its own chip industry.
The possible rule tightening would hit Nvidia particularly hard. The company's strong position in the AI chip market helped boost its worth to $1 trillion earlier this year.
The chip industry has been warmly received in Washington in recent years as lawmakers and the White House work to shift more production to the U.S. and its allies, and away from China. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon have met often with government officials.
Next week's meetings, which one of the sources said could include joint sessions between executives and U.S. officials, come as Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and other chip companies fear a permanent loss of sales for an industry with large amounts of business in China while tensions escalate between Washington and Beijing.
Many U.S. chip firms get more than one-fifth of their revenue from China, and industry executives have argued that reducing those sales would cut into profits that they reinvest into research and development.

July 17 (Reuters) - The U.S.-based Semiconductor Industry Association trade group on Monday called on the Biden administration to ""refrain from further restrictions"" on chip sales to China as chief executives from the biggest U.S. semiconductor firms planned to visit Washington this week to press their views on China policy.
The statement came as the Biden administration considers updating a sweeping set of rules imposed in October to hobble China's chip industry and a new executive order restricting some outbound investment. Reuters reported last week that the chief executives of Intel Corp INTC.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.Oplanned to meet with government officials to discuss their views on China policy.
The statement also comes after China moved to restrict exports of raw materials such as gallium and germanium that are used in making chips. The industry group said that further rule-tightening by U.S. officials risks ""disrupting supply chains, causing significant market uncertainty, and prompting continued escalatory retaliation by China.""
The industry group said it wants ""the administration to refrain from further restrictions until it engages more extensively with industry and experts to assess the impact of current and potential restrictions to determine whether they are narrow and clearly defined, consistently applied, and fully coordinated with allies.”

2023-07-18 00:00:00+00:00,3 Nasdaq Stocks to Watch After Index Rebalancing,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-nasdaq-stocks-to-watch-after-index-rebalancing,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The Nasdaq index rebalancing will change the weights of key stocks within the fund. Big tech stocks will have a lower concentration within the index. Some investors believe the rebalance is long overdue, with six stocks currently markup up 50% of the Nasdaq 100’s assets. The index rebalancing will reduce these corporations to 40% of the index’s portfolio.
This rebalancing act will strengthen the index’s diversification. However, it also presents a short-term opportunity for savvy investors. The other Nasdaq stocks now have a chance to shine since more shares must get purchased to rebalance the index. This short-term activity can push their prices higher.
The readjustment will be completed on July 24th, giving investors a narrow window to capitalize on the opportunity. These three Nasdaq stocks seem poised to make up a higher percentage of the popular index and reward long-term investors.
Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)

Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a high-flying growth stock that has more than doubled over the past five years. The company creates robotic products for clinical services and is also a part of the S&P 500.
The company reported 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter, an improvement from recent quarters. Net income declined from $366 million in Q1 2022 to $355 in the first quarter. This decrease is smaller than declines from prior quarters.
The company’s da Vinci procedures grew by 26% year-over-year. Despite disruptions during the pandemic, Intuitive Surgical has reported a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 18% for da Vinci procedures between the first quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2023.
Broadcom (AVGO)
Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor stock that is poised to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. In the first quarter, Broadcom reported higher revenue, net income, and profit margins than Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Despite the better earnings, Broadcom carries a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27 times, while Nvidia’s P/E is over 200 times.
Broadcom has similar opportunities as Nvidia, and both companies can be the top winners in AI. A Nasdaq index rebalance will distribute funds allocated for Nvidia stock to other companies. Since Broadcom has similar market opportunities, a strong business model, and long-term stock price appreciation, the Nasdaq 100 rebalance may involve replacing some Nvidia shares with Broadcom shares.
AVGO stock returns have exceeded 300% over the past five years. A Nasdaq 100 rebalancing can help those high returns continue.
Zscaler (ZS)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) is a volatile growth stock that features excellent revenue growth but net losses. The cloud security company is up by over 60% since the start of May and can benefit from a Nasdaq index rebalance.
The company reported 46% year-over-year revenue growth in the most recent quarter. Total revenue came in at $418.8 million, while net losses came in at $46.0 million. Net losses for speculative growth companies are concerning, but if these companies can flip the switch to profitability, they can gain value quickly.
Zscaler’s net loss represents a significant improvement. The company reported a $101.4 million net loss in the same quarter last year. The company’s leadership offered guidance for $429 – $431 million in revenue for the following quarter. Those numbers imply 34.9% to 35.5% year-over-year revenue growth. The guidance suggests more revenue deceleration, but Zscaler has exceeded revenue guidance before.
A Nasdaq rebalancing can help this stock gain short-term momentum. The recent spike in share price and this stock’s status as a top performer during the pandemic make it a great momentum play to consider. However, the company will have to become profitable soon or accelerate its revenue again to be a more compelling long-term buy.

The artificial intelligence (AI) game shows no signs of slowing. In fact, we’re still in the early innings. Even Analysts at Bank of America say AI is on the brink of an “iPhone moment” and could boost the global economy by $15.7 trillion. It could also send AI stocks to higher highs.
For just an idea of how powerful the AI trend has become, look at what happened with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on Tuesday. The tech giant announced a $30 per month subscription for the use of generative AI with Microsoft 365 — and exploded. In fact, MSFT soared around $14 a share on the day. Since late April, it’s up 29%. Or, look at Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which ran from about $300 to $475 since May.
Granted, those two stocks alone are still very much worth buying and holding. Both could easily see another $100 of upside this year alone and still create obscene wealth. However, if you’re looking at smaller stocks with the potential to turn $5,000 into $1 million, take a look at these three AI stocks.
AI Stocks: Palantir Technologies (PLTR)
Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com
The last time I mentioned Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), it traded at around $9.50. Today, it’s up to $18.08 and could see higher highs — all thanks to the AI boom.
Helping, Mizuho analyst Matt Broome recently boosted his price target on the PLTR stock to $14 from $8. He also believes the company is “likely well-placed to manage secure AI deployments for its customers,” as noted by MarketWatch.com. Better, in its first quarter earnings release, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Alex Karp said, “The depth of engagement with and demand for our new Artificial Intelligence Platform is without precedent.”
Better, first-quarter earnings were solid. The company posted revenue of $525 million, up 18% year-over-year. That beat the company’s guidance range and the Street’s estimate for $506 million. Adjusted EPS came in at five cents, or a penny better than expectations. For the second quarter, PLTR sees revenue falling in the range of $528 million and $532 million. It also expects to be GAAP profitable in the second, third, and fourth quarters. With full-year revenue, the company sees income from $2.185 billion to $2.235 billion.
With AI demand now in overdrive, PLTR could be on the verge of a big move — especially with the AI market expected to balloon to $1.81 trillion by 2030.
Marvell Technology (MRVL)
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com
Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) has been just as explosive. Since late April, the MRVL stock ran from about $37.50 to $65.76 and could still race higher. Even Oppenheimer analysts say it could benefit from its AI exposure. The firm reiterated an outperform rating on the stock, with a price target of $70 a share. MRVL also said it’s still in the early stages of its AI ramp and even forecasted fiscal 2024 revenue to at least double from the prior year — and grow.
Earnings and guidance have been solid for Marvell, as well. In its April quarter, the company posted adjusted EPS of 31 cents, compared to expectations of 29 cents. Revenue jumped to $1.32 billion, compared to expectations of $1.3 billion. Guidance was just as good, with the company forecasting revenue to come in around $1.33 billion, which is also above Street forecasts for $1.31 billion.
SoundHound AI (SOUN)
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock
Or, we can look at SoundHound (NASDAQ:SOUN) again. Not to sound like a broken record, but as I noted on July 18, “the company is working with the auto industry, which could help place voice assistants into most vehicles.” Also, thanks to what the company called an “incredible surge in demand for conversational AI,” which I have mentioned before, the company recently saw a 56% increase in revenue year over year.
Even better, SOUN just announced that its SoundHound for Restaurants’ voice AI technology is available for integration with Oracle MICROS Simphony Point-of-Sale (POS) for Restaurants. As a recent company press release noted, Chief Product Officer and Co-Founder of SoundHound James Hom said, “restaurants are looking to voice technology to help drive sales, support employees and create a great customer experience. SoundHound’s advanced voice AI allows them to do just that with minimal onboarding and at a reasonable cost.”
Since March, SOUN ran from about $1.60 to a recent high of $5.11. After pulling back to $3.69, the stock is currently consolidating in a tightly coiled spring. From here, I’d like to see SOUN retest $5.11 and potentially see the double-digits shortly after.

2023-07-20 00:00:00+00:00,3 AI Stocks for Getting Rich in 2023,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-ai-stocks-for-getting-rich-in-2023,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
With businesses and countries across the world elevating artificial intelligence (AI) to enjoy higher revenue and growth, investors are also on the lookout for AI stocks that have massive upside potential. Self-driving cars, robotics, gaming or machine learning, you name it and AI is present there. It has become a part of every industry and is only going to expand in the coming years. If you look at the potential of AI, we are just scratching the surface right now. According to PWC, AI can contribute $15.7 trillion to the economy by 2030. The report also states that the greatest economic gains from AI will be in China, followed by North America. 
While AI is everywhere, not every company that invests in it is set to benefit. If you are thinking of investing in AI, you need to keep in mind that there are only a few companies that offer solid growth opportunities and have a positive long-term outlook. Here are three AI stocks to buy for getting rich in 2023.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), an extremely powerful company, is leading the AI race and is at the forefront with its powerful technology. While the stock might look expensive right now, with Nvidia, you will get what you pay for. It is trading at $474 today and is up over 200% since the beginning of the year. One of the high potential AI stocks, NVDA stock started the year at $143 and has now hit $474, making several investors rich. 
The company is growing at a ridiculously rapid pace and reported a revenue of $7 billion in the first quarter. It has invested heavily into AI and with the rising demand of its chip powered applications, Nvidia is going to see higher growth in the next few years. The company isn’t at the top today but is on the road to massive success. There was a point of time when gaming was the biggest source of revenue for the company. It then moved toward the data center and despite a drop in gaming revenue, the company continues to see steady growth in the data center segment. It produced a revenue of $4.28 billion while the gaming segment produced $2.24 billion. 
With the increase of generative AI applications, the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) is on the rise – and Nvidia has the power to increase the prices as well. The company recently invested $50 million in Recursion, which led to the recent stock rally. It is a company that specializes in accelerated computing and this investment will allow it to work on AI models of Chemistry and Biology. Currently, it is difficult to dethrone Nvidia, and if you are looking for AI stocks to invest in this year, buy NVDA. 
Microsoft (MSFT) 
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
There is nobody unaware of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and its products. It has become difficult to run a business without using at least one of Microsoft’s products. If you are considering tech industry investing, Microsoft is the one to pick. The numbers are proof of how well Microsoft is doing. It reported a revenue of $52.9 billion and a net income of 18.3 billion, both better than the same quarter the previous year. Already an early investor in AI, the company’s Intelligent Cloud Segment shined through and brought in $22.1 billion in revenue.
Besides the investment in OpenAI, Microsoft is also developing its own AI chip named Athena. This chip will have the ability to power the technology behind AI chatbots. By producing chips, the company will be able to save money that goes into buying chips from other vendors. If the chips perform well, it will put Microsoft into direct competition with Nvidia. 
MSFT stock is not cheap – it is exchanging hands at $359 today and is already up 50% year to date. Despite being expensive, the future of this stock looks bright. It has generated over 200% returns in the past five years. The stock surged after the company announced that it will charge $30 a month for its generative AI features. This fee will boost the company’s revenue in the near-term. In a recent memo, the company stated that it plans to grow its revenue by at least 10% through 2030 and this means it will be able to generate over $500 billion in revenue by the end of this decade. If it hits this target, we will see the stock hit a new all-time high. Microsoft is set to announce results next week and the stock could move higher then. 
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

It is not possible to talk about AI stocks without mentioning Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The company is a direct competitor of Nvidia and is here to challenge its dominance. If you think NVDA stock is too expensive, consider investing in AMD stock because it has the potential to reach the same highs. The company is already succeeding with its chips and its recently revealed MI300 is here to change the way cloud data centers run AI applications. The performance of this chip drew Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) attention – and they could be using it for Amazon Web Services very soon. This could give a huge boost to the stock. 
Another reason to bet on AMD is its diversified business model. The company has revenue flowing in from multiple streams and it could also use AI for gaming, potentially transforming the gaming experience of every user. AMD stock is trading at $117 today and is up 84% year to date.  The company has strong financials and it reported a quarterly revenue of $5.4 billion – a 9% year-over-year drop; however, I believe this loss is only temporary. It will be interesting to see the second-quarter results from the company. AMD has all it takes to inch closer to Nvidia and has a solid leadership that can make it happen, too. It isn’t too far behind and if you want to get rich, AMD stock is definitely one to own.

NVIDIA Declares $0.04 Dividend
On May 24, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share ($0.16 annualized). Shareholders of record as of June 8, 2023 received the payment on June 30, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.04 per share.
At the current share price of $443.09 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.04%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.18%, the lowest has been 0.02%, and the highest has been 0.50%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.13 (n=236).
The current dividend yield is 1.15 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.09. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

Artificial intelligence (AI) adoption has the potential to boost productivity growth significantly, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). These three rapidly growing AI stocks offer immense potential, with their current stock prices yet to fully reflect it. The global AI market is projected to reach $1,812 billion by 2030, making it an opportune time to consider investing in AI stocks.
Of course, not all AI stocks may be good buys in the near or medium term. Valuations across the sector have run hot, meaning this is a difficult sector to time right now.
However, for those thinking truly long-term, here are three top picks in this sector that may be worth holding onto and buying for the next decade or two.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leader in the AI space, and its products are used for data centers, gaming, and autonomous driving. The world’s largest chip maker by market capitalization has been the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 during the first half of 2023, with a 211% gain. The company’s success can be attributed to its chips and semiconductors driving artificial intelligence applications. The market value of NVDA has crossed $1 trillion, reaffirming the business’s status as a mega-cap software corporation.
Despite the impressive performance, analysts believe there is still potential for growth as Nvidia continues to capitalize on the AI trend, including the introduction of the powerful DGX GH200 supercomputer.
Analysts at KeyBanc (NYSE:KEY) have increased their price target for Nvidia, recognizing the company’s success in the semiconductor industry and its strong presence in artificial intelligence. Wall Street analysts are still optimistic about Nvidia amid worries about the stock’s price due to the sector’s explosive development in artificial intelligence. Nvidia holds at least an 80% market share in AI chips and is favored by major companies like Google and Microsoft.
The increasing demand for AI chips has contributed to Nvidia’s strong financial performance and positive guidance. Analysts have raised their price targets for Nvidia, indicating the potential for further growth.
Microsoft (MSFT)

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has the potential to reach $400 per share, driven by its potential acquisition of a renowned video game developer and its integration of generative artificial intelligence tools. While there are no guarantees, Microsoft is expected to provide growth and value to its investors.
MSFT stock reaching $400 in the near future should come as no surprise, given Microsoft’s reputation as an early adopter of AI technology. The ongoing acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) is a significant catalyst in the equation. Microsoft has advanced against legal hurdles, winning recognition from the U.S. and clearance from the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority. The recent rejection of the FTC’s attempt to block the deal further strengthens Microsoft’s position. These developments bode well for Microsoft and its stakeholders.
Moreover, Microsoft’s stock has experienced a 44% year-to-date rise. It was partially fueled by the strong growth of its cloud computing platform Azure, which grew by a whopping 27% in Q1. Microsoft is well-positioned to benefit from the burgeoning computer science sector because of its strong cloud software and IT skills.
Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com
Despite lagging behind other tech stocks, such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Nvidia, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) presents a potential opportunity for investors seeking undervalued stocks. With a 50% gain since January and its stock below its 52-week high, there may still be room for Amazon to recover and experience further growth.
Wall Street believes that Amazon still has untapped growth potential. While the company may not be making headlines for groundbreaking AI integrations, it has been using AI to enhance its core businesses for years. From product recommendations to improving retail experiences, Amazon sees the value in leveraging generative AI algorithms to better serve customers. This ongoing enthusiasm and dedication to AI-driven innovation position Amazon for continued success in the market.
As far as long-term tech juggernauts are concerned, Amazon remains among the most steady long-term picks investors can buy at relatively attractive valuations. In Amazon’s case, the company’s valuation isn’t cheap, but relatively cheap compared to its historical average. This is one stock I hold for the long term, and I think it is worth buying up to its previous all-time high.
On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald held a long position in AMZN, META. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.
Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.

2023-07-26 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia's Newest Service Makes It Easier Than Ever to Train AI -- What Investors Need to Know,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidias-newest-service-makes-it-easier-than-ever-to-train-ai-what-investors-need-to-know,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the company traditionally known for designing chips for high-end video game graphics on PCs, has ushered in a new era of AI. The generative AI chatbot ChatGPT quickly picked up tens of millions of users starting in late 2022, creating ballooning interest in other generative AI services -- nearly all of which are ""trained"" using Nvidia semiconductor systems.
What followed was an epic financial report unlike anything seen before. Cloud infrastructure companies are all scrambling to buy as many AI training chips as they can get their hands on. But Nvidia has a new way to access its hardware that makes AI easier and more affordable to train than ever before: DGX Cloud.
Wait, what is generative AI?
Let's get up to speed on what generative AI services like ChatGPT are. AI-powered software has been around for decades, quietly working behind the scenes to do things like organize and present information on the internet or auto-fill words while users type in a word document.
Generative AI is a newer sub-field of artificial intelligence in which computer software is used to ""create"" new content. There are lots of iterations of it. It could be a user typing in text to prompt the AI to create more text (known as text-to-text), a text-to-image or text-to-video prompt that creates new visuals, image-to-video, video-to-text, or really any iteration that can be imagined. Generative AI is even used to translate speech in real time, power self-driving cars, and even to create software code, with the user explaining what they want the software to do using simple everyday language.

Nvidia opens the door to new possibilities
The software algorithms that can accomplish this content creation (known as large language models, or LLMs) first need to be ""trained."" This is where Nvidia comes in. Using massive amounts of data, like that found on the internet or from a company's own private digital information, the LLM algorithms are trained in how to respond to user prompts by tracking relationships in sequential data, be it text in a sentence or sequential frames of video.
Nvidia helped pioneer this work with over a decade and a half of research and development into data center supercomputing. Its video game chips (GPUs, or graphics processing units) can shred through massive amounts of data, so the company figured out how to apply these GPUs to data centers (a data center becomes part of ""the cloud"" when data and software stored on it is accessed via an internet connection).
However, up to this point, a company or start-up that wanted to train generative AI would need to purchase and install a great deal of data center infrastructure. This can get ridiculously expensive. Nvidia's latest flagship system alone, called the H100, can cost upward of $40,000 -- and that's just one piece of the infrastructure needed for AI training! A DGX SuperPod (which utilizes many H100s along with other chips) reportedly starts at about $7 million and can cost as much as $60 million.

DGX Cloud aims to solve this problem. Rather than a company needing to purchase and set up its own expensive data center, it can now rent access to Nvidia's AI training infrastructure and related software on a monthly basis. After testing early access with some early adopter businesses, DGX Cloud is now broadly available via subscription to Oracle's Cloud and through Nvidia's own infrastructure in the U.S. and U.K.
A game changer for Nvidia
Generative AI can have transformative use cases across all industries of the global economy. Some research points toward AI soon adding $4 trillion in economic value every year. It's difficult to quantify what exactly that means, but the early results are quite tangible for Nvidia. The company reported revenue of $7.2 billion in its last quarter, but anticipates revenue to be some $4 billion more in the next quarter alone (to about $11 billion in total quarterly sales) due mostly to generative AI infrastructure demand.
While management didn't provide specific guidance for the second half of the current fiscal year, CFO Colette Kress said Nvidia has ""procured substantially higher supply for the second half of the year"" from its manufacturing partners. Suffice to say Nvidia's revenue is poised to rocket to new all-time highs this year and next. Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently doled out praise for Nvidia, saying the electric vehicle leader would take as many Nvidia GPUs as it could get, but that Nvidia has many other customers it has to prioritize, too.
This explains the wild optimism surrounding Nvidia stock right now. Shares trade for well over 40 times Wall Street analysts' expectations for next year's earnings. It's a premium price tag to be sure, so investors should tread carefully. There's limited visibility on just how much money Nvidia is going to haul in from its generative AI infrastructure, let alone its brand new DGX Cloud subscription service. But one thing's for sure: Nvidia has ushered in a new era of AI, and it's well positioned to continue carrying the torch for this movement for years to come.

  In this episode of ETF Spotlight, I speak with Tiffany Ng, Portfolio Manager at Renaissance Capital, a global IPO investment advisory firm.
The IPO market is waking up from a long slumber. After a disastrous performance in 2022, the Renaissance IPO ETF IPO is up more than 44% year-to-date. Some of the recent IPOs, such as Mediterranean food chain Cava CAVA and online beauty-products retailer ODDITY Tech ODD, had quite a successful public debut.
With stocks surging to new highs and inflation starting to ease, investors are warming up to IPOs again. In the second quarter of 2023, 23 IPOs raised a combined $6.6 billion, marking the highest proceeds in six quarters, according to Renaissance.
British chip designer Arm is reportedly planning a listing later this year with Nvidia NVDA as an anchor investor. Softbank-backed Arm, whose customers include Apple AAPL and Qualcomm QCOM, is likely to be the most valuable company to go public this year.
IPO ETFs provide diversified exposure to newly public companies before they join other core US equity indexes. For instance, Google GOOGL and Facebook META were included in the S&P 500 index about two years after going public, while Tesla TSLA was included 10 years after its IPO.
The Renaissance IPO ETF IPO holds the largest, most liquid newly-listed U.S. IPOs. Companies that have been public for three years are removed at the next quarterly review.
The First Trust US Equity Opportunities ETF FPX holds the 100 largest and most liquid U.S. IPOs, including spin-offs. Eligible stocks are purchased after the close on the 6th trading day and held for about four years. It is up about 18% this year.

2023-07-31 00:00:00+00:00,"The Easiest Way to Remember the ""Magnificent 7"" Stocks -- And Why You Should Care",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-easiest-way-to-remember-the-magnificent-7-stocks-and-why-you-should-care,"Those handy-dandy short lists of the most important stocks on the market are great. They don't last forever, though. The FAANG club is getting long in the tooth, so Wall Street came up with a new elite group. The Magnificent 7 rolls off the tongue, but the name doesn't hold many clues to the identity of the seven components.
So I'm here to straighten it out for you. I will forevermore think of the Magnificent 7 as the MAMA ANT stocks. The queen of Wall Street's stock hive even breaks down into two distinct groups, making it even easier to remember.
In a couple of minutes, you'll be able to rattle off the seven members in your sleep -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).
Easy peasy. Let me show you what I mean.
The MAMA ANT mnemonic
So the Magnificent 7 list corresponds to the absolute top of the market right now, but that could change in a heartbeat. Bubbling right below the smallest of these giants, you'll find Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, financial services veteran Visa, and health insurance behemoth UnitedHealth Group. They all use AI tools, of course, but none look like direct beneficiaries of the AI surge, and I would never classify them as tech stocks. So you could memorize the top of the market cap list, but that list could go obsolete at the drop of a chatbot's hat.
So if you want to keep an eye on the Magnificent 7 in the long run, you'll be better off with a proper acronym. And that's where my MAMA ANT idea comes in.
It's a short, snappy phrase with two common English words. The queen of an ant colony is extremely important to the health of the whole community, and these seven stocks have a similar role in today's stock market. Best of all, the two words come with distinctly different groups of business plans.
The MAMA group focuses on software and services above all else, including the three largest cloud computing platforms:
Microsoft (software and cloud computing)
Amazon (e-commerce and cloud computing)
Meta Platforms (social media)
Alphabet (Google parent)
And the ANT list lives on the hardware side of the tracks:
Apple (iPhones, iPads)
Nvidia (semiconductors)
Tesla (electric vehicles and solar power)
There you have it -- an easy-to-remember list of the most important AI stocks in the first half of 2023.
What's the big deal with these 7 stocks, anyway?
Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett coined the ""Magnificent 7"" term two months ago. Though it may sound like a compliment, Hartnett warned investors that this group of seven heavyweights seem to spearhead a ""baby bubble"" that could pop soon. Most of the stocks on his list have scored big gains in 2023 for two main reasons: a stabilizing economy and the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom.
So you shouldn't see the list as an outright recommendation to buy these massive stocks. However, the seven members most certainly deserve a generous serving of respect. These numbers tell the story:
COMPANY
MARKET CAP (BILLIONS)
S&P 500 WEIGHT
Apple
$3,080
7.5%
Microsoft
$2,515
6.5%
Amazon
$1,357

Nvidia
$1,155

Alphabet Class A

Alphabet Class C

1.8%
Meta Platforms
$835
1.8%
Tesla
$834
1.8%
Data source: Slickcharts.com on July 31, 2023.
These seven companies (and eight stocks due to Alphabet's dual-class ownership structure) have a combined market cap of $13.2 trillion. In the cap-weighted S&P 500, they account for 27.4% of the total index value. So when these elephants dance, the earth shakes on Wall Street.
At the end of 2022, the MAMA ANT stocks added up to a market value of $8 trillion. So this group has delivered an average return of 64% year to date, far outpacing the 19% return of the S&P 500 as a whole.
Today, these are the most valuable stocks on the market. They are also among this year's strongest market performers. Microsoft brings up the rear with a 41% year-to-date return. That's the 45th-highest gain among all S&P 500 stocks. At the top of the list, Nvidia has gained 221% over the same period.
They also share a close connection to the booming AI market. That's the train they rode to the top in 2023, and Hartnett doesn't like the intensely concentrated market risk this grouping brings to the most popular market index.
The analyst suggests that the AI market may be setting itself up for a painful correction when the skyrocketing surge runs out of steam. The dot-com bubble at the turn of the millennium springs to mind, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index took 15 years to recover from the peak of that short-lived surge.
Hartnett's bearish argument makes sense to some degree. The AI bonanza is almost certainly pushing some stocks skyward with more enthusiasm than they deserve. Yes, AI tools will change the business world in a myriad different ways, but so did the internet 20 years ago and that game-changing market shift was still painful. Every AI stock won't be a winner, and there are probably a couple of weak long-term ideas on the MAMA ANT list.
So I don't know how long MAMA ANT will be helpful and relevant, but the queen ant should at least serve as a useful launching point for deeper research into the AI-based stock surge. It's a good idea to sort the long-term winners out from the overhyped wannabes.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2023-08-02 00:00:00+00:00,US STOCKS-Wall Street ends lower as investors step back after Fitch downgrades US,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-street-ends-lower-as-investors-step-back-after-fitch-downgrades-us,"By David French
Aug 2 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed down on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lower for a second straight day, with investors taking profits on five months of gains a day after rating agency Fitch cut the U.S. government's credit rating.
Fitch downgraded the United States to AA+ from AAA late on Tuesday, citing expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years as well as growing government debt. Fitch was the second major agency to cut the country's rating. In 2011 Standard & Poor's stripped the country of its triple-A grade.
Several major brokerages said the downgrade was unlikely to result in a sustained drag on U.S. financial markets, noting that the economy was now stronger than it was in 2011.
July was the fifth straight month of gains for the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite .IXIC, driven by better-than-expected earnings and hopes of a soft landing for the U.S. economy.
However, with markets entering a seasonally slow August, the Fitch downgrade offered an opportunity for investors to take a breather.
""Sometimes it's healthy to have this digestion in the market, as it brings down valuations a bit and it allows for dip-buying,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Rate-sensitive megacap stocks, including Tesla TSLA.O, Nvidia NVDA.O, Meta Platforms META.O and Apple AAPL.O, tumbled, as the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR rose to its highest in nearly nine months. US/
The technology index .SPLRCT was also the worst performer of the 11 major S&P sectors.
Yields being above 4% is ""not what the market wants to see"", according to LPL's Krosby, who also predicted investors will soon look beyond Fitch's downgrade and turn their focus to big tech company earnings due after the close on Thursday.
""The market is now going to focus on Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Apple tomorrow afternoon, and then on the payroll report on Friday, and we'll say goodbye to Fitch,"" Krosby said.
ROBOT
Meanwhile, the ADP National Employment report showed private payrolls increased more than expected in July, pointing to continued labor market resilience that could shield the economy from a recession.
Despite lingering fears of a recession, corporate America has continued to perform well. With around two-thirds of the S&P 500 having already reported, 79.9% have posted earnings above analysts' expectations, per Refinitiv I/B/E/S.
This puts the quarter on track for the highest earnings beat rate since the third quarter of 2021, per the data provider.
On the earnings front, CVS Health CorpCVS.Ngained after beating Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit, boosted by strength in its pharmacy benefit management unit and lower-than-expected medical costs in its health insurance business.
EmersonEMR.N climbed after the industrial software firm raised its annual profit outlook as companies increase spending on automation in response to a tight labor market.
Elsewhere, Wells FargoWFC.N said it expects to pay as much as $1.8 billion to help replenish a government deposit insurance fund that was drained of $16 billion this year after three banks collapsed, sending its shares lower.
Advanced Micro DevicesAMD.O slipped over concerns that the chip designer's targets for an artificial intelligence (AI) ramp-up may be too ambitious. The worries overshadows the company forecasting an upbeat finish to the year.

2023-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,3 AI Stocks Set for Another Surge Higher,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-ai-stocks-set-for-another-surge-higher,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
AI stocks present irresistible opportunities for forward-looking investors as the digital age progresses rapidly. The resilience and strength displayed by these equities have boosted the broader tech market. AI’s potential to drive innovation, improve customer experiences, and boost productivity makes it a sought-after tool for businesses. 
With the increasing demand for advanced AI products like ChatGPT, the future seems dominated by AI’s influence, providing high-return opportunities for investors in the AI stock market. The potential in AI stocks is simply too compelling to ignore.
Here are three of my AI stock recommendations that I think are set to surge higher.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com
Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) strategic focus on AI and cloud technology has propelled its stock value significantly in 2023. The company’s advancements in data processing with GPUs and the acquisition of Mellanox establish it as a comprehensive AI solution provider, solidifying its position in the AI industry.
Nvidia’s adaptable strategies focused on AI applications and data center growth position the company to leverage the surge in GPU demand. While gaming revenues may have dropped, Nvidia’s emphasis on data centers and significant investment in Recursion demonstrate its commitment to innovative AI ventures. This sets the stage for continued expansion and success in the AI landscape.
Additionally, Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, believes we are in the early stages of accelerated computing and generative AI adoption, with a trillion dollars’ worth of data center infrastructure transitioning to accelerated computing. Surging demand for Nvidia’s products, driven by companies joining the AI race, has prompted the firm to increase its supply. This strong demand is expected to boost Nvidia’s revenue in the future.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares hit all-time highs at $350, then retreated to $330. Despite the decline, I believe MSFT stock is undervalued and should be valued at $350 per share. The price-to-sales ratio supports this view, considering the significant increase in sales projected for this year compared to 2021. This presents an opportunity for investors.
Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, aims to accelerate progress in chemistry and materials science using quantum elements on Microsoft Azure. The company is developing a quantum supercomputer, adding to the excitement around its business model. In Q4 Fiscal 2023, Microsoft’s revenue increased by 8% year-over-year, and net income rose by 20% year-over-year. Microsoft Cloud, contributing 53.9% of the total revenue, can gain further momentum with the growth of quantum computing and its impact on Microsoft Azure’s value proposition.
Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) mainly relies on its ad network, which generated $56.3 billion in Q2 and accounted for 80.8% of its revenue. While advertising’s recovery promises more growth, Google is diversifying into quantum computing, with Quantum AI working on groundbreaking technologies. Google’s quantum computer is 47 times faster than the world’s fastest supercomputer.
Moreover, Alphabet presents a compelling investment opportunity with strong Q2 earnings beating expectations and indicating the potential for rising share prices. With revenues of $74.6 billion and robust income growth of 14.79%, the company is on a positive trajectory, expecting over $300 billion in sales this year. Despite a slowdown in growth rates, the overall position remains strong, particularly relative to 2021 peak prices.

However, stocks opened higher Friday on good earnings news from Amazon (AMZN) and decent employment numbers. As I write this, the index is up 0.60% in early trading to 4,527.90. That’s down 1.2% on the week.
On Fridays, I tend to talk about 2-3 stocks that have exhibited unusual options activity. Using Thursday’s action, three stocks I like were unusually active yesterday. Here are three options to buy or sell to bet on these three companies. 
Have an excellent weekend!
Nvidia
Nvidia (NVDA) is the current market share leader in hardware and software products related to artificial intelligence with 90%. That could be why its stock is up 215% in 2023 and 608% over the past five years, 10x the index’s return over the same period. 
On Thursday, Nvidia had four unusually active options with 28 days to expiration or longer. Three of them were put options. Since I’ve already discussed two calls, I won’t bother with the call. 
Of three puts, we have two with Jan. 19/2024 expiries (169 days) and one with a June 21/2024 expiry, 322 days out. The two expiring in 169 days have vastly divergent strike prices of $385 and $520. If the puts expired today, the latter would be put to you.
Fortunately, there is almost half a year before you’ll have to worry about the matter. In the meantime, the bid price for the $520 strike is $99.35, putting the net price you’d pay at $420.65, compared to $357.70 for the $385 strike. 
Based on a current share price of $445.15, it would have to fall by $60.15, or 13.5%, before it is put to you. As for the $520 strike, it would have to fall by $24.50, or 5.5%, before losing money on your put, compared to a 19.6% fall in price to be in the red on your $385 strike.
The third put expires on June 21/2024. It has a bid price of $24.50 and a $335 strike. Were it put to you in 46 weeks, your net price paid would be $310.50. It’s more than possible for its share price to fall to this level. As recently as October 2022, it traded for $112, 75% lower than its current share price. 
Of the three, I like the $335 strike because it gives you a 5.5% annualized yield, a reasonable return should its share price not fall far enough to be put to you. Of course, if it does fall to this level, you’re getting a much better entry point.  
Why do I like the stock? CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang has always been ahead of the curve regarding Nvidia’s next big bet. The company’s current bet on AI is another example of why he’s not afraid to take risks.
Dick’s Sporting Goods
Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) is the country’s largest sporting goods retailer. Its stock is up nearly 20% year-to-date and 318% over the past five years, 5.4x the S&P 500’s return. 
The stock had two unusually active options on Thursday with 28 days to expiration or longer. Both were calls expiring on Sept. 15. One had a strike price of $155 and a $4.20 ask. The other was a $165 strike with a $1.85 ask. 
With a share price of $145.21, the latter call requires Dick’s share price to rise nearly 15% to be in the money. However, based on a delta of 0.18290, its share price must only increase by $10.11, or 7%, to double your money on the ask. 
The former only has to rise by 9.6% to be in the money. However, to double your money on the call, the shares must increase by $12.34, or 8.5%, 150 basis points higher than the latter. 
So, if you are bullish on the stock, as I am, the $155 strike makes more sense.   
Why do I like the stock? The sporting goods industry historically experiences consistent, if not spectacular, growth. Between now and 2026, the industry’s expected to grow by 7.5% annually to $239 billion worldwide. 
TJX Companies
TJX Companies (TJX) is one of the world’s largest off-price retailers, with over 4,800 stores in nine countries. Its stock is up nearly 9% year-to-date and 71% over the past five years, 20% higher than the S&P 500’s return.
The stock had one unusually active option on Thursday. It was a call, expiring in 169 days on Jan. 19/2024. It has a $92.50 strike and a $2.92 ask. With a share price of $86.02, TJX’s share price will have to rise 11% to be in the money. However, based on a delta of 0.37394, its share price must only increase by $7.81, or 9%, to double your money on the ask. 
So, you only have to pay a premium of 3.4% of its current share price to lock in the opportunity to buy TJX stock 24 weeks from now. It’s a no-brainer.
Why do I like the stock? It’s a well-run company with a high return on equity (62.8%) and returns on assets (13.3%). And you can’t beat its scavenger-hunt business model, where consumers never know what they will find on every visit.

Aug 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street climbed higher on Monday following a choppy week, with investors looking ahead to a highly awaited U.S. inflation report due later in the week that could test the market's sharp recovery this year.
The main stock indexes ended the week lower on Friday with some investors taking profits after months of gains due to worries over economic data, mixed earnings and rising Treasury yields.
U.S. stocks have sharply rallied in 2023, with the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX clocking 17% gains year to date, fueled by optimism around artificial intelligence and hopes of a soft landing for the world's largest economy.
The U.S. consumer price data on Thursday could offer cues to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy path, after an employment report on Friday re-ignited fears that the central bank could keep rates higher for longer.
""This month there is more than usual focus on the economic data coming out as the Fed will have more time to digest and synthesize the data,"" said Peter Andersen, founder of Andersen Capital Management.
""My hypothesis is the Fed's last hike was at its last meeting, that the economic data between now and the next Federal Reserve meeting in September will show consistent success in taming inflation.""
New York Fed President John Williams, a voting member this year, said he expects interest rates could begin to come down in early 2024, as per a report, while Governor Michelle Bowman said additional interest rate hikes will likely be needed in order to lower inflation to the 2% target.
At 09:51 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 241.97 points, or 0.69%, at 35,307.59, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 18.92 points, or 0.42%, at 4,496.95, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 6.62 points, or 0.05%, at 13,915.86.

Yellow CorpYELL.O, a nearly 100-year-old U.S. trucking firm, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sunday, dragging its shares 32.2% lower.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares took many investors by surprise in 2023. Shares have more than tripled year to date and currently carry a 232 P/E ratio. The forward P/E ratio of 59 makes shares look more palatable, but most of the upside potential came and went for investors.
Shares may continue to go higher and reward long-term investors, but the stock’s nearly parabolic growth rate since October 2022 makes it prime for a correction. Even if that correction doesn’t come anytime soon, other AI stocks have more reasonable valuations and can have more gains ahead.
Artificial intelligence is changing the way companies operate and serve customers. This technology will create many winners in the stock market that can reward long-term investors. Add these three AI stocks to your watchlist in the search for the next Nvidia.
Super Micro Computer (SMCI)

Although Nvidia’s year-to-date gains have been impressive, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) shares have done better. SMCI stock more than quadrupled year to date, and the company’s preliminary earnings gave investors additional reasons to hold onto the stock.
The company’s guidance numbers comfortably exceeded prior guidance by wide margins. Fiscal Q4 guidance went from $1.7B-$1.9B to $2.15B-$2.18B. SMCI has experienced record orders with a rapidly growing backlog.
Although the company reported solid preliminary earnings, investors must look at a company’s valuation before buying shares. High growth makes a stock attractive, but it wouldn’t make much sense to buy a stock with a 1,000 P/E ratio.
Luckily, Super Micro Computer has a reasonable valuation, especially for a company with its growth potential. Shares currently trade at a 32 P/E ratio. Super Micro Computer’s AI infrastructure solutions help its clients develop and execute advanced AI and HPC applications. Its servers are critical for artificial intelligence and the metaverse.
Shares trade at a reasonable level, and the company’s growth is accelerating. The stock looks like one of the top picks in AI.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is one of the top semiconductor companies. The firm has many clients, including Nvidia and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has enabled roughly 85% of the worldwide semiconductor startup product prototypes.
Recent quarters of declining revenue and earnings have made the stock more affordable, heading into the AI boom. TSM shares currently trade at a 16 P/E ratio with a dividend yield approaching 2%.
Once revenue and earnings get back on track, shares can soar. The stock is down by more than 30% from its all-time high and faces headwinds. TSM has delivered an 18.6% earnings compounded annual growth rate since 1994. The company has faced more challenging headwinds in the past and has been very rewarding for long-term investors. The rising demand for AI combined with a low valuation makes TSM a worthy AI stock to watch.
Symbotic (SYM)

Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) shares have gained more value than Super Micro Computer shares on a year-to-date basis. The 345% year-to-date gain is a sight to behold. Let’s look at the force driving the momentum.
Symbotic’s AI products and software help clients reimagine the supply chain and oversee the flow of inventory. Walmart is one of many clients that have added Symbotic robots to its warehouses. This allows companies to deliver more goods at a quicker rate while reducing costs. Symbotic’s resources also take up less space in warehouses which provides more room for inventory.
Symbotic reported 77.6% year-over-year revenue growth in Fiscal Q3 as the figure jumped from $176 million to $312 million. The company’s adjusted EBITDA loss shrank from $22 million to only $3 million. Symbotic’s systems sales contract with GreenBox increased the company’s contracted backlog to approximately $23 billion. The company expects to generate $290 million to $310 million in revenue in Fiscal Q4.
High revenue growth and narrowing losses can turn this company into a long-term winner. It can be a good AI stock to keep your eye on.

2023-08-09 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Nvidia, C3.ai, Palantir, and Other AI Stocks Crumbled Today",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-c3.ai-palantir-and-other-ai-stocks-crumbled-today,"What happened
No one disputes that the astonishing market recovery so far this year has been driven by recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI). On the heels of its worst performance in over a decade, the stock market is firmly in rally mode in 2023. Market watchers are undoubtedly anticipating the potential for widespread productivity gains made possible by generative AI.
With that as a backdrop, shares of semiconductor specialist Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) slipped 4%, enterprise AI software provider C3.ai (NYSE: AI) fell 8.3%, and data mining and AI specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) slumped 9.9% as of 3:24 p.m. ET on Wednesday.
While the downgrade for numerous U.S. banks was no doubt a contributing factor in the stock market's gloomy mood today, a pronouncement by a Wall Street analyst about the state of AI stocks helped fuel the pessimism.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
The excitement regarding the prospects of AI has been something of a phenomenon this year, causing stocks in the space to surge. Indeed, each of our trifecta of AI stocks has led the rally, with C3.ai, Nvidia, and Palantir soaring 195%, 194%, and 139%, respectively, (as of this writing) so far this year.
This exuberance has some on Wall Street calling foul and suggesting that while the potential for AI is real, the rally might have gotten ahead of itself.
That's the position taken by Morgan Stanley equity strategist Edward Stanley. He cites the stock surge as evidence of an AI stock bubble, which he believes might be near its peak. He suggests that if Nvidia is a proxy for AI, then we're in the ""later innings,"" and the ongoing market gains could be running out of steam.
To put the situation into historical context, Stanley cites precedent, writing, ""Bubbles tend to rally a median 154% in the 3 years pre-peak."" He qualifies that position by pointing out that while Nvidia stock has nearly tripled so far this year, broader AI benchmarks -- including the MSCI USA IMI Robotics & AI Select Net USD Index -- have climbed more modesty, up roughly 47%.
If the analyst is correct, the broader stock market gains, driven by AI stocks, could come to a screeching halt.
Now what
Not everyone is on board with Morgan Stanley's assessment. Veteran technology analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush says that AI could spark the ""fourth industrial revolution"" and that the current bull market could run for years.
""While many of the tech skeptics will point to today as a '1999 moment' à la on the verge of the dot-com bubble/collapse given the significant move in tech valuations, we strongly disagree,"" Ives said. He goes on to say that the ""massive $800 billion AI opportunity (our estimate) is now on the doorstep for the tech sector for the next decade.""
This brings up an important point. There could be a near-term correction in the stock market; we could also be in the midst of a sea change in technology that could drive stocks higher for the next decade. The two aren't mutually exclusive. Furthermore, if the AI revolution has legs, calling this a ""bubble"" might be technically correct and still be misguided.
Yet, today's sell-off may also be missing the forest for the trees:
Nvidia's state-of-the-art processors are the gold standard for AI, and the company dominates the competition, controlling a 95% share of the machine learning market, according to data compiled by New Street Research. Nvidia is also a leader in providing semiconductors to the data center industry, which will eventually need to upgrade to keep up with the latest advancements in AI.
Palantir has a long track record of providing data mining and AI solutions to government agencies and is in the process of building up its book of business for enterprises. The company recently added its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) and is making progress with onboarding new customers, though that process will take time.
I have long cited C3.ai as an outlier, with its price gains partly driven by its prescient ticker: AI. The company supplies turnkey AI applications to businesses but continues to forecast essentially flat growth -- even in the midst of the AI boom.
Data by YCharts.
I'm a firm believer and shareholder in both Nvidia and Palantir and have no qualms about their futures. I continue to have my doubts about C3.ai and am waiting for financial or operational evidence that proves me wrong.
Furthermore, if the adoption of AI continues over the coming decade, the stocks leading the charge will no doubt ebb and flow; no stock goes up in a straight line for long.
Lastly, each of these stocks sports a lofty valuation, with Nvidia, Palantir, and C3.ai selling for 19 times, 13 times, and 10 times next year's sales, respectively. However, with trillions of dollars in potential economic gains at stake, the companies that seize on the AI opportunity could eventually grow into their valuations, depending on the scope of their revenue increases. But stocks with valuations of this magnitude won't be for everyone.
That said, there's plenty of time for the AI revolution to play out, so long-term investors should stay the course.

2023-08-10 00:00:00+00:00,Here is What to Know Beyond Why NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is a Trending Stock,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/here-is-what-to-know-beyond-why-nvidia-corporation-nvda-is-a-trending-stock-5,"Nvidia (NVDA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -3.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has gained 0.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $2.06 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +303.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.79 points to a change of +133.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.6%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.77 indicates a change of +38.3% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.1%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nvidia.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.02 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +64.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $42.78 billion and $57.19 billion estimates indicate +58.6% and +33.7% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Nvidia reported revenues of $7.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -13.2%. EPS of $1.09 for the same period compares with $1.36 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.51 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.5%. The EPS surprise was +18.48%.
Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

Stock picking is not easy. However, if done right, investors can reap plenty of riches. A well-timed investment can make people millionaires. Consider that $1,000 invested in Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG/NASDAQ:GOOGL) during its August 2004 initial public offering (IPO) would be worth $1.2 million today, and you get an idea of the benefits that come from choosing the right millionaire-maker stocks. Finding stocks that have the potential to make millionaires out of investors is not easy.
Throughout the last 20 years, it has meant investing mostly in cutting edge technology companies. Of course, tech stocks are not without risks. However, the risk can be worth it if a stock pays out a big enough reward to its stockholders. Finding millionaire-maker stocks with high growth potential, plenty of catalysts and a competitive edge is key. Here are three stocks that could make you a millionaire by 2024.
Meta Platforms (META)

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) appears to have its mojo back, and that’s good news for investors. After a bruising 2022, the Facebook and Instagram parent company has seen its share price gain 145% this year as the company pivots away from the metaverse, cuts costs and focuses more on artificial intelligence (AI). After getting knocked lower by high interest rates, META stock looks to be back in full growth mode, which is why it made our list of millionaire-maker stocks.
The social media giant also just reported financial results that have reignited confidence in the company and its shares. META stock jumped 8% after the company’s Q2 print showed earnings per share of $2.98 versus $2.91 that had been expected by analysts. Revenue in the quarter totaled $32 billion compared to consensus estimates of $31.12 billion, driven by a rebound in digital advertising on its social media platforms. Revenue in Q2 increased 11% from a year ago, the first time the company has reported double-digit growth in that area since the end of 2021. It’s time to buy.
Tesla (TSLA)

A lot of people continue to gripe about Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). They complain about the mixed financial results, delayed products such as the overly hyped Cybertruck and say that CEO Elon Musk is too distracted with his other business ventures. However, betting against Tesla has proven to be a losing proposition. Despite all its ups-and-downs, TSLA stock is up more than 900% throughout the past five years. Few other millionaire-maker stocks come close to matching its return. If there’s one stock likely to make you a millionaire, this would be it.
Currently, TSLA stock is in retrenchment mode after the company issued mixed Q2 results. Since mid-July, the company’s share price has pulled back nearly 10%. Investors should view this as a buy-the-dip opportunity. This is especially true since there are many catalysts on the horizon for the stock. These include the launch of the long gestating Cybertruck, as well as plans for Robotaxis and the development of a supercomputer that the company is developing for AI machine learning called “Dojo.”
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: Allmy / Shutterstock.com
The important stat to keep in mind with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is that the company controls 80% of the market for the microchips that power advanced AI applications. That’s huge and puts Nvidia streets ahead of its competitors. Even its main rival in the AI chip race, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), is playing catch-up. With Nvidia pushing full steam ahead on new AI chips that use its advanced technology, the company and its stock should continue powering ahead for many years to come.
Owing to the company’s competitive advantage, NVDA stock has increased nearly 200% year to date, and its share price is up 565% after five years. This spring, the company achieved a $1 trillion market capitalization. While the share price has taken a breather in August along with the broader stock market, investors shouldn’t fret. The company is scheduled to deliver its Q2 print on August 23 and it could prove to be a new catalyst for the stock. The last time Nvidia delivered its financial results, its share price jumped 26% higher.

2023-08-14 00:00:00+00:00,Will Revenue Growth Boost Keysight's (KEYS) Q3 Earnings?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-revenue-growth-boost-keysights-keys-q3-earnings,"Keysight Technologies, Inc. KEYS is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 17, after market close. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 9.28%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.58%, on average.

The company is expected to report higher revenues year over year, backed by healthy demand trends for electronic design and test solutions. Its approach of collaborating with leading organizations to accelerate innovation and strategic buyouts is strengthening its portfolio and is likely to have supported the top line during the quarter.
Factors at Play
In the fiscal third quarter, Keysight collaborated with Nokia Bell Labs to test the propagation characteristics of the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) spectrum that is essential for 6G networks. The analysis is likely to have sowed the seeds of innovative software and hardware offerings for the seamless transition to superfast data speed, ultra-low latency and near-infinite bandwidth of 6G networks. Keysight also expanded its autonomous driving validation test solutions with the launch of the E8717A Lidar Target Simulator. These developments are likely to have contributed to top-line growth in the quarter.

During the quarter, Keysight unveiled a new software solution for RF calibration and verification testing procedures. The newly introduced solution in the company’s PathWave Test Executive for Manufacturing Developer Version now effectively automates and simplifies the intricate testing process, primarily catering to the requirements of automotive manufacturers.

It also partnered with Samsung Foundry to revolutionize the workflow automation process. Through the adoption of Keysight's IC-CAP Model Generator, Samsung Foundry aims to accelerate the creation of circuit libraries, a vital component of process design kits for their advanced radio frequency (RF) semiconductor process technologies.

In the quarter-under-review, KEYS inked an agreement to acquire a controlling stake in the French software company, ESI Group. The transaction is valued at $995.81 million. The strategic buyout will significantly augment Keysight’s software prototyping capabilities and enable it to provide software-centric solutions with advanced virtual prototyping and simulation. The portfolio expansion is likely to strengthen its position in the industry.

In the fiscal third quarter, Keysight introduced PathWave Design 2024. This latest suite of EDA software tools aims to address the challenges faced by design organizations in the semiconductor and electronics industry.

The company also unveiled AresONE-M 800GE, a comprehensive multi-speed Ethernet performance test platform, designed to support network engineers with advanced capabilities. The solution offers the most comprehensive DCI (data center interconnects) speeds, ranging from 10 GE to 800GE, within a single test platform that supports all required forward error correction types with in-depth link tuning, stability, reliability and performance measurement statistics. Such initiatives are likely to have boosted the top line during the quarter.

Our estimate for Electronic Industrial Solutions Group segment is pegged at $432.2 million, indicating 6.5% year-over-year growth. Our estimate for Communications Solutions Group segment is pegged at $946.9 million.

For the July quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1,382 million, up from $1,376 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share stands at $2.04, suggesting an increase from the prior-year quarter’s figure of $2.01.
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Keysight in the fiscal third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.

Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.74%. The Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $2.03 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $2.04. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main stock indexes closed lower on Tuesday after stronger-than-expected retail sales data stoked worries interest rates could stay higher for longer, while U.S. big banks dropped on a report that Fitch could downgrade some lenders.
The Commerce Department report showed retail sales grew 0.7% last month against expectations of a 0.4% rise, suggesting the U.S. economy remains strong.
After the data, traders' bets of a pause on hikes by the Federal Reserve next month stayed intact at 89%, yet analysts said investors were worried rates could stay at current levels longer than anticipated.
""We would probably end up with an inverted yield curve for longer than anticipated, even if we don't end up with an economic recession,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.
""That would end up curtailing lending because even if you were my brother-in-law, I wouldn't want to lend to you at a loss.""
A report said ratings agency Fitch could downgrade multiple banks. Shares of JPMorgan Chase JPM.N, Bank of America BAC.N and Wells Fargo WFC.N fell sharply.
""The story from Fitch about potential downgrades to multiple U.S. banks (is) weighing on sentiment,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.
""You combine that with the retail sales figures this morning that were a little hotter than estimates, (it) furthers the potential higher for longer rates scenario from the Fed.""

NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's minutes showed central bank officials were divided over the need for more interest rate hikes at their last meeting.
The minutes of the Fed's July meeting showed most policymakers continue to prioritize the battle against inflation, throwing in uncertainty for the markets over the outlook for rates.
""I agree with the governors that we're not convinced that inflation is totally in the rear view mirror,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
""I think the markets will be on pins and needles regarding what the Fed will do all through September and into October.”
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 33.62 points, or 0.76%, to end at 4,404.24 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC lost 156.59 points, or 1.15%, to 13,474.45. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 179.86 points, or 0.51%, to 34,766.53.
Bank shares extended losses, with the S&P 500 bank index .SPXBK down and Bank of America BAC.N leading losses among bigger banks.

JNPR revealed that Viettel Group, a prominent telecommunication entity in Vietnam, has opted to deploy Juniper’s MX960 Universal Routing Platform for high-speed connectivity in the Southeast Asian nation. The agreement signifies an extension of Viettel’s decade-long dependence on Juniper routing and security solutions. Vietnam is one of the fast-growing digital economies in the world and has over 77 million Internet users. Viettel boasts a leadership position with a 54% share of the mobile market and a 40% share of the fiber Internet market.

With a booming e-commerce business and rapid adoption of digital services, there is a growing demand for better network connectivity among consumers. Viettel is aiming to leverage Juniper's MX-SPC3 Services Cards and MX960 Universal Routing Platform to match the rising growth in data traffic. MX960 Universal Routing Platform is packed with highly scalable routing, switching, security and service features. It ensures high performance and greater scalability for service providers in mobile and data center networks. This enables network operators to keep pace with the rapidly changing digital landscape.

Successful deployment of the solution will augment Viettel’s carrier-grade network address translation capacity, which will enable it to efficiently expand its consumer mobile and fixed broadband services, and ensure premium connectivity to end users.

It is offering a wide array of products such as the T4000 core router, QFX data center platform, ACX and PTX packet/optical solution, among others.

With the growing usage of smartphones and tablets, mobile data traffic has gone up.

It is witnessing strong momentum across core industry verticals and is confident about its long-term prospects. Investments in customer solutions and sales organizations have enabled the company to capitalize on the solid demand across end markets. Juniper is expected to benefit from the higher spending pattern among carriers to upgrade their networks and support the incremental growth in data traffic.

NVIDIA Declares $0.04 Dividend
On May 24, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share ($0.16 annualized). Shareholders of record as of June 8, 2023 received the payment on June 30, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.04 per share.
At the current share price of $471.16 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.03%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.18%, the lowest has been 0.02%, and the highest has been 0.50%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.13 (n=236).
The current dividend yield is 1.12 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.04. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company has not increased its dividend in the last three years.

2023-08-25 00:00:00+00:00,2 Crypto Stocks to Watch as Bitcoin Stages a Comeback,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-crypto-stocks-to-watch-as-bitcoin-stages-a-comeback,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading within a narrow range in August as volatility this time around is significantly low due to traders going on holiday until Labor Day.
However, the price of Bitcoin lately bounced back from its trough of below $25,500, the lowest level since mid-June, touched last week. It is now holding above the psychological level of $26,000 over the past 24 hours.
So, what’s behind the Bitcoin rally? Traditionally, the price of Bitcoin is dependent on the performance of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 stock index. This is because both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies are considered to be risky assets.
Now, NVIDIA Corporation’s NVDA current blowout earnings have not only lifted the mood among investors to place bets on tech stocks but also given cryptos, including the price of Bitcoin a lift (read more: Nvidia & 2 Other AI Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying Soon).
The long-dated Treasury yield, meanwhile, has fallen. The 10-year Treasury yield, after hitting its highest level in more than 15 years earlier in the week, declined to 4.18% on Aug 24.
Growing concerns about a “hard landing,” or in other words, the Federal Reserve not being able to tame inflation without causing an economic slump, has put pressure on bond yield. After all, the Fed’s move to curtail inflation has impacted both the manufacturing and services side of the economy adversely. This, in turn, is spurring bets that the central bank will be compelled to remain accommodative.
The possibility of a pause in interest rate hikes in the upcoming meetings bodes well for high-risk assets, including digital coins. The CME FedWatch Tool lately shows that around 80.5% of market participants do not anticipate the Fed to raise interest rates in September.
Furthermore, interest among financial bigwigs in crypto is likely to push the price of Bitcoin, along with other digital coins, higher shortly. BlackRock, Inc. BLK has appealed to regulators to create a spot Bitcoin ETF, which will increase retail participation. Similarly, The Charles Schwab Corporation SCHW is backing a new exchange called EDX Markets.
The price of Bitcoin is also dependent on its halving cycles. Bitcoin’s halving event is due next year when the supply of the world’s numero uno cryptocurrency will be lowered leading to a boost in its price. Thus, astute investors should now keep a tab on companies that can make money by capitalizing on Bitcoin’s current upsurge, and growth prospects.
Primary among them is the Bitcoin mining firm HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. HIVE. HIVE Blockchain’s shares have soared 138.9% so far this year, while the broader S&P 500 Index has gained 16.9% in the same period.
HIVE Blockchain’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 72.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HIVE’s current-year earnings has increased 39.4% over the past 60 days. HIVE Blockchain has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.
Block, Inc. SQ, by the way, has invested significantly in Bitcoin. Per CoinGecko, Block has around $235 million in Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Its Cash App, where users can easily purchase and sell Bitcoin, has seen strong engagement in recent times.
Block has made rampant investments in blockchain technologies that empower the presence of cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin. Block’s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year are 68% and 36.3%, respectively. In reality, Block’s projected earnings growth rate over the next five-year period is 30%. Block has a Zacks Rank #3.

  Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2023-08-28 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia's forward PE ratio tumbles to lowest in eight months,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidias-forward-pe-ratio-tumbles-to-lowest-in-eight-months,"By Noel Randewich
Aug 28 (Reuters) - Increased analysts' estimates since Nvidia's NVDA.Ostrong quarterly report last week have left the world's most valuable chipmaker trading at its lowest forward earnings multiple in eight months.
Nvidia's stock added nearly 2% to $468 on Monday, leaving it down almost 1% since last Wednesday, when the Santa Clara, California company far exceeded expectations with its quarterly revenue forecast as an artificial-intelligence boom fueled demand for its chips.
At that price, Nvidia shares are trading at the equivalent of around 33 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, according to Refinitiv data. That forward PE compares to over 46 a week ago, and it is now at its lowest since December 2022.
Nvidia's stock has more than tripled this year amid soaring demand for its top-of-the-line processors used to power generative AI technologies that can read and write in human-like ways.
Benchmark Research analyst Cody Acree has a ""buy"" rating on Nvidia but pointed to the company's reliance on Taiwanese chip foundry TSMC 2330.TW, which also serves Apple AAPL.O and other big customers, as a factor that could keep Nvidia from selling as many of its high-end chips as it would like.
""It's not just demand, but what they can actually deliver,"" Acree said.
In its report last week, Nvidia, with a stock market value of $1.14 trillion, also said it would buy back $25 billion of its shares, suggesting chief executive Jensen Huang views them as undervalued, even after gaining 220% year to date.
Following its report, analysts on average expect Nvidia's revenue for the fiscal year ending in January 2024 to reach $53 billion, nearly double the previous year, according to Refinitiv data. The company's net income is seen quintupling to over $22 billion in the same fiscal year before reaching $35 billion the following year.

With that being said, there are a few attractive tech stocks set to report earnings on Thursday, August 31. Here are two of these top-rated tech stocks that investors may want to consider.
Broadcom AVGO: Nvidia’s stock is certainly compelling after its strong Q2 results last Wednesday and Broadcom is another semiconductor giant to watch.
Broadcom currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) ahead of its fiscal third-quarter report on Thursday. As a global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices, Broadcom is in the AI conversation with its Jericho3-AI chip which has the ability to wire supercomputers together.
Likely to receive a boost from AI capabilities, Broadcom’s Q3 earnings are expected to rise 7% YoY to $10.42 per share. On the top line, Q3 sales are forecasted to be up 4% to $8.86 billion. With steady annual top and bottom-line growth in the cards as well, Broadcom stock has soared +59% this year to easily top the S&P 500’s +16% and the Nasdaq’s +33%.

Momo MOMO: Also sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Chinese internet and software company Momo is attractive ahead of its Q2 results on Thursday. 
Formerly known as Momo, Hello Group provides a mobile social and entertainment platform primarily used in China. Trading around $9 a share much of the risk to reward still appears to be priced into Momo stock which is up a respectable +7% YTD and has now skyrocketed +98% over the last year.  
To that point, Momo’s earnings are expected to be up 15% from the prior year quarter at $0.38 a share compared to $0.33 per share in Q2 2022. This is despite Q2 sales projected to be down -9% to $423.77 million. Plus, annual EPS estimates have trended higher which supports the case that Momo stock is cheap at just 5.5X forward earnings.

Other Stocks to Watch
Investors will also want to pay attention to Dell Technologies' DELL Q2 report on Thursday with its stock landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Dell is partnered with Nvidia on their joint artificial intelligence venture Project Helix.
With Nvidia crushing its Q2 top and bottom line expectations last week, there is much optimism that Dell could do the same as the technology solutions provider looks to expand services for generative AI.
Zacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock
It's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.
With strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.

Aug 30 (Reuters) - Specialized cloud provider CoreWeave is exploring a minority stake sale that values the company at as much as over $8 billion, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
CoreWeave did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The Roseland, New Jersey-based company is working with an adviser as it looks for buyers for a roughly 10% equity stake at a valuation of between $5 billion and $8 billion, the people told Bloomberg News requesting anonymity, adding the terms have not been finalized yet.

2023-08-31 00:00:00+00:00,"Dell beats quarterly revenue estimates on AI strength, demand recovery",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dell-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-on-ai-strength-demand-recovery-0,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - Dell Technologies DELL.N beat quarterly revenue expectations on Thursday, as it benefited from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and stabilizing demand for computer hardware and server products after a months-long slump.
Dell is also seeing a better demand environment, Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said.
The company, which earlier this year slashed more than 6,000 jobs, is expected to see a demand boost for its PowerEdge servers and generative AI designs with Nvidia NVDA.O from rising investments in artificial intelligence by Big Tech companies.
""AI is already showing it's a long-term tailwind, with continued demand growth across our portfolio,"" Clarke said.
Servers and networking revenue for the second quarter came in at $4.27 billion, up 11% from the first quarter, driven by higher demand for AI-optimized servers, Dell said.
The personal computer maker reported revenue of $22.93 billion for the quarter ended Aug. 4, compared with estimates of $20.85 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Revenue at the company's client solutions group - home to its consumer and enterprise PC business - rose 8% from the first quarter to $12.94 billion.

2023-09-01 00:00:00+00:00,Surging Stocks That Can Keep Taking Market Share,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/surging-stocks-that-can-keep-taking-market-share,"Taking market share is crucial for companies and their stocks as a large market cap has numerous advantages.
Large-cap companies can secure cheaper financing and have a consistent stream of revenue while capitalizing on the recognition of their brand. This allows a company to operate on a greater scale which can increase profitability in correlation with economies of scale.
Typically for stocks, large-cap companies are valued at $10 billion or higher and tend to have the greatest trading liquidity. Higher trading liquidity allows large-cap stocks to be traded on the stock market quickly, without having a significant effect on their price.
Furthermore, market cap allows investors to compare the size, growth potential, income, and risk of different companies.
Let’s take a look at a few surging stocks that may be able to keep taking market share and boost investors' portfolios.
Technology Leaders with a Large Market Share
With this year’s surge in tech stocks, there are a number of companies that are retaining or growing their hefty valuations.
It's hard to not have this conversation without mentioning Apple AAPL or Nvidia NVDA with a market cap of roughly $3 trillion and $1.2 trillion respectively.
Apple is the highest-valued company on U.S. stock exchanges with Nvidia the fifth largest and continuing to take market share among chipmakers. Nvidia’s market cap is now 122% above the Zacks Semiconductor-General Markets' $54.82 billion average which alludes to why NVDA shares have kept climbing over the years.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Nvidia currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has soared +223% this year. More astonishing, NVDA shares are now up 12,000% over the last decade and this somewhat unending stellar performance could continue with Nvidia’s chips powering the AI revolution.
As for Apple, its stock has climbed +43% this year and currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Of course, Apple can only fall out of the top spot in terms of market cap but the company’s $48 billion cash pile is indicative of the benefits of taking market share. Furthermore, with a pipeline of famous tech products Apple stock is up +963% in the last 10 years and is usually a viable option for longer-term investors.

A Retail Company Poised to Take Market-Cap
Looking at smaller companies that may be on their way to taking market share or eventually achieving large-cap status is always beneficial. This could correlate with lofty stock market gains and Urban Outfitters URBN stands out in this regard.
With a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Urban Outfitters is a popular fashion retailer that caters its apparel and merchandise to younger generations. Urban Outfitters has shown signs of taking market cap in the past hitting a peak of $6.25 billion back in 2018.
While Urban Outfitters' market cap is currently at $3 billion, we can see from the chart below that this is now on par with its Zacks industry further suggesting the company is a sound investment in the space and may have a chance at being a disrupter (and has already been so).

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Plus, Urban Outfitters' steady growth is reason to believe it might be taking real market share along the way. Urban Outfitters' stock has climbed +39% YTD as earnings are forecasted to pop 82% in its current fiscal 2024 to $3.18 a share compared to $1.75 per share a year ago.
More importantly to seeing continued brand growth, sales are expected to be up 6% in FY24 and rise another 4% in FY25 to $5.30 billion. Better still, FY25 sales projections would represent 55% growth over the last five years with FY21 sales at $3.45 billion.

Bottom Line
Taking market share puts companies in a position to offer shareholders unprecedented returns in regard to their stocks. This makes keeping an eye on a stock's market cap beneficial to investors as well. To that point, Apple, Nvidia, and Urban Outfitters are three stocks to watch.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2023-09-05 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks to Avoid This Week,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-avoid-this-week-94,"Wall Street moved nicely higher last week. I thought my three stocks to avoid for that week -- Altria , Affirm , and Tilly's -- were going to lose to the market. They rose 1%, 23%, and 5%, respectively; an average gain of 9.7% for the week.
The S&P 500 moved 2.5% higher. So I was wrong. But I've still been right in 61 of the past 97 weeks, or 63% of the time.
Let's turn our attention to the current week. I see Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Affirm (NASDAQ: AFRM), and American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE: AEO) as stocks you might want to consider steering clear of this week. Let's go over my near-term concerns with all three investments.
1. Nvidia
The bigger they are, the harder they fall. Nvidia has been one of this year's biggest winners. The stock is up 232% so far in 2023, more than tripling despite serving up some relatively ho-hum results. Revenue rose just 10% over the past 12 months, and that follows flat top-line growth in the last fiscal year.
There's naturally a lot more to Nvidia than its trailing growth. Nvidia is the leading player when it comes to graphics processing units (GPUs), but it has also emerged as a market fave for investors hoping to cash in on the artificial intelligence revolution. The future is stronger than the past, and that includes its latest quarter as revenue more than doubled and earnings per share soared more than fivefold.
Image source: Getty Images.
Analysts see Nvidia's revenue surging 103% this fiscal year with earnings per share more than tripling. Bears argue that Nvidia's valuation is outrageous, but that's the view from the rearview mirror. Nvidia is trading for just 45 times this fiscal year's projected earnings and 29 times next year's multiple.
If this still seems like a bullish pitch for Nvidia, let's go back to the first part. Nvidia is the largest stock to more than triple this year. Its $1.2 billion market cap shadows the second-largest stock to triple with its $80 billion market cap. It has become the top AI investing play, and after back-to-back weeks of healthy gains the market is susceptible to a pullback. The stock's one-year beta of 1.62 translates into Nvidia being more volatile than the overall market. If the market slips in this holiday-abridged trading week, it's fair to say that Nvidia could take a bigger hit than the general market.
2. Affirm
Affirm has done something that you don't see very often. The stock soared 23% two weeks ago. It popped another 23% last week. A better-than-expected financial report helped fuel the stock's initial jump. Some upbeat analyst notes and short covering helped keep the rally going last week.
This is as good a time as any for a breather. It had a strong ""beat and raise"" report two weeks ago, but challenges remain for the ""buy-now, pay-later"" (BNPL) industry. Rates remain stubbornly high, and there are real risks to the Affirm model in the current climate. Analysts don't see Affirm turning an annual profit until at least 2027, so it's not as if time is on its side.
3. American Eagle Outfitters
American Eagle Outfitters hit a fresh 52-week high on Friday. Why? The specialty apparel retailer reports quarterly results on Wednesday, and four weeks ago it offered a rosy financial update. But shoppers aren't necessarily flocking back to American Eagle. The chain's early August update called for flat revenue growth for the fiscal second quarter that it will discuss this week. The good news is that it was initially targeting its top line to decline in the low-single digits.
American Eagle also expects its operating profit to exceed the $25 million to $35 million that it was previously forecasting. This is obviously an encouraging update, but check the chart. American Eagle rose 3% the day it announced that it would go on to top its earlier guidance, a reasonable bounce. It has gone on to pop another 17% in the four subsequent weeks. The stock has discounted a blowout performance. Is flat revenue growth worth this kind of helium? Some retailers are seeing weakness as customers prioritize low-margin essentials as purchases. American Eagle will have a lot to prove this week.
The stock market is always on the move. If you're looking for safe stocks, you aren't likely to find them in Altria, Affirm, and American Eagle Outfitters this week.

The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) today is down -0.83%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) is down -0.52%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is down -1.03%.
Stock indexes this morning are moderately lower, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrials, and Nasdaq 100 indexes falling to one-week lows.  Stocks opened lower this morning on negative carryover from a fall in the Euro Stoxx 50 to a 1-1/2 week low on weaker-than-expected Eurozone economic news. Losses in stocks accelerated as bond yields jumped after today’s Aug ISM services report expanded more than expected, bolstering speculation the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer.
The U.S. Aug ISM services index unexpectedly rose +1.8 to a 6-month high of 54.5, stronger than expectations of a decline to 52.5.
The U.S. Jul trade deficit widened to -$65.0 billion from -$63.7 billion in June, a smaller deficit than expectations of -$68.0 billion.
Boston Fed President Collins said it's ""too early"" to say if inflation is on a sustained path to 2%, and further tightening may be warranted depending on the data.  She added that the Fed will ""need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time"" as while demand is moderating, it continues to outpace supply, adding to price pressures.
The markets are discounting the odds at 8% for a +25 bp rate hike at the September 20 FOMC meeting and 54% for that +25 bp rate hike at the November 1 FOMC meeting. 
Global bond yields are higher.  The 10-year T-note yield rose to a 2-week high of 4.296% and is up +2.6 bp at 4.286%.  The 10-year German bund yield rose to a 2-week high of 2.654% and is up +4.1 bp at 2.653%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield rose to a 2-week high of 4.559% and is up +1.1 bp at 4.536%. 
Overseas stock markets are mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.74%.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed up +0.12%.  Japan’s Nikkei Stock Index closed up +0.62%.

Across the markets…
December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ23) today are down -7 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is up +2.6 bp at 4.286%.  Dec T-note prices today gave up an early advance and fell to a 1-1/2 week low, and the 10-year T-note yield rose to a 2-week high of 4.296% on stronger-than-expected U.S. economic news after the Aug ISM services index unexpectedly expanded by the most in 6 months.  Also, comments today from Boston Fed President Collins weighed on T-note prices when she said it is ""too early"" to say if inflation is on a sustained path to 2% and further tightening may be warranted depending on the data.
The dollar index (DXY00) today is up +0.06% and posted a 5-1/2 month high. The dollar recovered from overnight losses and moved higher as T-note yields climbed on the stronger-than-expected Aug ISM services report.  Also, hawkish comments from Boston Fed President Collins supported the dollar. In addition, Chinese economic concerns weighed on the yuan, which fell to a 10-month low against the dollar today. 
EUR/USD (^EURUSD) is down by -0.06% and dropped to a 2-3/4 month low.  The euro gave up overnight gains and turned lower after the dollar rebounded from early losses and moved higher.  Also, weakness in Eurozone economic news weighed on the euro after Eurozone July retail sales fell for the first time in four months and after German Jul factory orders fell by the most in 3-1/4 years.  EUR/USD today initially moved higher on hawkish ECB comments after ECB Governing Council member said the markets are underplaying the risks of an ECB rate hike next week, and Governing Council member Kazimir said a September rate hike is preferable to a later increase. 
Eurozone July retail sales fell -0.2% m/m, right on expectations and the first decline in four months.
German July factory orders fell -11.7% m/m, weaker than expectations of -4.3% m/m and the biggest decline in 3-1/4 years.
ECB Governing Council member Kazimir said the ECB needs to raise interest rates one more time to make sure inflation returns to 2%, and a September rate hike is ""preferable"" to a later increase. 
ECB Governing Council member Knot said investors betting against an ECB rate hike next week are ""maybe"" underestimating the likelihood of it happening.
USD/JPY (^USDJPY) is down -0.10%.  The yen today recovered from a 10-month low against the dollar and is slightly higher.  Comments from Japan’s top currency official, Masato Kanda, sparked short covering in the yen when he said he wouldn’t rule out any options if forex moves continue. The yen gave up some of its gains after T-note yields rose. 
October gold (GCV3) today is down -8.8 (-0.45%), and Dec silver (SIZ23) is down -0.433 (-1.81%).  Precious metals prices this morning are moderately lower, with gold dropping to a 1-week low and silver falling to a 2-week low.  Today's rally in the dollar index to a 5-1/2 month high is bearish for metals.  Also, rising global bond yields are negative for precious metals prices.  In addition, hawkish central bank comments undercut precious metals when Boston Fed President Collins said it is ""too early"" to say if inflation is on a sustained path to 2% and further tightening may be warranted, and ECB Governing Council member Kazimir said the ECB needs to raise interest rates one more time to make sure inflation returns to 2%.

2023-09-07 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Self-Driving Car Stocks That Aren't Tesla,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-self-driving-car-stocks-that-arent-tesla,"While self-driving cars might have seemed like high-concept sci-fi a decade ago, we now have robotaxis from different companies running on our roads. Even though none of them have achieved full autonomy – also known as L4 – the technology has made great strides over the years.
Tesla’s (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk believes his company’s mammoth valuation - which is currently a tad short of $800 billion, and peaked at $1.2 trillion in 2021 - is linked to its autonomous driving segment. But the autonomous driving ecosystem is quite wide, and includes chipmakers who supply high-end chips that enable autonomous driving, lidar makers, automakers who are working on autonomous driving, ride-hailing companies looking to add robotaxis to their fleets, and pure-play self-driving companies.
I believe that Xpeng Motors (XPEV), General Motors (GM), and Nvidia (NVDA) are three solid autonomous driving stocks from across this spectrum for investors to play the growing traction and technological advancements in self-driving.
Xpeng Motors Has Significant Self-Driving Operations
XPeng Motors is a China-based electric vehicle (EV) maker that also has burgeoning autonomous driving technology in the country - even as Tesla does not have permission to do so in Chinese cities, apparently over spying concerns.
The company's autonomous operations have been in the news over the last month. Wu Xinzhou, its vice president of autonomous driving, stepped down in early August, which led to a brief sell-off in the stock – underscoring the segment’s importance for Xpeng Motors.
However, late last month, Xpeng Motors acquired the self-driving operations of Didi – the largest ride-hailing company in China – in exchange for a stake in the company in a deal valued at $744 million. XPEV's deal with global auto giant Volkswagen (VWAGY) is also a testimony to its prowess in autonomous driving
Xpeng Motors offers its autonomous driving service in several Chinese cities, including Beijing, and is looking to expand to 50 Chinese cities by the end of the year. Simultaneously, the automaker is aiming to cut the segment's bill of materials by 50% by 2024 - which would help to improve its gross margins after that metric went negative in Q2.
www.barchart.com
XPEV: The Top Stock for Self-Driving in China
During their Q2 2023 earnings call, XPEV’s CEO He Xiaopeng said, “Over the second half of this year, we plan to make additional major breakthroughs in experience and coverage with our XNGP ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) to further drive customer acceptance and the adoption process, widening the technology gap with our peers.”
Autonomous driving is a focus area for the Chinese government, and Xpeng Motors is among the best ways to play the theme. With a market cap of around $16.5 billion and next-12 months (NTM) price-to-sales multiple of 2.46x, XPEV looks reasonably valued, and markets don’t seem to be fully appreciating its self-driving business - which can add significant long-term value.
General Motors is Another Underappreciated Autonomous Driving Company
While rival Ford (F) gave up on its L4 ambitions and wrote off its $2.7 billion investment in autonomous driving startup Argo AI, General Motors continues to invest in its Cruise self-driving business, of which it holds the majority stake.
Cruise has had its share of controversies - like many other autonomous technologies, including Tesla’s full-self driving - and last month, GM slashed its robotaxi fleet in San Francisco by half after two collisions. That said, GM is working on commercializing the service after years of investment. 
Responding to an analyst question on whether General Motors would also consider licensing the Ultra Cruise driving system to others, CEO Mary Barra said during the Q2 earnings call that she sees the product as both “revenue-generating and profit-generating” – while keeping more details for the company’s investor day event in the fall.
I believe that along with strong automotive operations and the EV pivot, GM's autonomous driving business will also drive long-term value for investors, even as the asset is currently being underappreciated by the markets.
While Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has been gradually selling GM shares, I believe with a single-digit forward price-to-earnings ratio and significant autonomous driving operations, GM stock looks like a good buy at these prices.

Nvidia: Another Autonomous Driving Play
Chips are the cornerstone of most modern gadgets and technologies, and Nvidia is one name that has chips to offer for applications ranging from artificial intelligence (AI) to the metaverse to, yes, autonomous driving. The company also has a dedicated Automotive segment that sells chips to automakers, including those based in China. 
Nvidia stock has more than tripled this year because of soaring sales of its AI chips. The sales of its Automotive segment, incidentally, fell 15% in fiscal Q2 2024, which was attributed to lower demand from China. While Nvidia’s Automotive business is pacing at an annual revenue run rate of just above $1 billion, the company believes that it could be a $300 billion market opportunity as autonomous driving gains traction.
www.barchart.com
Currently, Wall Street is bullish on Nvidia’s AI foray and Rosenblatt expects the stock to more than double to $1,100 over the next year. 
However, over the long term, the Automotive segment could be a key driver for Nvidia - which makes it an attractive autonomous driving stock.

Growth stocks tend to be riskier than blue-chip stocks, but investors can reap some of the highest returns with these assets. While growth stocks often get hit hard by market corrections, these are the types of stocks that can double or triple within a few years.
Cathie Woods’ growth-centric funds demonstrate how quickly growth stocks can soar and how quickly they can crash. Her funds were among the top performers during the pandemic, but those funds came crashing down in 2022. Those same funds have experienced a resurgence this year due to growth stocks becoming favorable again.
You don’t have to invest in high-revenue, high-losses companies to get the growth investor experience. There are plenty of growth stocks with good fundamentals and promising prospects. These are three of the best growth stocks to consider buying.
Arista Networks (ANET)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is a cloud networking company that has more than 8,000 customers and a 19% market share in data centers. Shares trade at a reasonable 36 P/E ratio and have gained over 60% year-to-date. The cloud networking company has rewarded long-term investors with a 192% gain throughout the past five years.
Arista Networks got its start by working with financial companies that wanted to enable high-frequency trading for their customers. This start helped the company expand into data centers and early-stage companies. The firm has worked with many large customers, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), VMware (NYSE:VMW) and Dell (NYSE:DELL).
The company has dozens of products, including Cloud Vision and AI Spine. Cloud Vision helps with workflow automation, while AI Spine enables top-tier AI interconnection which is essential for real-time gaming, virtual reality and metaverse applications.
Arista Networks also has a cybersecurity component through its Zero Trust Networking service and recently introduced Cognitive Unified Edge, a product for small businesses.
Arista Networks reported 38.7% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter. GAAP net income jumped from $299.1 million in Q2 2022 to $491.9 million in the most recent second quarter. That marks a 64.5% year-over-year gain which makes the stock’s P/E ratio look more justified.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom. Shares have more than tripled year-to-date and are up by over 600% throughout the past five years.
I have expressed skepticism about Nvidia’s valuation in the past, but the most recent earnings report has made the valuation easier to justify. The stock’s P/E ratio is roughly 120 which is still high, but a few weeks ago, the stock had a 250 P/E ratio.
Nvidia doubled its Q2 revenue year-over-year and experienced 843% year-over-year net income growth. That latter metric explains why the stock can become more affordable in the future. Shares only trade at a 47 forward P/E ratio which is justifiable given the company’s incredible growth rate.
No investor should expect Nvidia to hold onto these growth rates forever. The company reported $13.5 billion in revenue and $6.2 billion in net income. It’s impossible for net income to grow another 843% year-over-year because net income would have to surpass revenue.
Eventually, the growth will slow down because it is unsustainable. Investors should consider how long Nvidia can hold onto these growth rates. If Nvidia continues on this trajectory for another year before retaining moderate growth rates (i.e., respectable double-digit revenue growth), the valuation can be a bargain for investors who buy at the current price.
Celsius Holdings (CELH)

Most growth stocks are tech companies that tap into innovative concepts. However, some companies buck the trend and give shareholders enticing opportunities. Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) investors know first-hand that the best growth stocks aren’t always in the tech sector.
The stock has almost doubled year-to-date but is up by an astounding 4,295% throughout the past five years. The energy drink producer reported a 112% year-over-year revenue jump in the second quarter. The company also reported $41 million in net income attributable to common shareholders which represents a 345% year-over-year gain.
Celsius Holdings doesn’t have the most attractive valuation, but growth rates and new partnerships make the stock look compelling over the long run. A recent partnership with Pepsi (NYSE:PEP) can give Celsius Holdings more exposure to international markets.
Celsius Holdings has a $15 billion market cap. As the company continues to grow its market share on the back of stupendous revenue and earnings growth, that market cap can become much larger.

2023-09-11 00:00:00+00:00,Will U.S.-China Tech Squabbles Threaten Tech Stocks?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-u.s.-china-tech-squabbles-threaten-tech-stocks,"Several mega-cap technology stocks and suppliers to Apple (AAPL) tumbled last week after the Chinese government banned iPhones from government-backed agencies and state companies, thereby threatening iPhone sales.  Also, suppliers to Huawei Technologies came under pressure last week, with some U.S. lawmakers calling for a halt to all U.S. exports to the company.
Apple lost more than -5% last week on news that the Chinese government plans to expand a ban on using iPhones in sensitive departments to government-backed agencies and state companies. The action by China threatens to erode Apple’s position in China, a market where Apple receives about 20% of its yearly revenue.  However, most analysts believe China is unlikely to completely ban iPhones as the country still benefits greatly from Apple’s presence.
Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM), the world’s biggest supplier of smartphone chips, slumped more than -7% last week on the China news.  A widening ban in China on iPhones undercut the stock since Qualcomm is one of the iPhone's biggest vendors.  Also, news that U.S. lawmakers are scrutinizing suppliers to Huawei Technologies weighed on Qualcomm as it provides Huawei with older generation 4G chips.  However, Qualcomm received a boost today after Apple extended its contract with the company to provide it with modem semiconductor chips for three more years. 
Other global chipmakers are also under pressure due to the ongoing U.S.-China tech squabbles.  SK Hynix, a key supplier to both Apple and Nvidia (NVDA), dropped more than -6% last week on the revelation that some of its products were found inside Huawei Technologies’ Mate 60 Pro smartphone.  Billionfold Asset Management said the slump in SK Hynix reflects “the fear of potential U.S. sanctions” against the company after some of its chips were found in the Huawei smartphone.  SK Hynix gets about a third of its revenue from China.
Despite U.S. policy efforts aimed at ending reliance on the strategic semiconductor industry from foreign companies, the U.S. still gets the bulk of its chips from foreign suppliers. Even after increased import and export curbs, China still accounted for 17% of total chip imports to the U.S. in 2022, down from 25% from 2018, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  The majority of mega-cap chip stocks in the U.S. have registered an average increase of almost 50% in the weight of China among their suppliers over the past four years.  China’s export restrictions are a key risk to the U.S. semiconductor industry, even more than U.S. export curbs because major U.S. chip manufacturers have higher exposure to China on the supply side.

2023-09-13 00:00:00+00:00,Viasat (VSAT) SSD Solution Attains Successful Validation,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/viasat-vsat-ssd-solution-attains-successful-validation,"Viasat, Inc. VSAT recently revealed that its next-generation encryption solution DARC-ssd (solid state drive) 600 has been successfully validated by the U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre. Notably, the DARC-ssd solution is the only hardware-encrypted solid-state drive to obtain this recognition. It is available in three variants, 256GB, 512GB and 1 terabyte (TB).

It leverages Viasat's integrated military-level 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard hardware. This creates complete hardware encryption of both data and the operating system. By mandating strong authentication and encryption within the hardware container itself, this method reduces the likelihood of data manipulation.

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, data breaches are becoming increasingly prevalent. The methods of attacks and data tampering are also becoming more sophisticated. Data breaches can have significant and far-reaching impacts on government agencies and armed forces. This can impact national and financial security and also jeopardize public confidence in the government.

Viasat’s DARC-ssd 600 effectively addresses these concerns. Its Data-at-Rest technology protects sensitive information by securing government devices that may be at risk due to theft, loss, or cyberattacks. The SSD also integrates industry-standard NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) interface and common form factor M.2 2280. This enables customers to upgrade older hardware systems and incorporate the latest tactical military devices with advanced encryption. This ensures high security with enhanced flexibility.

Additionally, the SSD solution also accelerates data loading times while ensuring energy efficiency. These advanced features of DARC ssd 600 are capable of offering high-quality security of commercial and military assets of the U.K. armed forces.

Viasat has a long-trusted business relationship with the U.K. government and its partners. The company has decades of track record as a leading provider of hardware encrypted solutions. The successful testing is likely to solidify the acceptance of Viasat’s cutting edge technology and boost further commercial expansion.

The company is ramping up investments in the development of its revolutionary ViaSat-3 broadband communications platform, which will have nearly ten times the bandwidth capacity of ViaSat-2. ViaSat-3 class of Ka-band satellites are expected to provide enhanced bandwidth with greater flexibility to move and concentrate that capacity virtually anywhere there is demand.

The ViaSat-3 constellation is intended to provide high-speed and high-capacity connectivity to expand coverage and help bridge the digital divide in areas with limited Internet access. Viasat’s blue-chip customer base, which comprises the U.S. Department of Defense, civil agencies, allied foreign governments, satellite network integrators, as well as large communications service providers and enterprises, adds to its strength.

Furthermore, the growing adoption of inflight Wi-Fi services in commercial aircraft is proving conducive to business growth. Viasat’s impressive bandwidth productivity sets it apart from conventional and lower-yield satellite providers that run on incumbent business models. It has a competitive advantage in bandwidth economics, global coverage, flexibility and bandwidth allocation, which makes it believe that mobile broadband will act as a profit churner with a significant improvement in in-flight connectivity revenues.

The stock has lost 39.9% over the past year compared with the industry's fall of 13.6%.

This video was recorded on Sep. 09, 2023
Asit Sharma: Their idea is that when you've got this nice return that's well above your cost of capital, you actually attract competition and there is this finite time in which that edge dissipates and you're driven to eventual returns that almost equal your cost of capital.
Ricky Mulvey: I'm Ricky Mulvey, and that's Motley Fool Senior Analyst Asit Sharma. On today's show, Asit takes the expectations investing framework to four companies. We go from General Motors all the way to Nvidia. In between, we've also got a uniquely positioned railroad company and a fast-growing payment processor that's recently taken a hit. Asit gave us an introduction to expectations investing on Thursday's show, so I'd recommend starting there if you haven't, but this show will still make sense if you have not had a chance to listen to Thursday's episode yet. Let's get into the case studies and I think a good place to start is General Motors. Asit, if I told you a story about an electric car maker that now has fully self-driving cars on the road. They are licensed to give rides in multiple cities across the United States. You might guess that its stock price would be better than flat over the past five years. Investors have basically received nothing in terms of price appreciation and basically, a 1% dividend for you to wait. What do you think is the story that the market is telling about General Motors right now? It seems very disconnected to me.
Asit Sharma: I think the market is making some assumptions about General Motors cash flows that could be reasonable. Again, we'll take this from an expectations investing framework or point of view. I think the market is saying that this company has some pretty big incremental investments to make. Those are going to decrease the potential of its cash flows to grow. Let's say if revenue takes off, that revenue might be challenged by not as much operating margin as it potentially appears today on the books, and I think that the market may also be saying that the potential for revenue itself to grow from this technology may be overstated. If I didn't know anything else, I would say perhaps there are some other worthy competitors in the space. Just talk through three of the big drivers of value that Mobison discusses with Alfred Rappaport in the book Expectations Investing. This is probably what the market is saying. Now you and I know a little bit more about General Motors so we can see where that fresh take could be off. What are your thoughts, Ricky?
Ricky Mulvey: I think you have to ask a very basic question if you're a General Motors investor right now. This is something Mobison has encouraged, which is what is your basic unit of analysis? It could be cars sold. Maybe it's self-driving car miles given to riders. Is this going to be maybe a legacy automaker with the growth component of full self-driving automobiles attached or is that a race to zero and you're really investing in a very mature car maker? I think it's an interesting question because they've been first in San Francisco. General Motors is allowed to offer 24 hours of self-driving car service. There's been controversy around it. There's been a social media post where a self-driving car rode basically into a construction site and into wet cement, which is an image that is attractive and you can understand why that's gone viral. But I think the challenge for investors is what is your basic unit of analysis? If it's in the case of self-driving cars, it looks like it's performing very well right now. But in the case of cars sold, I think you may have a challenge, which is that Mary Barra, the CEO in the lastearnings callsaid, for our future guidance, we are assuming that there will be no strike. I think you would have to ask a serious question of is that reasonable? Could this really put a dent in the cars sold over the next months or probably year? This might cause one of those supply chain disruptions for General Motors right now. In my opinion, at the time of this recording, it's likely that there will be some United Auto Workers strike for the major car makers.
Asit Sharma: The exercise you went through just now is similar for both a traditional discounted cash flow model and expectations investing if you spreadsheet out that more. Because both are trying to get at something really fundamental. What are the inputs to build value in the form of those future cash flows that have this return above the cost of capital? Now, there's a slight difference I feel between the expectations investor and the DCF modeler. The DCF modeler is going to do his or her best job to figure out those units of value and then start building the model from the ground up. The expectations investor is going to play around more with the determinant of value. Maybe brainstorm a bit more to see if there's something that others are missing. Is there a value driver here? Whether it's going to be sales acceleration or it's going to be better margins or less investment than people expect in the future, less fixed capital investment and determine when that might hit the books and that's the edge. What you mentioned about Mary Barra and the outlook that she and the management team are forecasting, I think is going to be captured by both types of investors. I think they're both going to incorporate whatever their uncertainty is over that. She certainly is talking straight through those possibilities, maybe ignoring them, brushing them off, but I think both types of investors will be hedging their models for this probability. But in general, what you are doing, thinking through Ricky, how do we really understand what's going to push the value here, is the fun part of expectations investing. You did it very well.
Ricky Mulvey: Thank you, I appreciate that. Two other things to note is that General Motors has had a very difficult time achieving a positive free cash flow which you would expect for a mature company. They've done it, I think, in one quarter since 2015. However, there is a very general upward trend to getting back to that place. Barra has implemented stealing from Zuckerberg, perhaps the year of efficiency, identifying two billion dollars in cost savings and then another billion in cost savings. She has called many of these fixed costs which are in some cases, early retirement offers to employees. In other cases, I would say costs that we have a dispute about whether or not they are fixed, which includes corporate travel and marketing expenses, but that's two in the weeds to get into for now. I think it'll be a very interesting company to watch moving forward. If I may Asit, let's move on to our next company.
Asit Sharma: Proceed.
Ricky Mulvey: The next one which has a little bit of higher expectations from the market is a railroad company. It's called Canadian Pacific. They just made an acquisition that will give them a rail network from Mexico to Canada. The only one that exists like that. There were a lot of questions about the acquisition, whether they would go through and some regulatory pressure, perhaps from the United States government. That didn't happen, and the acquisition was completed. But the stock didn't really react to that. I found that curious because this seems to be a huge win for the company. But what do you think the market is saying about this merger?
Asit Sharma: I think the market is still very positive on the merger. There was some compression on the stock price while this merger was under review by the various transportation safety boards, mostly in the US. It got approved at a time when the market wasn't in a great shape. We suddenly had so much macro pressure. It's almost got lost in the noise. But I will point out that Canadian Pacific, Kansas City has actually outperformed its peers over a year to date, a one-year, a three-year, a five-year period. But much of this out-performance is over the last year or so where the stock just hasn't deflated as much as its peers, as the macro economy has gone bad. I think the investor enthusiasm is actually there, it's not as visible. Maybe if we were still in a low interest rate environment, you would see more of a pop there. But I think the market does look favorably on this merger. We can get into those details if you'd like.
Ricky Mulvey: I would, because this company, Canadian Pacific, Kansas City, is significantly more expensive than its other railroad piers. Which forgive me, I'm going to use the price to earnings multiple, those trade at about a 16-20 PE multiple, and Kansas City is up in the 27 range. Do you think this higher multiple is justified?
Asit Sharma: I believe it is. There are a couple of things going on in that multiple. One is, of course, the efficiencies, the synergies that the company is talking up that it's going to realize over time. We're not more than a few months into the formal approved merger of these two companies. Investors are looking forward to that, and there are a number of pricing advantages that it has, being this now single company that can provide you with near shoring capability. It provides a route for automotive parts. All the way from the factories in Mexico, which received from their own ports, all the way up through the US supply chain then into Canada where we have a retail presence of a Ford Motor Company. You can see how valuable that is. The pricing power doesn't really come from competing with other railroads because they don't have those North South routes. It comes from offering a potentially cheaper transitive good versus trucking. If you're going to ship something via truck all the way from Mexico to, let's say Detroit, you've got some inbuilt pricing power there.
You're not competing against other rails, you're competing against freight on the road. But you're making a higher margin than you might otherwise. If you are say, transiting Saskatchewan potash, which it does up in Canada going east to west. That's one part of it. The second is the combined companies have a little bit higher operating ratio than they should. Operating ratio is the ratio that railroads use to judge themselves on efficiency. Lower is better. There's some opportunity here to get more efficient. Anyone who follows railroads knows that precision scheduled railroading has been a big force in the industry. Reduce costs by putting locomotives into retirement, cutting down on labor, making it more flexible, speeding up trains, so many different parts of this. You could use one of these multiple point plans in this newly combined entity and bring those margins to a better place. It's almost like investors are saying in advance, we see the opportunity for improvement here in the operating ratio. It's going to be rolling at some point, so we'll pay more today for these shares, as koki as it sounds.
Ricky Mulvey: This is a company with a revenue growth rate of about 30%, so 37% a return on invested capital of about 7%. It'll be interesting to see how that changes as the merger unfolds. For investors that are watching this company, what would you recommend being the basic unit of analysis?
Asit Sharma: This one is interesting because the railroad industry already provides you with different looks into very minute types of measurement. I think looking at volumes, looking at train speeds is always fun, seeing how those increase, looking at network fluidity. There is so many stats that railroads provide you that would be so great. We saw the equivalent stuff out of software companies. I think pick your unit, it could be say revenue as an expression of volume is always fun. There are ton mile metrics that you can use. Pretty much what I'm saying here, you can get as minute as you want Ricky, and build your model from there. But I think some expression of the relationship between the revenue per something, whether that be a car load, whether that's expressed as a mile or one of its different categories of freight, intermodal, we mentioned looking at whatever type of category you feel is most important. It could be chemicals, it could be potash. Choose that and start working up. It could be different for an expectation based investor. If you're building that DCF model in a traditional way, you'll arrive at a basic unit and only stick with that and see if the economy improves, how much more volume will this company have? Then you spread it up into your model. The expectations based investor is really going to key in on what could push the value. I'm going to look more at that intermodal volume than anything else because that's where I think the edge for this business will come in two years.
Ricky Mulvey: You don't want to try to guess what grain production will be in five years. I understand. Let's move on to a higher growth company that's taken a big hit recently and that company is Adyen. It's a digital payment processor, and its stock fell about 40% upon its latest earnings release. This is a company that does payment processing for very large companies. It's not like Paypal or Stripe where you see that at the point of transaction, they're taking care of the entire payment process for companies like Meta and Uber.
Ricky Mulvey: With that understanding, how did the Adyen story change in its latest report?
Asit Sharma: Ricky, Adyen has been investing in its people for the last 18 months or so, and they have told investors that's going to be part of our margin story. Margins are going to decrease temporarily, then they're going to come back up once we have everyone on board. They only report twice a year. They're not based in the US. I believe in the Netherlands is their home headquarters, and so twice a year we get this look. This quarter revenues, although they're growing fast, 23% I believe, year-over-year, still demonstrably slower than in the past and the company talked about some rising competition in North America, an important new market to them in the digital payment space. The story changed a bit. Investors are a little antsy now because they're worried about that growth cadence. They also see that the company is in investment mode, so they don't like that the profits are slimmer because they're loading up on really great skilled people as all other tech companies seem to be laying off these highly skilled workers. The narrative has shifted and you've got another half year to wait now before we can see some of the first results of this investment. But I do want to say Adyen has pulled this off before. It's been through these cycles of hiring waves where then they come out with some innovation in their product suite.
Ricky Mulvey: They did exactly what they said they're going to do. I see both sides of this debate. On the bare side, you could see folks saying, hey, what are you doing hiring so many people, that's lowering your earnings and growth and it's already slowing down. Versus the other side, hey, we're making long-term investments and we need to get more people to grow this business even if it hurts margins in the short term. Where do you think you fall on that side of the debate?
Asit Sharma: I see both sides of it too Ricky, I think I lean on the side of those who say that the investments have a payoff. How Adyen is different. You can say Adyen, let's agree to disagree on the pronunciation. You can look at this company as one that's a little different from the stripes and PayPals of the world because it's more focused on providing this unified platform. They have something they called Unified Commerce, which takes all your purchasing data across channels, whether it's digital or point of sale. Someone coming into a physical store, not using a point of sale that they could even purchase on their mobile. But all the different ways that retailers and other companies pull in their payments, they seek to give the merchant this really insightful analysis, visual graphs, insights that they can use when they pull all of this data together. They have a different bent, I think, than other companies and part of it stems from what you said, that they are first and foremost a platform company. They like to go after big platforms and BV, sole provider of the payments processing. They had this strategic way of looking at things and the argument that management makes is, look, our solutions are actually cheaper than anyone else's when you look at a total return on investment proposition in terms of the insights that the platform gives plus the total cost. Not really hyper-focusing on a fee structure. If you hyperfocus on a fee structure, then there are some competitors that look cheaper than Adyen at first sight, but they potentially aren't in that total yearly stream of payments and all the associated activities going over the payments platform. I tend to agree with those who say that the investment is necessary. This is a company that's really cash flow rich, the great free cash flow generator and I'm willing to be patient and spot them a little bit of slack here.
Ricky Mulvey: You can always correct my pronunciation on things. It is Adyen, and I was calling it Adyen, perhaps that is a consequence of growing up in southern Ohio, I'm going to blame that. But when I think of the Adyen story, it seems like this is the fate for many, if not all, high growth companies which is that there's always going to be a bit of a return to the mean. I don't know.
Asit Sharma: Yeah, you hit on something that Michael Robinson and Alfred Rappaport talk about in expectations investing. Their idea is that when you've got this nice return that well above your cost of capital. You actually attract competition and there is this finite time in which that edge dissipates and you're driven to eventual returns that almost equal your cost of capital, then you're very mature company. They believe that naturally, this has to be the eventual outcome, so what characterizes outperformers from middling companies is that they can just keep their edge for longer than the next company. The most innovative companies on the planet can sustain that success for a long time. But eventually, I think everything does revert to the mean. At least that's what this sort of classical approach to valuation posits. I think it's true unless of course, you're Coca-Cola.
Ricky Mulvey: Adyen has about a revenue growth rate now in the '20s, that's down from 40. Their return on invested capital, I believe is in the '20s. For how expectations investors should judge this company, where the growth could come from, do you think it's customers acquired, is it the payment volume they're transacting? What are some of the signals for this company?
Asit Sharma: I think the biggest signal is going to be the value driver of operating margin. We talked about in our intro session three drivers that main drivers, not all but main drivers that Mobison and Rapport identify. It's your operating margin, your sales growth, and your incremental capital investment. For this company, management has been forecasting to investors that we're going way back up to an adjusted margin that's some 20 percentage points above where it is today. I believe that they'll get there and I think that the market now is pricing in. Those who are doing their DCFs are pricing in something lower than the margins that management is saying Adyen can well achieve and that will be their stable state operating margin. If you're an expectations-based investor, your job would be to say, OK, how does that work? What's the lever here? If prices in North America and the digital payment space are getting a little commoditized because there's competition and they've got some big platforms, how else are they going to drive that margin?
Asit Sharma: The answer would be in the innovation that is promised by the hire of so many talented people. It's like expansion of the product suite, it's introduction of new products. It's going to be very innovation based and that's a hard task with this company for those who aren't willing to spend a lot of time on it. Because then you have to get your sleeves rolled up and learn more about where they're investing, and if that has a payoff in your eyes. This isn't always the easiest of models to use. The expectations based model. I think Adyen is one of the harder companies actually to try it on.
Ricky Mulvey: Fair enough. Let us move to the complete opposite side of the planet that General Motors is on, that is Nvidia. They make GPUs, design chips, operate data centers, and the stock price over the past 12 months is up about 250 percent. For those who may not know, why have growth expectations changed so much for this company?
Asit Sharma: Growth expectations have changed for Nvidia because of a breakthrough in the way that neural networks processed information that came in the years between 2013 and 2017. Some really smart people at Google put out a paper called Attention is All You Need. That showed that something called the transformer model was really great at processing language. Much better than the way it had done before, which is all linear. This model assigned weights to language and made its own decisions on what's important in interpreting sentences and making predictions on what the next word in a sequence of words would be. Now, everything we know about ChatGPT, large language models, Generative AI, all of this good stuff really stems back to that development and it turns out that the best way to utilize computational power for this transformer model and for training large language models happens to be the GPU's that Nvidia develops in conjunction with its libraries that accelerate its hardware and software. This want to punch by Nvidia is yet to be equaled by any other company that manufactures either GPUs or very focused chips, ASIX chips and they've got an edge, which means that everyone who wants to use these models, especially the large Cloud hyperscalers who will offer space in their clouds for us to try to use them, need to buy Nvidia's chips. Lastly, Nvidia has been investing in the architecture on these chips for years and years and years, foreseeing the day that this would happen, and so they were able to meet this tremendous demand pretty well over the last year. We can break down more of that if you'd like or move on to your question. Next question regarding Nvidia.
Ricky Mulvey: I have a big question about Nvidia that I want to ask as we start to wrap up, which you described the edge that they have. For me, perhaps to my detriment, I've put Nvidia in the two hard bucket. Is it able to defend itself long term from other companies that make graphics processors, like AMD or other data center companies? Amazon Web Services offers data and it seems like they might have some smart folks working there. The revenue growth rate is over 100 percent. The return on invested capital is 30 percent. But should investors expect to see that Compress it's other companies? Notice what Nvidia is doing.
Asit Sharma: I think they're going to have some competition at the margins. Undoubtedly, there's so many worthy competitors who want a piece of this very lucrative market. The edge that they have is really tied in with their technology called Kuta, which basically is tied into the acceleration of its GPUs. As I was mentioning forward, there's no other company that has a complete solution that offers the GPUs or ASIX chips, and also acceleration libraries to the extent that Nvidia does. Many of them industry specific that are also primed to work with data centers that are now being optimized by Nvidia's own software for data centers, its own networking equipment for data centers, and its own standards that compete with Ethernet. It's become what Jensen, Huang, CEO of Nvidia, often talks about, a full-stack company and that's what's going to be really hard to crack. While they'll see competitors chipping away and eroding some of that lead at the margins, for a while, they're going to enjoy a lot of demand. Now, what we have to understand about Nvidia though, it is a cyclical company. At some point, this demand will level off. People will wake up one day and say, what kind of return am I getting on all these chips I bought? Maybe I'm not going to buy so many next year, and it's cyclical in that sense. We've seen this story play out before. The important thing to remember though is that they work on their architectures in advance of the use cases. It's not like Jensen Huang dreamed up an explosion in gaming, an explosion in Crypto, an explosion in generative AI. He knew that stuff like this would come along and he designed or had his engineers design the architecture to be able to be ready when those novel use cases emerged. I think they'll continue to do that. Now, will the stock race ahead of itself at some points in time? Yeah.
Ricky Mulvey: Is there anything else you want to say or maybe some takeaways for an investor who wants to start applying the expectations investing frameworks to their personal decision-making?
Asit Sharma:Yeah, sure. We'll stick on Nvidia to wrap up in terms of how you might use this. There was a time, just a few months ago when many investors were focused on the fact that Nvidia was trading at 37 times sales. That was very backward-looking. If you had the time to roll up your sleeves and I agree Nvidia is one of those companies that its easily put in the two hard pile. I've spent a lot of time studying and still feel like I'm scratching the surface on a lot of things. But let's just suppose you had the time to understand if the demand that was being whispered about was real and you studied generative AI, and you studied the needs of the big hyperscalers in other companies. You could arrive at your own assessment that the market's looking backward. It's not looking forward at a company that's actually going to have an explosion in its operating margin and an explosion in its sales potentially.
I actually can see a case where this company could be worth more than all those who are plugging in the inputs in their DCF models. Because I understand the value drivers, it's going to be operating margin for this company. It's going to be sales. It's going to be how much they can reinvest in their capacity. The relationships with TSMC to get the product in the door and you could have bought shares. This is a classic case of that. Now, it's a really complex company to give that bird's eye view on, but you could apply this thinking to other companies. That's my message here. It doesn't have to be in Nvidia. It could be a much simpler company to understand, and that's what I like about it. This is geared toward folks like you and me, Ricky, who want to be a little more lazy, who want to be a more big picture, who are interested in innovation, who want to find an edge and place our best thoughts behind it and buy some shares of a company. We don't want to get lost in our DCF models and be paralyzed by indecision. Because we don't understand if our assumptions are right or not. I highly recommend this book. It's something that the entire investing team at the Motley Fool was given by our management, Expectations Investing once more by Michael Mobison and Alfred Rappaport and I highly recommend anyone who wants to just even conceptually use this. You don't even have to use a spreadsheet.

2023-09-18 00:00:00+00:00,3 Pricey Chip Stocks That Are Worth Every Penny,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-pricey-chip-stocks-that-are-worth-every-penny,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
While Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates headlines in the semiconductor space, many view this sector as a one-horse race. Of course, that’s not the case. Companies like Nvidia and its mega-cap semiconductor peers are certainly among the most-watched stocks in the market right now.
The question for many investors is whether the valuations of these pricey chip stocks make sense. Indeed, Nvidia has proven that its larger-than-life valuation over the past decade has been warranted. However, these stocks are among the most difficult to value, even for the experts. For retail investors, these companies may be considered too much work to try to digest.
At the right price, any stock can be a buy, assuming it’s got a future. These three chip makers certainly do. Let’s dive into the reasons these stocks may be worth every penny.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com
Nvidia remains a top pick for investors seeking growth in today’s AI-focused world. In Q2, the company reported impressive earnings of $2.70 per share, beating expectations and showcasing strong revenue growth.
Nvidia’s Q2 earnings impressed bearish investors, with revenue surging 101% year over year (YOY) and net income skyrocketing by 843% YOY. Although it has a price-earnings ratio of 110-times, some argue that Nvidia is undervalued, especially with its forward price-earnings ratio at 44. Maintaining strong growth will be key to sustaining its undervalued status. Q3 guidance suggests this trend is continuing.
NVDA stock is poised for growth, backed by enthusiastic buyers and an uptrend above key moving averages. It boasts a $1.13 trillion market cap, rebounding from a pullback. Analysts give it a strong buy with a $1,100 yearly target. NVDA stock rose from $109 to $456 by August 31, 2023, with potential for $500. However, dropping below $470 may push it under $450. Technical analysis indicates bullish sentiment, with an RSI around 60.
Advanced Micro Devices
Source: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock jumped over 2% on September 13, 2023, following a decline linked to unsettling news from China. Despite concerns about August’s high inflation, the semiconductor sector, including AMD, showed resilience. The stock is rebounding about 4% since September 11, 2023.
AMD’s recent acquisition of Mipsology bolsters its AI capabilities with top-tier inference and optimization tools. Furthermore, the company is collaborating with Hitachi Astemo to enhance automotive safety. The use of AI-driven object detection using AMD’s system-on-a-chip, enables both stereo and monocular image processing for self-driving vehicle cameras.
For those bullish on the growth these sectors can provide, and AMD’s position as a “number two” in the chip race, this is a stock to consider for the long-term.
Asml Holdings (ASML)

ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) stands out as the sole supplier of semiconductor manufacturing machines, boasting over 25% anticipated growth this year. The company also offers essential service packages, ensuring steady revenue and a strong case for buying their stock in diverse economic conditions.
ASML stock rose 20.55% year to date (YTD) to $663.56 with a $695.72 target by 19 analysts. The lithographic semiconductor industry aims for $35.21 billion by 2028 (8.56% CAGR). The company’s Q2 earnings showed 27.1% YOY revenue growth to $6.9 billion and 11.7% YOY net income growth to $1.92 billion. The print also boasts 18.54% YOY operating income growth to $2.33 billion, with a price-earnings ratio under 33-times.
The company develops essential tech for making efficient chips used in healthcare, climate solutions, and sustainable energy. This aligns with the European Commission’s goals for innovation and addressing societal issues. ASML is actively involved in a European partnership to advance semiconductor tech.

Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) is like the digital guardian of the Internet. The firm stands guard over websites and applications, defending them from online threats. These cyber threats are constantly trying to disrupt your online experience.
The company’s recent financial results are proof of their success. In Q2 2023, they posted solid revenue of $308.5 million. This is an increase of 32% compared to the previous year. Although they recorded a loss from operations under standard accounting rules, it is crucial to note that they generated non-GAAP income from operations of $20.3 million. This figure underscores their strategic focus on growth.
Why is Cloudflare a promising metaverse value? First, it is a pioneer in Internet security. As the digital world expands, the importance of strong security measures grows exponentially. In addition, their steady revenue growth, as evidenced by their recent results, underscores their financial stability and potential for expansion.
They have recently introduced the “Cloudflare One Data Protection Suite.” This comprehensive security solution safeguards data in diverse environments, such as the Web, SaaS and private applications. It is a direct response to the evolving challenges of protecting sensitive data and intellectual property in today’s technology landscape.
Phishing is a major threat that Cloudflare is addressing. Its 2023 Phishing Threats Report highlights the persistent danger of phishing attacks on the Internet. Phishing is a rapidly growing form of cybercrime that affects organizations of all sizes. This report underscores the need for robust security solutions like the ones they offer to effectively combat this pervasive threat.
NVIDIA (NVDA)

NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been at the forefront of the artificial intelligence revolution for more than a decade, demonstrating its unwavering dedication to AI technology.
Their journey in the field of AI began in 2006 with the introduction of the CUDA programming language. This language quickly gained popularity among AI developers and laid the foundation for a brilliant business strategy. Originally designed for gaming, NVIDIA’s graphics processors found a new home in data centers, meeting the advanced computing needs of operators.
NVIDIA’s financial results are impressive. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, it posted record revenue of $13.51 billion. This is a staggering 88% increase compared to the previous quarter and a remarkable 101% increase compared to the same period last year.
In particular, its data center revenue reached a record $10.32 billion in the same quarter, a staggering 141% increase over the previous quarter and an extraordinary 171% growth compared to the same quarter last year.
Their commitment to AI leadership is underscored by the announcement of the Grace Hopper superchip.

The Superchip, known as GH200, will enter production in the second quarter of 2024.
Its dominance in the AI accelerator market has propelled its valuation above $1 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable chipmaker. The introduction of the GH200 processor is a bold statement by NVIDIA to maintain its leadership and stay ahead of competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC)
Adobe (ADBE)

Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a renowned software company that is making waves in the growing metaverse trend.
Adobe is synonymous with creativity and is worth considering for your portfolio, especially in the metaverse era. In their most recent quarter, the company announced adjusted earnings of $4.09 per share, beating analysts’ average forecast of $3.98 per share. This positive result indicates that they are beating expectations.
Revenue for the same period increased by 10.3% to $4.89 billion compared to the previous year. Analysts had expected slightly lower revenues of $4.87 billion.
It is worth mentioning that Adobe’s reported earnings per share for the quarter were $3.05, lower than adjusted earnings. While this variance may be due to a variety of accounting factors, it is a detail that investors should keep in mind.
Over the past three months, the average analyst estimate for Adobe’s earnings has increased by approximately 1.3%. This uptick indicates growing confidence in Adobe’s future earnings potential.
Adobe’s stock performance says it all, with a 13.2% increase in share price this quarter and an impressive 64.5% year-to-date gain. This suggests that investors are bullish on them, likely due to their strong financial results and growth prospects.
On Wall Street, the 12-month average price target for Adobe stands at $580.00. Investors should monitor Adobe due to its strong results and role in the metaverse.

2023-09-21 00:00:00+00:00,3 Chip Stocks to Watch in the ‘Green Zone’,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-chip-stocks-to-watch-in-the-green-zone,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
With the rising adoption of generative artificial intelligence technology, there’s now an AI gold rush, and semiconductor companies are selling the “picks and shovels.” Hence, all eyes are on the top chip stocks to watch, but are these names also in the “Green Zone?”
TradeSmith offers investors valuable tools for determining which stocks to watch. A good example is its Health Indicator feature. This comprehensive indicator provides an overall rating of a stock’s current health.
Using this metric, you can quickly find potential opportunities to explore. Broken down into three “zones” (green, yellow, and red), you’ll have a general idea about whether it’s best to be bullish, bearish, or neutral on a particular stock.
As you may have guessed, stocks in the “Green Zone” are performing well, with little indication that the trend is on the verge of shifting.
A stock in the “Yellow Zone” has corrected by more than 50% of its volatility quotient (or VQ), a proprietary TradeSmith metric that helps measure a stock’s risk. When a stock in your portfolio goes from green to yellow, it may be a good time to reassess whether to maintain the position.
Stocks entering the “Red Zone” have corrected by more than their calculated volatility quotient. VQ can be useful when adding stop losses to positions. View any move into the Red Zone as a warning sign to exit your position for now.
These three chip stocks to watch are currently in the “Green Zone.”
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Shares in chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have been in the “Green Zone” for more than four months. Some may believe that the stock rallied prematurely due to the AI megatrend, given that the company was not exactly a first mover in the area of AI chips.
However, while it has taken some time for a strong AI growth catalyst to develop for AMD stock, one may be just around the corner. Advanced Micro Devices plans to launch its MI300 AI accelerator chip by year’s end. As Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers recently argued, this chip launch means “increasing confidence” when it comes to the company’s operating performance during 2024.
With this in mind, instead of waning, AI mania surrounding Advanced Micro Devices could perhaps get even stronger over the next 12 months. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for AMD is 40.32%, which makes it a high-risk stock.
Intel (INTC)

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has only recently become a “Green Zone” stock, entering just over two weeks ago. Admittedly, this major chip maker has received far less of a boost from rising excitement about generative AI. This makes sense. Other factors, like the uncertainty surrounding Intel’s turnaround efforts, are outweighing this industry tailwind.
Even so, you may not want to underestimate Intel’s potential to capitalize on the surging demand for AI chips. According to Melius Research’s Ben Reitzes, with INTC stock, possible upside from the company’s Gaudi AI chip hasn’t been priced in. That said, it may take some time for investors to finally appreciate this aspect of the overall story with Intel.
However, once near-term worries still weighing on shares clear up, Intel’s AI catalyst could finally take center stage. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for INTC is 28.03%, making it a medium-risk stock.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in the “Green Zone,” having entered it over six months ago. Shares in this leading AI chip company have nearly tripled in price, largely because it’s one of the few companies so far to successfully monetize this technology.
Yet with the stock pulling back in recent weeks, you may be concerned that fading AI mania means more declines ahead for NVDA stock. Then again, maybe not. Although shares may be vulnerable to some more moderate weakness in the near term, this growth catalyst could once again propel NVDA to higher prices.
How? While having an impact now, AI is poised to have an even greater boost for the bottom line over the next few years, according to sell-side forecasts. This growth acceleration means Nvidia will likely stay one of the chip stocks to watch. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for NVDA is 45.51%, making it a high-risk stock.
The TradeSmith Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
TradeSmith’s mission is to put easy-to-use, technology-based tools into the hands of individual, self-directed investors. TradeSmith began as a simple way to track portfolios using trailing stops and has evolved to become a powerful suite of risk-management and portfolio analysis tools.

2023-09-22 00:00:00+00:00,Why Is Nvidia (NVDA) Down 13% Since Last Earnings Report?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-is-nvidia-nvda-down-13-since-last-earnings-report,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Nvidia (NVDA). Shares have lost about 13% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Nvidia due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.
NVIDIA Q2 Earnings & Revenues Beat Estimates
NVIDIA reported better-than-anticipated results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. For the second quarter, NVIDIA reported non-GAAP earnings of $2.70 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 29.2%. Moreover, the reported figure soared a whopping 429% year over year while increasing 148% sequentially. The robust increase in earnings was mainly due to higher revenues, an improved gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.

Second-quarter revenues more than doubled on a year-over-year basis and climbed 88% sequentially to $13.51 billion. The robust growth in the top line was mainly driven by record sales in the Data Center end market, while its Gaming and Professional Visualization platforms continued to emerge from channel inventory corrections. The top line beat the consensus mark of $11.17 billion.
Segment Details
NVIDIA reports revenues under two segments — Graphics and Compute & Networking.
Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and personal computers, the GeForce NOW game-streaming service and related infrastructure. The segment also offers solutions for gaming platforms, Quadro GPUs for enterprise design, GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.
Graphics accounted for 23% of fiscal second-quarter revenues. The segment’s top line soared 11% year over year while increasing 14% sequentially to $3.11 billion. Our second-quarter revenue estimate for Graphics segment was pegged at $4.24 billion.
Compute & Networking represented 77% of fiscal second-quarter revenues. The segment comprises Data Center platforms and systems for artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, the DRIVE development platform for autonomous vehicles and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.
Compute & Networking revenues soared 166% year over year and 133% sequentially to $10.4 billion. Our second-quarter revenue estimate for this segment was pegged at $6.72 billion.
Market Platform’s Top Line Details
Based on the market platform, Gaming revenues increased 22% year over year while growing 11% sequentially to $2.94 billion and accounted for 18.4% of the total revenues. The year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter growth was primarily driven by increased sales of its 40 series GeForce RTX GPUs (graphics processing units) for laptops and desktops. The company believes that demand has returned to growth after last year’s slowdown. Our estimate for Gaming end-market’s second-quarter revenue was pegged at $2.26 billion.
Revenues from Data Center (76.4% of revenues) jumped 171% year over year and 141% from the previous quarter to $10.32 billion. This year-over-year and sequential rise was mainly driven by the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. The strong demand for its chips from large cloud service and consumer internet companies aided the segment’s top-line growth. Our estimate for this end-market’s second-quarter revenue was pegged at $8.02 billion.
Professional Visualization revenues (2.8% of revenues) decreased 24% year over year but increased 28% sequentially to $379 million. The increased demand for laptop workstation GPUs led to the segment’s sequential revenue growth. Our estimate for Professional Visualization end-market’s second-quarter revenue was pegged at $298.6 million.
Automotive sales (1.9% of revenues) in the reported quarter totaled $253 million, up 15% on a year-over-year basis but down 15% sequentially. The year-over-year rise was mainly driven by the ramp-up of self-driving platforms based on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin SoC by several new energy vehicle makers. Meanwhile, the sequential decline was due to lower overall automotive demand, particularly in China. Our estimate for this end-market’s second-quarter revenue was pegged at $308.2 million.
OEM and Other revenues (0.5% of revenues) plunged 53% year over year and 14% sequentially to $66 million. Our second-quarter revenue estimate for this end-market was pegged at $77.7 million.
Operating Details
NVIDIA’s non-GAAP gross margin increased to 71.2% from 45.9% in the year-ago quarter and 66.8% from the previous quarter, mainly driven by higher Data Center sales.
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 5% year over year as well as sequentially to $1.84 billion. The increase was due to higher compensations and related benefits. However, as a percentage of total revenue, non-GAAP operating expenses declined to 13.6% from 26.1% in the year-ago quarter and 24.3% in the previous quarter.
The non-GAAP operating income jumped 487% year over year and 155% sequentially to $7.78 billion, primarily driven by higher revenues, along with an improved gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
As of Jul 30, 2023, NVDA’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $16.02 billion, up from $13.30 billion as of Apr 30, 2023. As of Jul 30, 2023, the total long-term debt was $8.46 billion, down from $9.70 billion at the end of the first quarter.
NVIDIA generated $6.35 billion in operating cash flow, up from the year-ago quarter’s $1.27 billion and the previous quarter’s $2.91 billion.
The free cash flow was an inflow of $6.05 billion compared with the year-ago quarter’s $824 million and the previous quarter’s outflow of $2.64 billion.
In the second quarter, the company returned $99 million to shareholders through dividend payouts and repurchased stocks worth $3.07 billion. During the first half of fiscal 2024, the company paid out $199 million in dividends and bought back stocks worth $3.07 billion.
At the end of the quarter, it had a remaining share-repurchase authorization of approximately $3.95 billion through December 2023. Additionally, the company’s board approved a new share repurchase authorization worth $25 billion, which has no expiration time.
NVIDIA announced a quarterly cash dividend of 4 cents per share, payable on Sep 28, 2023, to shareholders of record on Sep 7, 2023.
Guidance
For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, NVIDIA anticipates revenues of $16 billion (+/-2%).
The GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are projected at 71.5% and 72.5%, respectively (+/-50 bps). GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated at $2.95 billion and $2 billion, respectively.
GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, are anticipated at approximately $100 million.
The GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter is estimated at 14.5% (+/- 1%).
During the first-quarter earnings results, the company had estimated to make capital expenditures between $1.10 billion and $1.30 billion during fiscal 2024, including principal payments on property and equipment.
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?
In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.
The consensus estimate has shifted 48.31% due to these changes.
VGM Scores
Currently, Nvidia has a great Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.
Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.
Outlook
Estimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Nvidia has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2023-09-26 00:00:00+00:00,Top Buy the Dip Prospects Near 52-Week Highs,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-buy-the-dip-prospects-near-52-week-highs,"Stocks have continued to lose steam with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq dipping over -1% today and now down -4% and -6% for the month respectively.
Corrections can be healthy as the broader indexes are still up nicely for the year and investors may get an opportunity to buy the dip in several intriguing stocks near their 52-week highs.
Three stocks that fit the bill as prime buy-the-dip candidates in this regard are Walmart WMT, Dell Technologies DELL, and New Relic NEWR.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Consumer Shopping Trend Favors Walmart
Inflation has continued to lower the threshold of consumer shopping and may push shoppers to Walmart instead of its rival Target TGT which offers higher-quality goods.
Unlike Target’s stock which hovers near 52-week lows, Walmart is near its highs at around $162 a share with WMT up +15% for the year. Walmart's stronger sales growth has been reassuring to investors with many retailers dealing with other headwinds such as shrink.
Walmart’s e-commerce presence has also continued to expand through its online delivery and in-store pickup. While Target's online sales dropped -10% during Q2, Walmart’s jumped 24% with the company still deriving much of its sales from groceries and not having to rely on other non-essential products like many of its omnichannel competitors.

Dell's Technology Solutions are in the AI Mix
Many tech stocks have dwindled lower in September including Dell Technologies' artificial intelligence partner Nvidia NVDA.
However, DELL is only -4% from its 52-week highs at around $69 a share. Investors look eager to buy the dip for Dell’s enticing generative AI proponents that have been embedded in many of its hardware products (workstations) and technology solutions.
With Dell’s stock up +74% for the year it may still be a more affordable option for AI exposure than Nvidia. The trend of rising earnings estimate revisions is very compelling as well which is indicative of more short-term upside especially as broader markets stabilize.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
New Relic Keeps Expanding 
The road to profitability and expansion for software analytics company New Relic has gained steam as its offerings are also being harvested by AI.
Founded in 2008 and public since 2014, New Relic is expecting expansive double-digit percentage growth on its top and bottom lines with NEWR soaring +52% YTD and on the cusp of its 52-week highs of $86 a share back in May.
Those late to the party may certainly be waiting for a pullback as New Relic’s AI for IT operations (AIOps) is expected to catapult the company among the Internet-Software realm.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Bottom Line
With the broader indexes starting to curtail as of late these stocks look like prime buy-the-dip candidates as they continue to flirt with the possibility of higher highs. More importantly, Walmart, Dell Technologies, and New Relic stock look like viable investments for 2023 and beyond.

2023-09-27 00:00:00+00:00,Cambium (CMBM) Solution Boosts Defense Communication Capability,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cambium-cmbm-solution-boosts-defense-communication-capability,"Cambium Networks Corporation CMBM recently introduced the PTP 700 Beam Steering outdoor unit to enhance defense communication infrastructure. The solution’s smart antenna function supports rapid antenna alignment and quick tactical installation in adverse environments.

It eliminates the manual alignment procedure and requirement of electromechanical positioners. This also resolves the logistical issue by reducing the cost and weight, immensely improving operational efficiency. The integrated smart antenna also plays a vital role in enhancing the signal quality and minimizing interference.
The Dynamic Spectrum Optimization feature allows spectrum managers and network operators to adapt to the changing program landscape while ensuring reliable connectivity and cost optimization. Cambium’s efforts to develop next-generation communication system will strengthen its portfolio and improve commercial prospects in the defense sector.

2023-09-28 00:00:00+00:00,The Equity Bull Case (5 Must-See Charts!),NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-equity-bull-case-5-must-see-charts,"Want to know what a market will do? Consulting a chart is the best way to see what will happen next, because charts are based on the simplest tenants of economics – supply and demand. Below are 5 must-see charts that suggest the market is closer to a bottom than you may think:
CNN Fear & Greed Index
The CNN Fear & Greed Index measures investor sentiment in the US equity market. Fear & Greed is derived through a composite of factors, including market trend, stock price strength, breadth (participation), put-to-call ratio, volatility, trading volume, and safe-haven demand. From its diverse bucket of metrics, CNN then creates a numerical score from 0 to 100, with 0 being extreme fear and 100 being extreme greed.
Spin: Fear & Greed is best used as a contrarian indicator. In the words of General George S. Patton, “If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn’t thinking.” The fact that CNN’s Fear & Greed Indicator is at an extreme greed level and is at the lowest level of 2023 should give bulls hope for a year-end rally.

The US Dollar
An overly strong US dollar can adversely affect US equities. For example, an inflated dollar can hurt the competitiveness of American exporters (US goods & services become more expensive), weigh on US-based multinationals (overseas earnings get transferred back into dollars, reducing corporate profits), and finally can detract foreign investment into US equities themselves.
Spin: The US Dollar Index (DXY) and the Invesco USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (UUP) are up eleven straight weeks and are approaching resistance (supply). A pullback in the US Dollar would be supportive of equities.

Image Source: TradingView
Seasonality
In 2023, historic seasonal trends have perhaps been the best, most accurate roadmap for investors. The pre-presidential election roadmap is the optimal roadmap for investors to consult. Typically, equities rally into the late summer (like in 2023) and bottom in late October.
Spin: Because seasonality has been so accurate, investors have little reason to abandon it now. Look for a rally into year-end.

SPY Weekly Trendline
In equity trading, trendline support refers to a specific price level or line on a chart representing a historical trend where the instrument’s price tends to find buying interest and bounce upward. Typically, trendlines are drawn as a straight, diagonal line and should cover at least three significant touches. Longer time frames tend to have more meaning for traders.
Spin: Thus far this week, the S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) found support at its weekly trendline nearly to the penny and reversed violently – a bullish sign.

Semis
Semiconductor stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are the lifeblood of the current bull market. Why? A major part of the bull case in equities is that the AI revolution will lead to higher earnings and allow high-tech stocks to grow into their seemingly lofty valuations.
Spin: The Direxion 3x PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOXL) stood out Thursday, rising more than 7% for the session while finding support at its 200-day moving average. Buying interest in semiconductors is indicative of a “risk on” mood.

Bottom Line

2023-09-29 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Amazon vs. AMD,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-amazon-vs.-amd,"There's been a slight pullback from investors in the tech market, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index down 9% since the start of August. Excitement over booming industries like artificial intelligence (AI) seems to have peaked as fears grow that macroeconomic headwinds could curb consumer spending through the coming holiday season.
The dip in the market presents a potential buying opportunity and an excellent time to consider making a long-term investment in tech. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) have shined as some of the industry's biggest players this year. While they have succeeded in wildly different areas of the industry, these companies could soon go head to head in the AI chip market.
As a result, it could be worth adding one of these companies to your list of holdings. So, let's find out whether Amazon or AMD is the better buy.
Amazon
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced in July that the company's next move in AI would see it venture into chip development. Nvidia has dominated the industry this year, with its 90% market share in AI graphic processing units (GPUs). Its command of the market has many companies calling for increased competition as it will reduce the cost of chips.
Amazon has responded to market demand by developing two new chips it calls Inferentia and Trainium, which Jassy has promised will deliver ""much better price-performance than you'll find anywhere else."" The company isn't massively experienced in chip production. However, its years of dominance in cloud computing with Amazon Web Services (AWS) have likely given it the knowledge and brand recognition to become a major player in the industry.
In addition to chips, Amazon is continuing its aggressive expansion into AI by investing up to $4 billion in Anthropic, a competitor to ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The collaboration will provide AWS members with early access to various AI features and models.
Amazon has rallied investors this year with its AI efforts and a return to profitability in its e-commerce business. The company has a solid outlook and could offer stockholders significant gains in the coming years.
Advanced Micro Devices
Like Amazon, AMD has pulled out all the stops for its AI expansion this year in an effort to eventually steal market share from Nvidia. The company unveiled the next entry in its MI300 line of chips in June, calling it its most powerful GPU ever. The new chip is expected to begin shipping in 2024. It remains to be seen what companies will sign on to use AMD's latest hardware, but the company has massive support across tech. If it can debut the chip at competitive pricing, the company could be in for a boost to earnings as it attracts new clients.
Moreover, AMD acquired AI software firm Mipsology last month as it works to develop a platform that can be used in conjunction with its GPUs to produce AI models, similar to Nvidia's CUDA. AMD is playing the long game in AI after falling behind. However, its years of success as a leading chipmaker could play to its advantage.
AMD released its second-quarter 2023 earnings on Aug. 1, reporting an 18% year-over-year decrease in revenue after declines in multiple segments. The company continued to suffer from a burdened PC market and macroeconomic headwinds. Meanwhile, it has yet to see any returns on its investment in AI. As a result, AMD shares have tumbled 18% since posting its Q2 results.
AMD's dip could be a smart investment, but prospective stockholders should be prepared to invest for the long haul.
Is Amazon or AMD the better buy this month?
Amazon and AMD have swiftly expanding positions in AI and could grow into key players in the chip market over the long term. However, Amazon is the more reliable buy for now. Both companies have yet to see any significant returns from their ventures into AI, so the success of their other businesses is crucial.
AMD has suffered revenue declines across multiple segments this year. Meanwhile, Amazon's e-commerce business has enjoyed a solid return to profits. In Q2 2023, its North American segment hit over $3 billion in operating income after reporting $627 million in losses a year ago. Meanwhile, its cloud platform AWS delivered a 12% rise in revenue.
Amazon's business is on a positive trajectory before seeing any significant gains from AI. Compared to AMD's recent tumbles in earnings, Amazon is the better and safer buy right now.

2023-10-02 00:00:00+00:00,2 Cathie Wood Stocks That Could Deliver Exponential Returns,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-cathie-wood-stocks-that-could-deliver-exponential-returns,"Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood is the ultimate thematic investor. Her flagship fund, Ark Innovation ETF focuses on disruptive new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous vehicles, genomic medicine, molecular diagnostics, and cutting-edge medical devices. This style of investing can generate enormous returns on capital in an exceedingly short period of time. But it also tends to come with a high degree of volatility and an elevated level of risk.
Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RXRX) and Exact Sciences (NASDAQ: EXAS), two of Wood's larger biopharma holdings across her family of tech-oriented ETFs, are prime examples of the pros and cons associated with thematic investing. Both of these biotechnology stocks soared earlier this year due to an abrupt shift in investor sentiment at the start of the year. But they have since pulled back in a big way in response to concerns over the global economy, lingering inflation, and elevated interest rates.

Here's why bargain hunters may want to buy shares of both of these ultra-high-tech bio companies in October.
Recursion Pharmaceuticals: AI-powered drug development
Recursion Pharmaceuticals is a pioneer in techbio, an innovative new field of healthcare that integrates artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, chemistry, conventional laboratory methods, and clinical trials. Techbio aims to spur the development of novel drugs by analyzing large biological/chemical datasets using highly sophisticated computational methods.
At the heart of Recursion Pharmaceuticals' core value proposition is its platform, Recursion OS. Recursion OS allows researchers to explore massive biological and chemical datasets, and test hypotheses virtually. The company's ultimate goal is to reduce the time and cost of drug discovery/development.
Why is Recursion Pharmaceuticals stock a buy this month? This techbio play stands out as an intriguing speculative buy for three reasons:
Recursion OS has the potential to unlock multiple new blockbuster therapeutics in high-growth areas such as rare diseases and oncology.
The company has a proven ability to attract top-shelf partners in both tech and biopharma. Underscoring this point, Recursion Pharmaceuticals has active collaborations with Bayer, Nvidia, and Roche.
Recursion Pharmaceuticals has a direct link to the burgeoning field of AI. While the field of AI-powered drug discovery is still in its infancy, most industry insiders think this approach could significantly streamline this enormously costly and time-consuming process.
What's the risk? The techbio's cash runway isn't particularly extensive and its value proposition could take some time to come to fruition. As a result, Recursion Pharmaceuticals will probably have to rely on shareholder dilution to fund operations in the short term. Prospective shareholders, in turn, may want to keep their initial position on the small side. However, this techbio does have the potential to become an integral part of the massive drug discovery and development landscape, which qualifies it as a possible hidden gem.
Exact Sciences: A cancer diagnostic pioneer
Exact Sciences is a molecular diagnostic company. It is best known for Cologuard, its non-invasive, at-home colorectal cancer screening test. Cologuard has been on the U.S. market since 2014, where it has steadily earned market share as an alternative to colonoscopy. Bullish analysts think Cologuard could be a major revenue driver for the company for perhaps the next 10 years, especially if the company scores a Food and Drug Administration green light for Cologuard 2.0, a more precise version of the stool-based test, next year. However, bears think the colon cancer test could lose market share to next-generation liquid biopsies in the years ahead.
Exact Sciences isn't standing pat, however. The company has been busy expanding its portfolio to include new diagnostics for a broad array of cancers. To speed up this effort, Exact Sciences acquired two companies in 2020: Thrive Earlier Detection, which is developing a blood-based test capable of detecting multiple cancers at early stages; and Base Genomics, which specializes in DNA methylation analysis, a technique that can identify cancer-specific signals in blood samples. If the company's efforts bear fruit in these areas, it should stand on top of the emerging field of non-invasive cancer diagnostics – a market expected to grow by leaps and bounds in the years ahead.
Now, Exact Sciences still has work to do to reach profitability on a consistent basis, and there are important competitive risk factors to consider before buying shares. But this cancer screening company does have a strong track record of innovation in an area widely expected to become a vital part of cancer care over the next 10 years.
What's the bottom line? Exact Sciences stock will likely remain on the volatile side while these competitive dynamics play out. But the company should be able to grow in lockstep with the broader molecular diagnostic space, a market estimated to balloon into a $145 billion-a-year revenue generator by 2028. To put this into the proper context, Exact Sciences currently sports a market cap of only $12.3 billion at the time of this writing.

2023-10-05 00:00:00+00:00,Keysight (KEYS) Solution Boosts Satellite Communication Testing,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/keysight-keys-solution-boosts-satellite-communication-testing,"Keysight Technologies, Inc. KEYS recently unveiled a cutting-edge Phased Array Antenna Control and Calibration solution designed for efficient testing of satellite communication systems. The technology is the latest addition to the Keysight S7601A antenna measurement toolset. It offers a comprehensive solution that facilitates testing for a wide range of antennas used in diverse applications such as cellular, automotive and satellite communications. Keysight’s new solution encompasses some unique features that minimize testing durations and empower engineers to overcome manufacturing complexities with ease.

The industry is witnessing a growing proliferation of phased arrays in both commercial and military satcom systems. The previously used parabolic dish has a fixed directional beam and various mechanical complexities. The modern phased array antennas can electronically adjust their beams, enabling precise and seamless positioning. However, efficient testing of this complex system is a challenging endeavor. Engineers need an automated testing facility to streamline the intricate and time-consuming validation procedure of such complex systems.  

Keysight’s flexible measurement solution incorporates a proprietary calibration algorithm feature. This allows precise gain and phase measurements, even in a far-field test setup for individual phased array components. The over-the-air calibration and characterization solution integrates all functions into an intuitive software interface. This enables engineers to seamlessly control the high-performance test instruments, the compact positioning equipment and the temperature control unit for the antenna under test.

It supports a wide range of testing procedures, including gain and phase calibration, beam scan analysis, cross-polarization isolation and more. The cutting-edge solution optimizes frequency, gain and phase response to augment signal-pointing accuracy.
 
The advanced features of the new Phased Array Antenna Control and Calibration solution will likely accelerate the development of next-generation satellite communication systems. This latest innovation will broaden Keysight's robust portfolio and reinforce its position as a leading provider of electronic design and test systems.

The company is gaining traction with strong industry-wide growth. It is witnessing solid adoption of its electronic design and test solutions. Electronic devices form the fulcrum of IoT services, wireless devices, data centers and 5G technologies. The rapid adoption of these devices is increasing demand for electronics testing equipment.

Keysight boasts a robust 5G portfolio. Its 5G product design validation solutions, ranging from Layer 1 to 7, enable telecom and semiconductor companies to accelerate their 5G initiatives. Apart from strength in the 5G domain, the company is expected to benefit from the growing proliferation of electronic content in vehicles, momentum in space and satellite applications, and rising adoption of driver-assistance systems globally.

Shares of the company have declined 22.4% over the past year compared with the industry’s fall of 13.8%.

2023-10-09 00:00:00+00:00,Does Nvidia (NVDA) Have the Potential to Rally 37.24% as Wall Street Analysts Expect?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/does-nvidia-nvda-have-the-potential-to-rally-37.24-as-wall-street-analysts-expect,"Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) have gained 0.4% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $457.62, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $628.03 indicates a potential upside of 37.2%.
The average comprises 34 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $460 to a high of $1,100, with a standard deviation of $114.49. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 0.5% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 140.4% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.
While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.
However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in NVDA. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.
Here's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price Targets
According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.
While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?
They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.
However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.
That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.
Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in NVDA
Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.2% over the past month, as two estimates have gone higher compared to no negative revision.
Moreover, NVDA currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much NVDA could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.

2023-10-11 00:00:00+00:00,The 3 Widest Competitive Moats on Wall Street,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-3-widest-competitive-moats-on-wall-street,"Competitive Moat: The Holy Grail of Longevity
In ancient times, a moat was a deep, wide ditch usually filled with water that encircled a castle fort or town. The primary purpose of a moat was to provide a defensive barrier against attackers. The depth and water in the moat made it difficult for enemies to approach the castle’s walls, providing the defenders with a significant advantage. The moat acted as a deterrent, slowing down or stopping the advance of enemy soldiers, siege engines, or other threats.
If you have ever watched the hit show “Shark Tank” on ABC, you probably understand what a moat is. On Shark Tank, entrepreneurs pitch their business to successful business people, who, if they like the idea, will invest their money for a percentage or all of the business. A main pushback by the “sharks” is the ability to duplicate a business. Even if a business is profitable in the near-term, if the competitive advantage is not sustainable over time, the company is vulnerable to imitation from the competition.
In modern-day business, the moat concept acts as a metaphor used to describe a company’s sustainable advantage. Like its ancient counterpart, a business moat refers to unique qualities or advantages that protect a company from competitors and external threats. Below are 3 stocks with the most signficant competitive moats currently:
Nvidia (NVDA)
Chip-maker Nvidia has a foothold in the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) chip market and holds more than 70% market share in the space. Why is Nvidia so dominant? Nvidia was the first mover in the industry. More than a decade ago, iconic founder and CEO Jensen Huang recognized the potential of AI and shifted his company’s focus to making chips specifically for AI.
Nvidia’s competitive moat lies in the fact that the company began with a head start and is the fastest at iterating and creating new and improved chips. For competition, trying to surmount the head start that NVDA has is akin to a hamster trying to make progress in a hamster wheel. Beyond its best-in-class chips, NVDA offers a full suite of products and services, making it a one-stop-shop for AI. For this reason, many customers prefer to wait months for an NVDA chip rather than buying the competition. The results speak for themselves. Last quarter, NVDA earnings rocketed 429%.

Tesla (TSLA)
In the early 2000s, an electric vehicle enjoyable to drive with reasonable range was a pipe dream. That is until Elon Musk came along. The story is well known – Musk parlayed his winnings from the Paypal (PYPL) sale to create the world’s first successful EV. However, even still, Tesla remained a relatively niche product for consumers willing to spend upwards of $50,000 on an electric vehicle.
However, after years of working on the manufacturing process (and help from government subsidies), the average price of a Tesla is in line with the average cost of a new car.

That’s great news for Tesla investors. Tesla is already enjoying catalysts such as sky-high gas prices and labor disputes at Stellantis (STLA), General Motors (GM), and Ford (F). Like Nvidia, Tesla’s competitors will have difficulty catching up to Tesla’s competitive moat.
Novo Nordisk (NVO)
Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes when diet and exercise alone are insufficient. In other words, it’s the world’s first mainstream, effective fat-loss pill. Just how popular is Ozempic? Novo Nordisk’s market cap has soared to more than $400 billion, greater than the annual GDP of its home country, Denmark! Meanwhile, EPS is set to grow from $4 to ~$* by 2026 – massive for a company of this size.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Because of the intense approval process, the pharmaceutical industry is one of the most cut-throat industries. This morning, NVO’s weight loss drug showed it may treat kidney failure. Competitors like DaVita (DVA), Baxter International (BAX), and Medtronic (MDT) plunged.
Conclusion
Competitive moats symbolize a company’s sustainable advantage, protecting it from competitors and external threats. Three standout examples illustrate this principle vividly.

2023-10-12 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-Biden eyes adding AI chip curbs to Chinese companies abroad,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-biden-eyes-adding-ai-chip-curbs-to-chinese-companies-abroad,"By Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld
Oct 12 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is considering closing a loophole that gives Chinese companies access to American artificial intelligence (AI) chips through units located overseas, according to four people familiar with the matter.
The United States last year shook relations with Beijing when it unveiled new restrictions on shipments of AI chips and chipmaking tools to China, seeking to thwart its military advances. Those rules are set to be tightened in the coming days. A person familiar with the situation said the measure could be included in those new restrictions.
In the initial round of curbs, the Biden administration left overseas subsidiaries of Chinese companies with unfettered access to the same semiconductors, meaning they could easily be smuggled into China or accessed remotely by China-based users.
Reuters reported in June that the very chips barred by U.S. regulations could be purchased from vendors in the famed Huaqiangbei electronics area in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.
Washington is now mulling ways to close the loophole, sources said, a move that has not been previously reported.
The efforts to close the loophole show how the Biden administration is struggling to cut China off from top AI technology and how difficult it is to plug every gap in export controls.
""Absolutely, Chinese firms are purchasing chips for use in data centers abroad,"" said Greg Allen, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noting that Singapore is a big hub for cloud computing.
The Commerce Department declined to comment. A representative from the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China's Ministry of Commerce has previously accused the U.S. of abusing export controls and called for it to ""stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies.""
While it would be illegal under U.S. law to ship those AI chips to mainland China, it is very difficult for the United States to police those transactions, experts said, noting that China-based employees could legally access the chips located at foreign subsidiaries remotely as well.
""We don't actually know how big a problem this is,"" said Hanna Dohmen, a Research Analyst at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET).
The United States has been seeking to halt the rise of China's artificial intelligence capability, which helps its military develop unmanned combat systems, according to a report in The International Affairs Review, affiliated with George Washington University’s School of International Affairs.
Washington has been working to close other loopholes that allow the AI chips into China. In August, it told Nvidia and AMD to restrict shipments of the AI chips beyond China to other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.
Sources said the new rules on AI chips expected this month will likely apply those same restrictions more broadly to all companies in the market.
It is less clear how the U.S. government might close the loophole allowing Chinese parties to access U.S. cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, which give their customers access to the same AI capabilities. But sources say the Biden administration is grappling with that issue as well.
""Chinese persons can completely legally access the same chips from anywhere in the world. There are no rules about how they can be accessed,"" said Timothy Fist, a fellow at Washington-based think tank Center for a New American Security.

************
Let the chips fall where they may.
You may say that when you need to convince yourself to do whatever you have to do without worrying too much about the consequences… to concentrate on what’s important and not sweat the small stuff.
The expression dates to the 1800s as a reference to the flying shards (“chips”) that are created when you chop wood. It was a reminder to focus on cutting logs and not worry about where the chips flew away to.
However, when it comes to semiconductor chips, companies focused on creating artificial intelligence (AI) applications can’t be so passive about the chips they use.
And now, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is readying the debut of its own homegrown chip designed for AI processing.
So, in today’s Market 360, let’s dive into the details of the newest semiconductor chip expected to join competitors. Then, I’ll share how you can access my stock-picking system to find the best stocks.
Seattle’s Best… Chip
While the chip’s official name isn’t known yet, its codename is a nod to the Greek goddess of wisdom and handicraft: Athena. (Interestingly enough, Athena also presides over warfare – and tech companies have certainly been battling it out in the AI Revolution.)
Microsoft will likely debut Athena during its Ignite Conference in Seattle, set for mid-November.
The chip is designed for Microsoft’s data center servers that train and run large language models (LLMs). LLMs are the software behind generative AI features, like ChatGPT and other conversational chatbots.
The rest of the chip’s performance details aren’t known yet. So, we likely will have to wait until November to learn more.
Microsoft expects Athena to reduce its reliance on NVIDIA Corporation’s (NVDA) AI chips. The Seattle-based tech giant’s data centers currently use Nvidia’s GPUs, or graphics processing units, to power its LLMs for its cloud customers.
However, demand for NVIDIA’s AI chips has been so intense that tech companies’ needs have exceeded NVIDIA’s supply. Microsoft, along with other companies, has had a tough time acquiring the chips required for AI processing.
As we all know from Economics 101, this supply-demand imbalance has led to NVIDIA’s chips creeping up in price… big time. NVIDIA’s H100 GPU, its highest-end AI chip, now goes for $40,000.
By utilizing its own chips, Microsoft could cut costs substantially.
However, NVIDIA’s semis are still the preferred AI chips among most tech companies, so Microsoft will have to work hard if it wants to attract outside users to its AI chips.
When it comes to this budding “homegrown” AI chip trend, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) also has its own, called Inferentia and Trainium.
Microsoft may be a smidge late to the semiconductor game – but we don’t think this is a sign of it letting its chips “fall where they may.”
How AI Can Help Create Your Portfolio
With every new advancement in artificial intelligence, it seems like if you’re not incorporating AI into your personal investing, you’ll be smoked by the people who are.
The good news is that it’s still early enough in this trend that you can still invest in the AI revolution.
And if you’re not sure where to look, AI can also help get you started.
Now, I’ve been using AI prototypes for decades. My proprietary stock-picking system is based on eight factors that I determined are most responsible for whether a stock will go up or down over the long term.
I’m now combining my own system with another form of AI built by colleagues who tested it against my own criteria. This is the “superpower” system that I’ve been waiting for after all my decades of building computer systems to beat the market.
We call it the New Intelligence.
The reality is that AI can do things with data no human or human-trained system can do on their own… and that’s because we simply don’t have the same capacity to analyze information.
The New Intelligence is able to calculate data in a way no human analyst ever could to make a prediction with a high probability of success.
This AI breakthrough is the culmination of my 40-year career in the financial markets – and it goes hand in hand with a huge new prediction I’m making.
I gave all the details in my special AI Breakthrough event held last night.

2023-10-16 00:00:00+00:00,Logitech (LOGI) to Launch PS5 Adaptive Gaming Kit Next Year,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/logitech-logi-to-launch-ps5-adaptive-gaming-kit-next-year,"Logitech International's LOGI brand, Logitech G, has announced the upcoming release of the Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit for the PlayStation 5 (PS5) Access controller in January 2024. Logitech and Sony are collaborating to launch this kit to offer customizable options to enable gamers with disabilities to enjoy their gaming experiences.
The kit includes a variety of high-performance and durable buttons and triggers that are specifically designed to meet the accessibility needs of gamers. It also features gaming-grade mechanical button switches, adjustable trigger controls, custom PS5 controller labels, velcro ties and a host of other options for optimal setup and customization.
The Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit for the Access controller will be accessible for purchase through both the Logitech G website and selected retail outlets. The users must have a PS5 Console and Access controller to utilize the Adaptive Gaming Kit.

The launch of the Adaptive Gaming Kit is part of a series of product launches in the second quarter of 2024, which also included the Logitech G PRO X TKL LIGHTSPEED Gaming Keyboard, Logitech G PRO X SUPERLIGHT 2 Gaming Mouse, Wave Keys Keyboards and the latest generation of Yeti microphones.
Shares of Logitech have outperformed the Zacks Computer – Peripheral Equipment industry in the year-to-date (YTD) period. Shares of LOGI have gained 14.2% YTD compared with the Computer – Peripheral Equipment industry’s rise of 2.1%.
Logitech Focuses on Expanding Product Portfolio
Logitech intends to tap the high-potential market for accessories by pursuing innovation and expanding its product lines. The company has manufactured innovative offerings like the fastest performing mouse and keyboard switches, wireless mouse with longest battery and multi-device keyboards, among others.
LOGI is also expanding its product portfolio through acquisitions. In July 2023, it acquired Finland’s Loupedeck. The acquisition is expected to enhance Logitech’s ability to provide customizable and contextual control experiences for the company’s full portfolio of devices, including the Logitech Software Roadmap solution.
Loupedeck offers deep native integrations with industry-leading creative software for photo editing, retouching, video editing, color grading design and streaming. Its custom consoles combine analog control with digital precision to offer power and flexibility to all creators. With this buyout, Logitech will leverage Loupedeck’s strong and growing developer community that will unveil advanced innovation, empowering streamers, creators and gamers.
LOGI’s sustained focus on introducing new and innovative products might boost sales and somewhat offset the negative impact of the weakened demand for PC peripheral products. In 2020 and 2021, Logitech benefited from the elevated demand for its Video Collaboration, PC Webcams, Keyboards & Combos and Pointing Device tools, mainly driven by the heightening of work-from-home and learn-from-home trends.
However, the weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues enhanced global recessionary concerns, thereby prompting enterprises to postpone their large IT spending plan. Furthermore, continued industry layoffs due to growing recessionary concerns are hampering the demand for PC peripheral products by organizations.
The aforementioned factors are hurting Logitech’s financial performance. In first-quarter fiscal 2024, the company’s revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share declined 16% and 12%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.
Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to Consider
Currently, Logitech carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

TAIPEI, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn 2317.TW, the world's largest contract manufacturer, will build artificial intelligence data factories using Nvidia NVDA.O chips and software to make products including self-driving cars, the companies said on Wednesday.
Sharing a stage at Foxconn's annual Tech Day in Taipei, Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said their companies were building AI factories together.
Huang showed a hand-drawn sketch of what the two companies are building, which he called an ""AI factory"".
""This is a factory that takes data input and produces intelligence as an output,"" he said. ""In the future, every company, every industry, will have AI factories.""
What Nvidia and Foxconn are building is an entire end-to-end AI system for autonomous electric vehicles, with the AI factory developing the car's software, Huang added.
""This car would of course go through life experience and collect more data. The data would go to the AI factory, the AI factory would improve the software and update the entire AI fleet,"" he said.
""This entire end-to-end system, on the one hand AI factory, on the other end EV fleet, is what Nvidia and Foxconn are building.""

2023-10-18 00:00:00+00:00,Beyond Nvidia: Avoid These At-Risk Chip Stocks as U.S.-China Tensions Rise,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/beyond-nvidia%3A-avoid-these-at-risk-chip-stocks-as-u.s.-china-tensions-rise,"The U.S. Commerce Department this week has expanded its restrictions on chip exports to China. Unsurprisingly, many large-cap semiconductor stocks fell yesterday, considering their high revenue exposure to the world’s second-largest economy. 
While Nvidia (NVDA) is getting outsized attention on this news – which is justified, given its trillion-dollar market cap and status as the bellwether of artificial intelligence (AI) chip demand – there are other chip stocks investors should also look to avoid if you expect the ongoing tensions between the world’s two largest economies to result in deeper and broader export curbs going forward. 
www.barchart.com
U.S.-China Tensions Are On the Rise
U.S.-China relations have been on the decline for years now. In 2018, former President Donald Trump took on China over the burgeoning trade deficit, and imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of imports from China. While the actual positive impact of these tariffs on the U.S. economy and job markets is debatable (and polarizing) – it nonetheless raised important questions about the lopsided trade relations between the two countries.
Unlike the Trump administration - which more or less went for the carpet-bombing approach in trying to address the U.S. trade imbalance, and imposed tariffs on not only China, but many strategic allies as well - the Biden administration has taken a more focused approach, and has been trying to support on-shoring through legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act, with the latter intended to boost U.S. chip manufacturing capacity and reduce reliance on imports.
U.S. Restricts Sales of AI Chips to China
Another pillar of the current administration’s strategy has been to limit exports of high-end chips and other cutting-edge technology to China. Last year, the Commerce Department imposed restrictions on exports of some high-end chips, like Nvidia’s A100 and H100 processors – to which Nvidia responded by coming up with A800 and H800 chips, which were designed specifically for China.
The current regulations impose a ban on these two chips, and are also expected to impact sales of AI chips from chipmakers like Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Also, any new set of chips with processing power just below what’s currently restricted would need prior approval for exports to China – effectively closing a loophole that had previously provided a workaround to chipmakers.
Generally speaking, it would be reasonable to expect further escalation in U.S.-China tensions - no matter whether you term it as the “new Cold War,” “trade war,” “tech war,” or “AI war.” 
Which Chip Stocks Have the Highest Exposure to China?
Data compiled by Kearney shows that while names like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel get roughly a quarter of their revenues from China, the number is much higher for Qualcomm (QCOM) and Texas Instruments (TXN) - both of which derive over half of their revenues from the nation. Monolithic Power (MPWR) is another chip company that gets over half of its revenues from China.
Looking at the YTD price action, there is a wide disparity among chipmakers. Nvidia is, of course, not only outperforming chip stocks, but it's also the best-performing S&P 500 Index ($SPX) stock of the year, with gains of roughly 190%. AMD is up over 59%, while Intel has gained 37% YTD.
However, Texas Instruments stock is in the red for 2023, while Qualcomm is up just about 2.5% to underperform the broader markets by a wide margin. 
In terms of valuation, Texas Instruments trades at a price-to-sales multiple of 6.9x which is higher than both Intel and Qualcomm; however, the stock has historically traded at a premium due to its higher profit margins and better return on assets. 
www.barchart.com
Nvidia - which in the past has tried to play down the export ban on China, citing strong demand for AI chips elsewhere - said in its SEC filing yesterday, “The licensing requirement may impact the Company's ability to complete development of products in a timely manner, support existing customers of covered products, or supply customers of covered products outside the impacted regions, and may require the Company to transition certain operations out of one or more of the identified countries.”  It listed the chips that would be impacted by the export ban, and apart from A800 and H800, sales of L40, L40S, and RTX 4090 would also be barred under the new rules.
Rising China Tensions Spell Trouble for Many U.S. Companies
Meanwhile, rising U.S.-China tensions spell trouble not only for chip companies, but also for other companies that have significant exposure to China – Apple (AAPL) and Nike (NKE), for instance. Incidentally, amid reports of sluggish iPhone 15 sales in China, Apple CEO Tim Cook made a surprise visit to the country – his second for this year.
Jefferies analysts believe that Huawei – whose operations suffered a near-death blow after restrictions by the U.S. – has bounced back and dethroned Apple from the top position in the Chinese smartphone market. While Cook has in the past downplayed any boycott threats in China, reports of Apple losing market share in the country to homegrown Huawei tell a somewhat different story.
Meanwhile, it will be crucial to watch how China reacts to the new set of export restrictions by the U.S. In the past, China has retaliated against U.S. actions – most recently when it banned sales of some Micron (MU) products over “national security concerns.” While Nvidia currently seems to be the most significantly impacted by the chip export restrictions, many more companies - including those not in the chip business - would be drawn into the line of fire if U.S.-China tensions continue to flare up.

2023-10-19 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia Stock Slips… But It’s Time to Buy the China AI Chip Dip,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-slips...-but-its-time-to-buy-the-china-ai-chip-dip,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
What goes up must come down. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) investors have learned that the hard way this week. The semiconductor giant’s stock has tumbled about 10% in the past five days due to concerns about President Joe Biden’s crackdown on the sale of artificial intelligence chips to China. Nvidia is a leading player in the world of AI.
Adding to the short-term pain for Nvidia? Analysts at Citi and Morgan Stanley both cut their cut price targets on the stock this week following the news about China. The two firms each previously had a price target of $630. Morgan Stanley lowered its to $600 while Citi dropped its forecast to $575. Morgan Stanley called the new White House restrictions “a significant setback.”
But are the growing economic and tech tensions between America and China just an excuse to take some Nvidia profits off the table? After all, Nvidia’s stock is still up nearly 200% this year, a much bigger gain than rivals Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as well as the broader Philadelphia Semiconductor Index and the Nasdaq.
The optimism about Nvidia, a company that is now worth more than $1 trillion, is warranted. Analysts expect the company’s revenue to more than double this fiscal year (which ends in January 2024) and surge another 50% in the following year. Wall Street has steadily boosted its earnings forecasts for the company over the past few months. Nvidia is now expected to post earnings gains of nearly 80% a year over the next three to five years.
Despite these amazingly strong fundamentals, the stock still trades at a reasonable valuation of about 25 times earnings estimates for Nvidia’s next fiscal year.
It’s also worth noting that even though Citi and Morgan Stanley trimmed their price targets on Nvidia, they did not cut their ratings. Citi reiterated its “buy” call on Nvidia while Morgan Stanley maintained its “outperform” recommendation on the stock.
The rest of Wall Street continues to be extremely bullish on Nvidia as well. According to TipRanks, 37 of the 38 analysts who cover the stock have it rated a “buy” and the consensus price target for Nvidia is about $645.50… more than 50% above its current price.
The Bottom Line on NVDA Stock
The bottom line? Nvidia is a diversified company whose graphic processors are used in video games, for crypto mining and numerous other applications beyond artificial intelligence. Nvidia also generates just 20% of its overall revenue from China, including Hong Kong. That’s obviously still a significant chunk of sales, but not enough to derail Nvidia’s global dominance.
Investors should find out more about the impact of the frosty U.S.-China relations on Nvidia next month when the company reports earnings for its fiscal third quarter on Nov. 21. Nvidia easily topped consensus forecasts in its previous three quarters. So, buying the stock now before results are released could be a good bet.

2023-10-20 00:00:00+00:00,ANALYSIS-US chip curbs give Huawei a chance to fill the Nvidia void in China,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-us-chip-curbs-give-huawei-a-chance-to-fill-the-nvidia-void-in-china,"By Josh Ye
HONG KONG, Oct 20 (Reuters) - U.S. measures to limit the export of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China may create an opening for Huawei Technologies [RIC:RIC:HWT.UL] to expand in its $7 billion home market as the curbs force Nvidia to retreat, analysts say.
While Nvidia NVDA.O has historically been the leading provider of AI chips in China with a market share exceeding 90%, Chinese firms including Huawei have been developing their own versions of Nvidia’s best-selling chips, including the A100 and the H100 graphics processing units (GPU).
Huawei's Ascend AI chips are comparable to Nvidia's in terms of raw computing power, analysts and some AI firms such as China's iFlyTek 002230.SZ say, but they still lag behind in performance.
Jiang Yifan, chief market analyst at brokerage Guotai Junan Securities, said another key limiting factor for Chinese firms was the reliance of most projects on Nvidia's chips and software ecosystem, but that could change with the U.S. restrictions.
""This U.S. move, in my opinion, is actually giving Huawei's Ascend chips a huge gift,"" Jiang said in a post on his social media Weibo account.
This opportunity, however, comes with several challenges.
Many cutting edge AI projects are built with CUDA, a popular programming architecture Nvidia has pioneered, which has in turn given rise to a massive global ecosystem that has become capable of training highly sophisticated AI models such as OpenAI's GPT-4.
Huawei own version is called CANN, and analysts say it is much more limited in terms of the AI models it is capable of training, meaning that Huawei's chips are far from a plug-and-play substitute for Nvidia.
Woz Ahmed, a former chip design executive turned consultant, said that for Huawei to win Chinese clients from Nvidia, it must replicate the ecosystem Nvidia created, including supporting clients to move their data and models to Huawei's own platform.
Intellectual property rights are also a problem, as many U.S. firms already hold key patents for GPUs, Ahmed said.
""To get something that's in the ballpark, it is 5 or 10 years,"" he added.
Huawei and Nvidia did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
COMPUTING POWER
Huawei rolled out the first Ascend GPUs that year and it is one of a number of products - such as its Harmony operating system - that the company says are entirely homegrown.
Over the past year, the telecoms giant has shown signs that it is beating back against the U.S. curbs by unveiling an advanced smartphone chip and making claims of breakthroughs in chip design tools.
It has also set its sights on becoming a key provider of computing power for AI, with Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou saying last month that Huawei wanted to build a computing base for China and give the world a ""second option"", in a veiled reference to dominant provider the United States.
Huawei's partners in China so far include iFlyTek, a leading Chinese AI software company which is using the Ascend 910 to train its AI models. IFlyTek was also blacklisted by the United States in 2019.
On Thursday, during iFlyTek'searnings call Senior Vice President Jiang Tao said the Ascend 910B's capabilities were ""comparable to Nvidia's A100"" and announced that it was developing a general-purpose AI infrastructure in China alongside Huawei.
""Our partnership now aims to enable domestically developed LLMs to be built with both homegrown hardware and software technology,"" Jiang said.
Other partners include state-owned software firms Tsinghua Tongfang and Digital China. At a conference in July, Huawei said its AI chips now help power more than 30 large language models (LLM) in China, which is going through a generative AI craze and currently has more than 130 LLMs.
Charlie Chai, an analyst with 86Research, said Nvidia's ecosystem dominance was not ""an insurmountable obstacle if domestic players are given sufficient time and a big customer base"".
China's self-sufficiency push, which has been championed by President Xi Jinping, is likely to aid this. ""In short, a small disruption to near-term supplies, but a big boost to the long-term self-sufficiency agenda,"" Chai added.

NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Global hedge funds reduced their exposure to mega cap tech stocks in recent days, ahead of the companies' third-quarter earnings, two Wall Street banks said.
Microsoft MSFT.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O, Amazon AMZN.O and Meta Platforms META.O - four of the seven U.S. megacap stocks whose gains have powered the S&P 500 higher this year while the rest of the index has lagged - have earnings due this week. Apple AAPL.O and Nvidia NVDA.O are set to report next month.
Overall, the megacap companies are expected to post a 32.8% gain in earnings for the full year, while the rest of the S&P 500 sees a 2.3% decline over the same time, according to LSEG.
""We’d note that hedge funds have trimmed a bit of megacap tech risk recently. We’ve seen some long selling and short additions among the group,"" JPMorgan Chase's positioning intelligence unit wrote in a note, taking into account how its clients rotated portfolios.
Goldman Sachs Group GS.N showed a similar trend, adding hedge funds have net sold megacap tech stocks in the past two weeks.
Still, both banks, which manage two of the Wall Street's biggest prime brokerage units, said megacap tech stocks continue to account for a relevant part of hedge fund's book.
Goldman Sachs said megacaps account for almost 20% of its hedge funds' clients total U.S. single stock net exposure, versus around 8% in January. ""(It) is still near record highs, as managers have been selling other stocks at a much more rapid pace,"" Vincent Lin, Goldman's co-head of prime insights.
As hedge funds have also been selling stocks in other sectors, total exposure to megacap tech stocks remain at close to record levels back to 2018, JPMorgan said.

2023-10-25 00:00:00+00:00,Can Micron Stock Hit $100 Per Share?,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-micron-stock-hit-%24100-per-share,"Investors’ enthusiasm remains high for artificial intelligence (AI) related stocks, with Microsoft (MSFT) moving higher today after strong AI-driven earnings, and industry leader Nvidia (NVDA) boasting a remarkable year-to-date gain of approximately 185%. While Nvidia, thanks to its advanced computing platform and graphics processing units (GPUs), remains a dominant force in building AI systems, there are other attractive options for investors seeking opportunities in the space. One compelling AI stock is Micron (MU), which is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing adoption and deployment of AI solutions.
Micron stock has gained over 34% year-to-date, despite significant challenges related to inventory and pricing. And looking ahead, at least one Wall Street analyst expects the semiconductor stock to reach $100 - the Street-high price target - in the next 12 months. Let’s see why.
www.barchart.com
Room to Reaccelerate in 2024
Micron serves the semiconductor memory and storage markets. Its products are used in various industries, including the industrial, automotive, and consumer markets (smartphones and PCs). Further, storage and memory solutions also power the advancement of transformative technologies, like AI and 5G applications. 
Fiscal year 2023 proved to be a challenging period for Micron, as it grappled with an excess of memory and storage inventory held by distribution partners, softer selling prices, and sluggish demand in the end market. Nevertheless, during the Q4 conference call, the company emphasized a positive shift in the landscape. Micron pointed out that customer inventories for memory and storage in the PC and smartphone sectors have returned to normal levels, with similar trends evident across customers in the automotive market. These developments are anticipated to fuel a recovery in volume for Micron in fiscal year 2024. 
Furthermore, the company expressed optimism that pricing has bottomed out. As demand starts to pick up, Micron stands to benefit from an improved pricing environment.
The company’s CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, expects growth to reaccelerate in 2024, despite macro headwinds posing a challenge. Mehrotra said, “While macroeconomic factors remain a risk, we expect robust year-over-year bit demand growth in calendar 2024 for both DRAM and NAND, driven by improving end-market demand, normalized customer inventory levels, content growth across products, and ongoing growth in AI.” 
He added that supply will fall behind industry demand growth in calendar year 2024, which will further strengthen the pace of recovery.  
AI Provides Solid Opportunities for Growth
Micron stated that the data center customer inventory is also improving, and will likely normalize in early calendar year 2024. Consequently, the company expects demand to continue to strengthen, which will drive pricing. 
Additionally, Micron's management has noted robust demand for AI servers, as customers redirect their budgets from conventional servers to the higher-priced AI server segment. In light of the surging demand, Micron is projecting an acceleration in total server unit growth for the calendar year 2024. 
The company has also indicated that data center revenue has reached its low point, and it anticipates growth to resume in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Furthermore, Micron is optimistic about sustaining its momentum in data center revenue throughout 2024 and 2025. 
Micron is also strengthening its portfolio of solutions to capitalize on AI-led opportunities. The company has unveiled its HBM3E product offering, and anticipates commencing the production ramp of HBM3E in early 2024. Moreover, Micron envisions significant revenue generation from HBM3E in fiscal year 2024. 
In addition to the data center, Micron anticipates a mid-single-digit percentage increase in PC volume for the calendar year 2024. The company foresees that AI-enabled PCs will be instrumental in stimulating content growth and enhancing the refresh cycle in the coming two years. Similar to PCs, Micron expects that AI will propel a more robust upgrade cycle for mobile phones and fuel increased demand for its products. 
Overall, the company sees accelerating AI-driven opportunities for memory and storage across multiple market segments. Further, the improving industry demand and supply fundamentals bode well for long-term growth. 
Bottom Line
Micron should benefit from a reacceleration in volumes and improvement in pricing. Further, AI-led opportunities in the data center, PC, smartphones, and industrial segments position the company well for future growth. In addition, demand from the auto and industrial end markets are expected to provide stable revenue and profitability for Micron.  
While the majority of Wall Street analysts are bullish about MU, a few still aren't willing to endorse the stock. Out of the 26 analysts covering Micron, 18 have a “Strong Buy” recommendation, two analysts recommend a “Moderate Buy,” five have a “Hold,” and one maintains a “Strong Sell” recommendation. 
While the Street-high price target for Micron stock is $100 - indicating 50% potential upside for the shares - the average price target stands at $79.94, which implies 20% growth potential from current levels.

2023-10-26 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) Q3 Earnings and Revenues Beat Estimates,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-q3-earnings-and-revenues-beat-estimates,"Intel (INTC) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.41 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.21 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.59 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 95.24%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this world's largest chipmaker would post a loss of $0.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.13, delivering a surprise of 425%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.
Intel, which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, posted revenues of $14.16 billion for the quarter ended September 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.91%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $15.34 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Intel shares have added about 24.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 9%.
What's Next for Intel?
While Intel has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Intel: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.33 on $14.47 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.62 on $52.62 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor - General is currently in the top 20% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
Another stock from the same industry, Nvidia (NVDA), has yet to report results for the quarter ended October 2023. The results are expected to be released on November 21.
This maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +475.9%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.
Nvidia's revenues are expected to be $16.12 billion, up 171.7% from the year-ago quarter.

  Infosys Limited price-consensus-chart | Infosys Limited Quote
Infosys will leverage its expertise in Machine Learning models, trusted processes, functional and technical expertise to streamline sales forecast, e-commerce processes and customer experience for smart Europe GmbH.
The newest deal with smart Europe GmbH follows other 2023 European deals, including partnerships with Stark Group, Danske Bank, Keytrade Bank, ABN AMRO and ng-voice GmbH. In the second quarter of 2024, Infosys signed eight large deals in Europe.
However, the company is facing a mixed bag of challenges. Its business is being affected by near-term uncertainties stemming from inflation and higher interest rates. Slow decision-making processes, along with softness in digital transformation programs and discretionary spending in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, are hurting INFY’s volumes.
Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider
Currently, Infosys carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Shares of the company have declined 9.4% year to date.
Some better-ranked stocks from the broader technology sector are NVIDIA NVDA, NetEase NTES and Dell Technologies DELL, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVDA’s third-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings has been revised by 2 cents northward to $3.34 per share in the past 30 days. For fiscal 2024, earnings estimates have increased by 7 cents to $10.74 in the past 30 days.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2023-10-30 00:00:00+00:00,7 Stocks You Better Be Buying on Every Single Dip,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-you-better-be-buying-on-every-single-dip,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
With rising interest rates, explosive geopolitical tensions, the potential for recession, soaring inflation, and many Americans struggling, pessimism rules the roost. However, don’t let it chase you from the markets. Instead, as Warren Buffett says, be “greedy when others are fearful,” and consider these top stocks to buy on the dip.
Or, as he explained at an annual shareholder meeting: “During such scary periods, you should never forget two things: First, widespread fear is your friend as an investor because it serves up bargain purchases. Second, personal fear is your enemy. It will also be unwarranted,” as quoted by MarketWatch.
In short, while others run scared, consider top stocks to buy on the dip.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Weakness has become an opportunity in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). After running from about $150 to $500 this year, Nvidia pulled back to about $405 thanks to the broad market pullback, but now it’s one of the premium stocks to buy on the dip.
Now oversold on relative strength, MACD and Williams’ %R I’d like to see the tech giant retest $500 again shortly. Longer-term, NVDA is a $600 stock.
Better, earnings went through the roof. Adjusted EPS of $2.70 a share came in above expectations for $2.08. Revenue jumped 101% year over year to $13.5 billion, which was also above expectations for $11.2 billion.
For the current quarter, the company expects to see revenue of about $16 billion, which is also ahead of expectations. NVDA also announced plans to buyback $25 billion in stock.
Occidental Petroleum (OXY)

Many times, when Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) dips, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway will buy so consider this one of the best Buffet stocks to buy on the dip.
In fact, the firm just bought another 3.9 million shares, increasing its stake to 228 million shares, which is worth about $14.5 billion. That now gives Buffett a 25.8% stake in Occidental Petroleum.
“Buffett probably isn’t done building his stake in the company, given that Berkshire Hathaway has received the green light from regulators to own up to 50% of the company,” as noted by Business Insider.
MicroStrategy (MSTR)

In hopes of a Bitcoin ETF, Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) is back up to $34,700. And as long as BTC can continue to rocket higher, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) will follow.
In fact, from a current price of $406.76, I’d like to see MSTR test $500 again near-term. It’s another of the top stocks to buy on the dip. That’s because MSTR now owns about $4.68 billion worth of Bitcoin. So, the higher the value of BTC, the higher the potential value of MSTR. 
According to CoinDesk.com, “MicroStrategy now holds approximately 158,245 BTC, which were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.68 billion at an average purchase price of roughly $29,582 per bitcoin.
Take-Two Interactive (TTWO)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) is another of the stocks to buy on the dip, especially as the company nears the release of its hotly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI.
Even before its release, analysts believe it could see at least $1 billion at launch, and sell around 25 million copies initially. 
“In fiscal 2025, we expect to enter this new era by launching several groundbreaking titles that we believe will set new standards in our industry and enable us to achieve over $8 billion in net bookings and over $1 billion in adjusted unrestricted operating cashflow,” said company CEO Strauss Zelnick.
Analysts like TTWO here, too. JP Morgan, for example, just raised its price target on the stock to $165 from $162, with an overweight rating. The firm noted, “The company’s fiscal 2025 guidance for $8B-plus in bookings implies a substantial ramp-up in content before March 2025.”
Amazon (AMZN)

Even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) should be bought on every dip – especially ahead of the 2023 holidays. According to Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), online holiday sales are expected to reach $228.1 billion this year, a 4.8% jump year over year. 
The report also estimates that about 51% of online spending will be done on mobile devices, as well. In addition, according to Deloitte, e-commerce sales will rise between 10.3% and 12.8% this year. All of which is solid news for companies like Amazon.
Analysts at DA Davidson just raised their price target on AMZN to $157 from $150. Truist also raised its target to $176. Evercore ISI also raised its target to $195 from $190. All after AMZN posted solid earnings. EPS came in at 94 cents, as compared to expectations for 58 cents. Revenue of $143.1 billion was also above expectations for $141.4 billion.
While Amazon Web Services slightly missed expectations for $23.2 billion, with a print of $23.1 billion, CEO Andy Jassy is optimistic, especially with generative artificial intelligence likely to drive billions of dollars of revenue to it. 
Agree Realty (ADC)

Agree Realty (NYSE:ADC) is a beaten-down real estate investment trust trading at a 52-week low. Not only does it currently yield 5.46%, but some of its top clients are its high-grade tenants, including AutoZone(NYSE:AZO), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Target (NYSE:TGT), and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), for example. 
As of June, the company’s portfolio consisted of 2,004 properties located in 49 states and contained approximately 41.7 million square feet of gross leasable area. Insiders are also buying.
Board member John Rakolta bought about 30,000 shares for just under $1.9 million, as I also noted on Oct. 1. CEO Joey Agree bought 10,000 shares. Executive chairman and founder Richard Agree bought about 11,751 shares for just under $740,000.
Plus, consider this. The REIT owns retail properties that secured by triple net leases, where the tenant pays the property expenses such as real estate taxes, building insurance, and maintenance. All in addition to rent and utilities.
In addition, with properties leased to grocery, home improvement, dollar stores, and drug stores, it’s less susceptible to recession.
Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)

Or, if you want to diversify at a low cost, consider a beaten-down exchange-traded fund like the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK), especially with the artificial intelligence and machine learning booms in their infancy.
With an expense ratio of 0.10%, the ETF tracks the price and yield performance of the Technology Select Sector Index.
After dropping from about $172.50 to $161.12, the XLK ETF appears to have caught strong support again. From here, I’d like to see it rally back to $177.50.
I should also note the XLK ETF is technically oversold on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. The last time it was this oversold, it bounced from about $160 to a high of $172.83.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2023-11-03 00:00:00+00:00,"Fortinet (FTNT) Q3 Earnings Beat Expectations, Sales Miss",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fortinet-ftnt-q3-earnings-beat-expectations-sales-miss,"Fortinet Inc. FTNT reported mixed third-quarter 2023 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but sales missed the same. However, both the top and bottom lines registered a steady year-over-year improvement.

Fortinet reported third-quarter 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of 41 cents, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents. The bottom line improved 41.4% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 24 cents per share.

Total revenues of $1.33 billion missed the consensus mark by 1% but improved 16.1% year over year, driven by strength in demand from small enterprise customers.
Fortinet, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
Fortinet, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Fortinet, Inc. Quote
Quarter in Detail
Segment-wise, Product revenues declined 0.6% year over year to $465.9 million due to a slowdown in Secure Networking growth, along with challenges in sales execution and marketing efficiency.

Services revenues climbed 27.6% to $868.7 million, primarily driven by 34% growth in higher margin security subscriptions, which represents 57% of total services revenues. Services revenues accounted for 65% of total revenues. Our model estimates for Product and Services revenues were pegged at $499.7 million and $843.3 million, respectively.

Billings were up 5.7% to $1.49 billion, primarily driven by strong demand from small enterprises and international markets. Per our model, billings were pegged at $1.59 billion for the reported quarter.

As of Sep 30, 2023, deferred revenues were $5.29 billion, up 26% year over year.

Geographically, the Americas region registered the highest top-line growth with a 16.7% increase, followed by the Asia Pacific (APAC) region’s 16.3% and the Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region’s 15.4%. Our model estimated 17.6%, 20.1% and 14.2% top-line growth from the Americas, APAC and EMEA regions, respectively.

During the September-end quarter, the company secured 145 total deals worth $1 million or more each. The company added more than 6,400 new logos, supported by small enterprise customers, which grew bookings by 19%
Margins
The non-GAAP gross margin expanded 70 basis points (bps) year over year to 76.9% in the third quarter of 2023, driven by the increase in Services gross margins and the six-point mix shift from product revenues to services revenues. This reflects a contraction of 310 bps in the Product gross margin, while the Services gross margin expanded 60 bps.

Non-GAAP operating income was $371.4 million for the third quarter of 2023, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 27.8%.
Balance Sheet & Cash Flow
Fortinet exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.14 billion, down from the $3.29 billion reported at the end of the second quarter of 2023.

During the three and nine months ended Sep 30, 2023, Fortinet repurchased 10.4 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $58.43 per share and for an aggregate purchase price of $605.2 million.
Guidance
For 2023, Fortinet predicts revenues in the range of $5.27-$5.33 billion. Services revenues are projected in the range of $3.355-$3.375 billion. Billings are expected in the range of $6.095-$6.235 billion.

The non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin are expected in the band of 76-77% and 26.5-27.5%, respectively. Non-GAAP EPS is anticipated between $1.54 and $1.56. It forecasts a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 17% and a diluted share count between 790 million and 800 million.

Fortinet issued impressive guidance for the fourth quarter. The company estimates revenues in the range of $1.38-$1.44 billion. Billings are estimated in the band of $1.56-$1.7 billion.

The non-GAAP gross margin is expected in the range of 75.5-76.5%, while the non-GAAP operating margin is anticipated between 27.5% and 28.5%. Non-GAAP EPS is projected in the band of 42-44 cents. The company assumes a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 17% for the fourth quarter and diluted shares outstanding between 780 million and 790 million.

From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2023-11-06 00:00:00+00:00,Invest in the Market’s Momentum – and NVIDIA’s – With SPMO,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/invest-in-the-markets-momentum-and-nvidias-with-spmo,"Markets kicked off the week gaining on the momentum of last week’s strong performance. One stock in particular saw some major gains. Last week marked the S&P 500’s and Nasdaq Composite’s best week thus far since November 2022. The recent monthly jobs report also helped boost stocks.
RBC Capital Markets’ head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina is quoted in CNBC as writing: “The stock market has had a strong start to November.” She added: “the move seems deserved in light of what we’re seeing in most, though admittedly not all, of our sentiment indicators.”
Per CNBC, NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) stock rose more than 1% Monday morning after Bank of America expressed bullishness over the company in advance of its earnings report. The chipmaker has also greatly benefited from the surge of interest in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. NVIDIA's share price has risen more than 222% over the past year.

Investing in Market Momentum
For investors looking to benefit from some of this market momentum, the Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF (SPMO) may be what they’re looking for. The fund generally will invest at least 90% of its total assets in the securities that comprise the S&P 500 Momentum Index. The Index tracks the performance of stocks in the S&P 500 with a high ""momentum score.""
SPMO’s underlying index includes the top 100 stocks in the S&P 500 based on 12-month prior risk-adjusted performance. The index weighting is inversely proportional to the trailing volatility of each component, subject to single stock and sector constraints, per S&P Dow Jones Indices.
The ETF and its index are reconstituted and rebalanced twice a year on the third Fridays of March and September. Constituents are weighted by their market capitalization and their momentum score.
NVDA is currently the top holding in SPMO, with a weighting of 8.46% as of November 3.
And SPMO is relatively inexpensive, as the ETF charges just 13 basis points.

2023-11-07 00:00:00+00:00,Palo Alto (PANW) to Buy Talon Cyber Security for Prisma SASE,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/palo-alto-panw-to-buy-talon-cyber-security-for-prisma-sase,"Palo Alto Networks PANW recently entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Talon Cyber Security in order to augment its Prisma SASE platform with the latter’s Enterprise Browser technology. This agreement will enable PANW to provide solutions that allow users to securely access business applications from unmanaged devices.
Amid the productivity-focused Bring Your Own Device work culture, security often takes a back seat, as unmanaged devices come with vulnerabilities that cybercriminals exploit. Unlike centrally managed devices, unmanaged ones may lack enterprise-grade security, making them vulnerable, which can be exploited to breach enterprise applications and access sensitive information.
Users of Prisma SASE will now be able to leverage Talon Enterprise Browser’s capabilities to access a wide range of software-as-a-service and web applications from their personal devices, including mobile and other non-corporate devices, without compromising their privacy.
Palo Alto Networks, Inc. Price and Consensus

Palo Alto’s Prisma SASE combines WAN and network security services, such as CASB, FWaaS and Zero Trust, into one cloud-delivered model. The solution has been named the sole Leader in Gartner's 2023 Magic Quadrant for Single-Vendor SASE due to its compliance with all the requirements of the category, such as centralized control, monitored network and user activity, traffic inspection, data access control and cloud asset security.
The recent acquisition will greatly boost Prisma SASE's capabilities, which is similar to how PANW improved its Prisma Cloud platform with the buyout of Cider Security last year. The acquisition of Cider Security for application security and its recent definitive agreement to acquire Dig Security for Data Security Posture Management will ensure the enhancement of Prisma Cloud capabilities.
Furthermore, the acquisition of Bridgecrew in 2021 and several other important acquisitions like the buyout of Crypsis Group, LightCyber, Morta Security and Cyvera have enabled the company to broaden its portfolio and global reach.

2023-11-09 00:00:00+00:00,This Under-the-Radar Tech Stock Could Be AI's Biggest Winner,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-under-the-radar-tech-stock-could-be-ais-biggest-winner,"It's no secret as to why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is soaring this year -- its GPUs are proving to be the secret sauce powering today's incredible artificial intelligence applications.
But there will be other companies that benefit from skyrocketing AI chip demand in the future. The following stock is involved in semiconductor inspection -- a market that should see accelerating growth in the years ahead, thanks to AI.
Onto Innovation will ride the AI wave
Onto Innovation (NYSE: ONTO) is smaller than other better-known semiconductor equipment giants, but its products and end markets straddle two sweet spots for AI.
Formed in 2019 by the merger of Nanometrics and Rudolph Technologies, Onto Innovation specializes in process control systems, which scan semiconductor processors and systems for defects. This is important technology, as process control enables higher chip yields, which helps customers increase their profits. And the more advanced a chip is, the more process control is needed.
Artificial intelligence is increasing complexity within chips and in the interconnections between chips, and that complexity is set to increase exponentially in the years ahead.
The gate-all-around leap
Within leading-edge chips needed for AI, semiconductor foundries are now transitioning to a new transistor structure called gate-all-around (GAA), which should be in production next year. This is the next leap over the current FinFET structure, in which a transistor is surrounded on three sides by the controlling gate.
In GAA, the transistor will now be surrounded on all four sides and stacked vertically. This is much more complicated, and Onto believes it will lead to a 50% increase in its market opportunity on leading-edge nodes.
Onto's Atlas systems have been winning orders for leading-edge applications in GAA, with some analysts even saying it's taking some share from metrology giant KLA Corporation.
If GAA is attractive, advanced packaging blows it out of the water
Even more than chipmaking, the advanced packaging market is set to soar by an even greater percentage for a number of reasons, thanks to AI applications.
First, to process vast amounts of data quickly, AI systems require high-powered GPUs to be assembled close to high-bandwidth memory stacks. In addition, these systems usually include CPUs and an interposer, forming a complete system-on-chip. These AI SoCs require new packaging innovations and much more complexity, which should drive up the intensity for Onto's packaging systems.
Beyond that, CPUs and GPUs will also require packaging within processors themselves going forward.
You may have heard that chipmakers, such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, are now producing processors consisting of ""chiplets,"" or optimized portions of a chip manufactured separately and stitched together. This technique allows for greater price performance, and keeps up with Moore's Law as single dies run up against the laws of physics and photomask constraints.
While Nvidia still produces GPUs on a single die, it seems likely that even Nvidia will eventually transition to chiplet packages at some point.
Chiplet structures could see massive growth in the future. Between 2022 and 2030, Onto projects total chiplet packages will increase 18-fold, leading to a fourfold expansion of Onto's advanced packaging market.
That growth potential is already showing up. Back in August, Onto issued a press release saying it had received over $100 million in orders of its Dragonfly System for advanced packaging, to be delivered over the course of the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2024, with orders increasing after that.
That's a big deal for a single product and market, as Onto's revenue is projected to be just $820 million in total in 2023.
Image source: Getty Images.
Onto is not as expensive as it looks
At first glance, Onto looks expensive, at 34 times earnings. However, that valuation is deceptive for two reasons.
First, outside of AI, the larger PC and smartphone markets are currently in bad cyclical downturns. In fact, even though Onto's AI offerings are seeing rapid adoption, its overall revenue was down in the June quarter by 25% from the prior year.
However, those mature markets are likely bottoming now and should improve next year, with growth likely supercharged by AI tailwinds.
Onto also has just over $609 million of cash on its balance sheet. That's more than 10% of its market cap, which means the stock is about 10% ""cheaper"" when factoring in that excess cash.
Suffice it to say that while Onto may not be a screaming bargain, investors may be surprised at how much the company will grow over the next several years. It's a name growth investors should either buy or put on the watchlist.

NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose sharply on Tuesday, led by a more than 2% gain in the Nasdaq, as softer-than-expected inflation data supported the view that the Federal Reserve may be done raising interest rates.
The rate-sensitive real estate sector .SPLRCR was up 5.1%, on track for its biggest daily percentage gain since November 2022, while utilities .SPLRCUrose 3.2% and the small-cap Russell 2000 index .RUTadvanced 4.7%.
The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX briefly crossed the 4,500 mark for the first time in two months.
Data showed U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in October as Americans paid less for gasoline, and the annual rise in underlying inflation was the smallest in two years. In the 12 months through October, the CPI climbed 3.2% - below economists' estimates - after rising 3.7% in September.
""Small caps have been extremely sensitive as the rates have climbed higher,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The day's market rally overall ""is in direct response to that CPI report suggesting that perhaps the Fed is finished (hiking rates), although there are questions as to whether or not the Fed can declare victory,"" she said.
Since March 2022, the Fed has hiked its policy rate 525 basis points to combat high inflation.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 481.07 points, or 1.4%, to 34,818.94, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 82.38 points, or 1.87%, at 4,493.93 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 302.47 points, or 2.2%, at 14,070.21.
Investors also focused on negotiations by U.S. lawmakers over a funding bill as they face an end-of-week deadline to fund the federal government.
Among individual stocks, Snap Inc shares SNAP.N jumped following news that Amazon.com AMZN.O will allow Snapchat users in the United States to buy some products listed on the ecommerce company directly from the social media app.
Home DepotHD.N gained after the U.S. home improvement chain beat quarterly profit estimates.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 9.78-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.56-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 45 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 102 new highs and 120 new lows.

2023-11-15 00:00:00+00:00,"Microsoft introduces its own chips for AI, with eye on cost",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsoft-introduces-its-own-chips-for-ai-with-eye-on-cost,"By Stephen Nellis
Nov 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft MSFT.O on Wednesday announced a duo of custom-designed computing chips, joining other big tech firms that - faced with the high cost of delivering artificial intelligence services - are bringing key technologies in-house.
Microsoft said it does not plan to sell the chips but instead will use them to power its own subscription software offerings and as part of its Azure cloud computing service.
At its Ignite developer conference in Seattle, Microsoft introduced a new chip, called Maia, to speed up AI computing tasks and provide a foundation for its $30-a-month ""Copilot"" service for business software users, as well as for developers who want to make custom AI services.
The Maia chip was designed to run large language models, a type of AI software that underpins Microsoft's Azure OpenAI service and is a product of Microsoft's collaboration with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.
Microsoft and other tech giants such as Alphabet are grappling with the high cost of delivering AI services, which can be 10 times greater than for traditional services such as search engines.
Microsoft executives have said they plan to tackle those costs by routing nearly all of the company's sprawling efforts to put AI in its products through a common set of foundational AI models. The Maia chip, they said, is optimized for that work.
""We think this gives us a way that we can provide better solutions to our customers that are faster and lower cost and higher quality,"" said Scott Guthrie, the executive vice president of Microsoft's cloud and AI group.
Microsoft also said that next year it will offer its Azure customers cloud services that run on the newest flagship chips from Nvidia NVDA.O and Advanced Micro Devices.
""This is not something that's displacing Nvidia,"" said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of analyst firm Creative Strategies.
He said the Maia chip would allow Microsoft to sell AI services in the cloud until personal computers and phones are powerful enough to handle them.
""Microsoft has a very different kind of core opportunity here because they're making a lot of money per user for the services,"" Bajarin said.
Microsoft's second chip announced Tuesday is designed to be both an internal cost saver and an answer to Microsoft's chief cloud rival, Amazon Web Services.
Named Cobalt, the new chip is a central processing unit (CPU) made with technology from Arm Holdings O9Ty.F. Microsoft disclosed on Wednesday that it has already been testing Cobalt to power Teams, its business messaging tool.
But Microsoft's Guthrie said his company also wants to sell direct access to Cobalt to compete with the ""Graviton"" series of in-house chips offered by Amazon AMZN.O.
""We are designing our Cobalt solution to ensure that we are very competitive both in terms of performance as well as price-to-performance (compared with Amazon's chips),"" Guthrie said.
Microsoft gave few technical details that would allow gauging the chips' competitiveness versus those of traditional chipmakers. Rani Borkar, corporate vice president for Azure hardware systems and infrastructure, said both are made with 5-nanometer manufacturing technology from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW.
He added that the Maia chip would be strung together with standard Ethernet network cabling, rather than a more expensive custom Nvidia networking technology that Microsoft used in the supercomputers it built for OpenAI.
""You will see us going a lot more the standardization route,"" Borkar told Reuters.

NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise

GenAI Boom to Drive the Top Line
Though AI has been around for years, the meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT has captivated the world’s attention on the power of generative AI to augment human capability, suggesting that the AI boom may just get started.
Generative AI is a type of AI technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. It is driven by a large language model, which means it uses a lot of data to understand and generate conversations.
The growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $667.96 billion by 2030, according to a new report by Fortune Business Insights. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 47.5% from 2023 to 2030.
The adoption of ChatGPT among enterprises has already proven generative AI technology’s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.
However, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.
NVIDIA’s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises. During the first-quarter fiscal 2024earnings conference call the company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, already stated that existing data centers are insufficiently equipped to handle growing AI workloads.
NVIDIA’s GPUs are already being applied in AI models, which is expanding its footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing. The generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. NVIDIA expects its third-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to reach $16 billion from $5.93 billion in the year-ago quarter, largely driven by surging AI investments across the data center end market.

Vuzix’s sustained focus on developing new products with advanced features is helping it attract new customers, thereby boosting revenues. In August 2022, the company launched Blade 2 smart glasses, an augmented reality workforce solution that has advanced features specifically designed to meet the needs of connected workers.
Additionally, the company benefits from growing demand for its devices, particularly AI-enabled smart glasses. Expanding global sales channels are expected to drive top-line growth in the long haul.
Nonetheless, VUZI is facing a mixed bag of challenges, including delayed orders from its largest direct and channel customers.

2023-11-21 00:00:00+00:00,Keysight (KEYS) Q4 Earnings Top Estimates Despite Lower Revenues,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/keysight-keys-q4-earnings-top-estimates-despite-lower-revenues,"Keysight Technologies, Inc. KEYS reported relatively decent fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the bottom and the top line beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company reported a top-line contraction year over year owing to declining trends and cautious spending in commercial communications and consumer electronics. However, positive momentum in defense and aerospace cushioned the top line. The buyout of the ESI group diversified Keysight’s product offerings and improved its prospects in various end markets.
Net Income
Net income on a GAAP basis was $226 million or $1.28 per share, down from $299 million or $1.66 per share in the year-ago quarter. The downside was caused by top-line contraction year over year.

Non-GAAP net income in the reported quarter was $352 million or $1.99 per share compared with $386 million or $2.14 per share in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12 cents.

For fiscal 2023, GAAP net income declined to $1.06 billion or $5.91 per share from $1.12 billion or $6.18 per share in 2022. Net income on a non-GAAP basis stood at $1.49 billion or $8.33 per share, up from $1.39 billion or $7.63 per share in fiscal 2022.
Keysight Technologies Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

 Revenues
Net sales stood at $1,311 million compared with $1,443 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. Total orders declined 16% year over year to $1,327 million. Soft demand trends in various end markets impacted the top line. Positive trends in aerospace, defense and automotive are tailwinds. However, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,298 million.

In 2023, Keysight registered a revenue of $5.46 billion, up from $5.42 billion in 2022.

Communication Solutions Group (CSG) contributed $891 million, down 10% year over year. Cautious spending behavior amid inventory normalization impeded revenues in this vertical. However, healthy traction for AI-ML powered network and data center applications, 5G and Open RAN supported the top line. Growing investments in electromagnetic spectrum operations, radar, satellite solutions and defense technology upgradation are strong suits. The top line beat our revenue estimate of $876.8 million.

The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group (EISG) segment revenues dropped to $420 million from $451 million in the prior-year quarter. Constrained spending behavior negatively impacted sales in consumer electronics and manufacturing. Declining capex for new wafer capacity also impeded the top line from this vertical. However, healthy demand for Keysight's proprietary interferometer systems, solutions for silicon photonics and power semiconductors partially reversed this trend. Strength in automotive is a positive. The top line marginally outmatched our revenue estimate of $419.4 million.

Region-wise, Asia-Pacific revenues aggregated $513 million compared with $618 million in the prior-year quarter. Declining trends in all verticals led to a 17% year over year drop. The company reported a 4% year-over-year decline in the Americas to $571 million. Revenues from Europe were $227 million, down 2% from the year-ago quarter's levels.
Other Details
During the quarter, the company’s non-GAAP gross profit totaled $858 million compared with $926 million in the year-ago quarter, with gross margins of 65.5% and 64.2%, respectively. The non-GAAP operating margin was 29.3%, marginally down from 29.9% in the prior-year quarter.

CSG reported a non-GAAP operating margin of 28.8%, down 30 basis points (bps) year over year. EISG reported a non-GAAP operating margin of 30.3%, down 130 bps year over year.
Cash Flow & Liquidity
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Keysight generated $378 million in cash from operating activities compared with $398 million a year ago, bringing the respective tallies for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 to $1.41 billion and $1.14 billion. As of Oct 31, 2023, the company had $2,472 million in cash and cash equivalents with $1,195 million of long-term debt.
Outlook
For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Keysight expects revenues in the range of $1.235-$1.255 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are estimated between $1.53 and $1.59 per share.

Management expects a mixed demand environment will likely persist throughout the first half of fiscal 2024. The acquisition of a majority stake in the ESI group will strengthen Keysight’s portfolio with simulation software and virtual prototyping capabilities. This is likely to boost commercial expansion in the upcoming quarters.

Keysight currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Hypergrowth stocks offer substantial gains with notable annual revenue growth. These companies are often categorized as companies with fast growth rates, though profitability metrics can differ depending on the stock and its sector.
Indeed, recent years have given rise to unprofitable tech companies that have seen their valuations explode. Following the pandemic and a return of the zero-interest rate environment, investors increasingly bet on riskier and riskier growth stocks. However, since then, we’ve seen the fallout from rising interest rates and an evolving investing environment.
From here, I think it makes sense to still focus on select hypergrowth stocks, but those with the best balance sheets and fundamentals. In that regard, I’ve hand-picked a list of three hypergrowth stocks I think are still worth investing in, particularly on any big dips in the future.
Celsius Holdings (CELH)
Source: The Image Party / Shutterstock
Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) emerged as a major success in the last five years, soaring by an absolutely incredible 4,400%. The stock’s year-to-date surge isn’t anything to sneeze at either, coming in at 71%. Recently, the company thrilled shareholders with a 3-for-1 stock split, which, while not altering market value, can enhance investor appeal through psychological impact.
In Q3, Celsius achieved $385 million in revenue, marking a 105% year-over-year increase, with net income doubling to $84 million and a net profit margin exceeding 20%. Despite a 3,800% stock gain in five years and 50% year-to-date gains, Celsius, with a $12 billion market cap, retains growth potential. With a strong balance sheet boasting $1.2 billion in current assets covering $336 million in current liabilities, Celsius, thriving on heightened consumer demand, sustains a trajectory of growth.
Microsoft (MSFT)

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) empowers transformation through technology, trading between $261.03 and $412.15 in the past year, averaging $369.39, exceeding expected earnings each quarter. The acquisition of Activision Blizzard, known for Call of Duty and generating $3 billion, boosts Microsoft’s gaming industry foothold. With a 172.16% earnings growth in the last five years, Microsoft’s trajectory indicates continued success.
Microsoft’s quantum computing strategy diverges from the mainstream, requiring substantial research and development investments. This unique approach complements its AI advancements, contributing to the company’s growth narrative. 
With a robust portfolio of profitable ventures, Microsoft has a safety net as it explores the high-potential quantum computing domain. The addition of OpenAI’s previous CEO, Sam Altman, reinforces Microsoft’s commitment to AI innovation. Financially, Microsoft boasts impressive figures, with Q3 revenue at $56.5 billion, a 13% year-over-year increase, and net income reaching $22.3 billion, up 27% year-over-year.
Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) emerged as a top-performing stock in 2023, soaring over 240% year-to-date. Fueled by high demand for its AI solutions, powering advanced applications like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Nvidia’s GPUs proved efficient for complex AI tasks. Despite past market concerns, Nvidia’s resilience and innovation position it for continued growth.
Nvidia made a major stride this year with the launch of its first graphics processing unit (GPU) for accelerated quantum computing. This breakthrough platform allows researchers to create applications seamlessly blending quantum and classical computing, expanding computing capabilities. Nvidia goes further, partnering with IQM to drive hybrid quantum applications, aiming to boost performance and explore new computing realms.
Additionally, the company advances in home automation and IoT with its AI technologies, exemplified by the Bengaluru Airport’s use of the NVIDIA Metropolis vision AI platform by Industry.AI. Anticipated applications in smart homes reinforce its IoT leadership.
NVDA recently hit an all-time high of more than $500 per share, but has since fallen back to the $475 level at the time of writing. Lately, this has been a stock that’s been hard to buy at a discount. Long-term investors looking to gain exposure certainly have an intriguing dip to consider right now.

2023-11-28 00:00:00+00:00,2 Attractive Value Stocks to Consider as Earnings Approach,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-attractive-value-stocks-to-consider-as-earnings-approach,"Several top-rated Zacks stocks are set to report their quarterly results on Thursday, November 30, with now looking like an ideal time to buy.
Among them, Dell Technologies (DELL) and Titan Machinery (TITN) are two value stocks that investors may want to consider ahead of their earnings reports.
Dell Technologies Q3 Preview: Dell Technologies has become a major player in the artificial intelligence landscape through its partnership with Nvidia NVDA which has enabled the company to implement AI into its information technology solutions.
With Nvidia’s AI chips enhancing Dell’s PowerEdge systems management, it's noteworthy that the Zacks ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) indicates Dell’s third quarter earnings may come in better than expected. To that point, the Most Accurate Estimate for Dell’s Q3 earnings is pegged at $1.49 per share and 1% above the Zacks Consensus of $1.47 a share.

This is despite Q3 earnings forecasted to be down -36% following a very tough-to-compete-against prior year quarter that saw EPS at $2.30 per share. However, like Nvidia, Dell’s earnings potential has been much stronger than expected as of late and most recently beat Q2 EPS estimates by 54% in August with earnings at $1.74 per share compared to expectations of $1.13 a share.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Furthermore, Dell has surpassed earnings expectations for six consecutive quarters with its stock soaring +94% this year but still trading at a very reasonable 11.7X forward earnings multiple. This is still an advantageous discount to the Zacks Computers-IT Services Industry average of  24.3X and the S&P 500’s 21.8X.

Titan Machinery Q3 Preview: Ahead of its Q3 report on Thursday, Titan Machinery’s stock looks vastly undervalued with a leading network of full-service agricultural and construction equipment stores in the upper Midwest.
Trading near its 52-week lows at around $25 a share, much of the risk to reward looks priced into Titan Machinery’s stock although the company is also facing a tougher to compete against quarter. Third quarter earnings are expected to be down -17% to $1.51 per share but Titan Machinery’s stock trades at just 5.1X forward earnings and is expected to reach its bottom line expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate also having Q3 EPS at $1.51 a share.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Trading at a slight discount to its industry P/E average of 6X and well below the benchmark, it’s also noteworthy that Titan Machinery has surpassed earnings expectations in its last two quarterly reports most recently beating the Zacks Consensus for Q2 EPS by 20% with earnings at $1.38 per share compared to estimates of $1.15 a share.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Notably, Q3 sales are expected to be up 8% to $723.27 million and double-digit percentage growth is still expected on Titan Machinery’s annual top and bottom lines for its current fiscal 2024 which further suggests TITN shares may have been oversold as the company adjusts to higher inflation.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Takeaway
Going into their third quarter reports, Dell Technologies and Titan Machinery’s stock both sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and have an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for Value. Both stocks look undervalued in terms of their P/E valuations and should have a nice amount of upside if they are able to reach or exceed earnings expectations.

2023-11-30 00:00:00+00:00,3 Must-Own Stocks as Demand for AI Chips Soars,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-must-own-stocks-as-demand-for-ai-chips-soars,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Demand for artificial intelligence microchips shows no signs of slowing down. According to market research firm Gartner, by 2027, global AI chips revenue is expected to be more than double the size of the market in 2023, growing to $119.4 billion. Demand for chips is so high that many companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have announced plans to begin manufacturing their own chips going forward.
This all bodes well for the companies that specialize in the design and manufacture of the microchips and semiconductors that power the most advanced artificial intelligence models and platforms. Here are three must-own stocks as demand for AI chips soars.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM)

Few if any companies are as important to AI microchips as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM). The company, which is based in Taiwan, makes nearly three-quarters (75%) of all the microchips and semiconductors in the world. It has a near-monopoly position when it comes to fabricating chips and semis. While there are some political risks involved in TSM stock with China’s sovereign claims over Taiwan, they don’t take away from this company’s huge growth potential.
There’s an opportunity to buy TSM stock right now as it has retreated 11% from its 52-week high since the summer of this year and is currently trading 30% below the all-time high its shares reached in January 2022. For a tech company with a nearly half trillion dollar market cap, Taiwan Semi’s valuation looks cheap right now with the stock trading at 17 times future earnings estimates. And TSM stock pays a decent dividend of 46 cents per share each quarter, for a yield of 1.85%.
The median price target on TSM stock is 16% higher than where the shares currently trade.
Intel (INTC)

Hoping to give Taiwan Semiconductor a run for its money in the microchip production business is Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The company is spending billions of dollars with the goal of becoming the second largest chip foundry by 2030, behind TSMC. While Intel is investing huge sums of money to achieve its ambitions, the company’s latest financial results seem to suggest that the gamble is starting to pay off. INTC stock rose 7% in one day following the company’s Q3 print.
For this year’s third quarter, Intel reported earnings of 41 cents per share versus 22 cents that had been expected. Revenue amounted to $14.16 billion versus $13.53 billion that was anticipated. Company executives reiterated plans to cut costs by $3 billion this year and stressed that operating expenses were 15% lower than a year ago. The company’s foundry unit remains a small part of Intel’s overall business. However, the foundry business’ sales grew nearly 300% from a year ago to reach $311 million in Q3.
During anearnings callwith analysts and media, Intel’s management team said that the company is on track to catch up with Taiwan Semiconductor’s chipmaking technology by 2025. INTC stock has gained 68% this year.
Arm Holdings (ARM)

Now for the new kid on the block. That would be Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM). Not only are the British company’s microchips found in nearly every smartphone on the planet, but it just recently unveiled a new new Cortex-M52 processor that’s capable of running AI applications on the smallest Internet of Things (IOT) devices. Arm Holdings has also established a partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the world’s leading AI chip designer to develop chips for personal computers.
Arm only went public in September of this year. And while its stock has pulled back since its heavily hyped initial public offering (IPO), there’s reason to be optimistic about the company and the future of its stock. Arm’s first earnings report as a publicly traded concern contained some encouraging numbers. If nothing else, Arm is already profitable, which is more than can be said for most companies that go public these days.
The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of 36 cents, which was in line with analyst forecasts. Revenue totaled $806 million versus $744.3 million that was expected. The company’s revenue was up 28% from a year earlier, and Arm boasted that it sold more than 7.1 billion microchips during Q3 of this year. Since its market debut, ARM stock has gained 2%.

2023-12-01 00:00:00+00:00,Motorola (MSI) to Boost Airport Communication in Germany,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/motorola-msi-to-boost-airport-communication-in-germany,"Motorola Solutions, Inc. MSI announced that Cologne Bonn Airport has opted to upgrade TETRA (terrestrial trunked radio) digital radio communication infrastructure, leveraging Motorola’s TETRA solution portfolio. TETRA is a vital component in airport communication for its reliability, coverage and efficiency in operations. It also boasts advanced security features owing to user authentication mechanisms.

To modernize the airport’s network infrastructure, Motorola is offering the DIMETRA X Core system, designed to provide mission-critical voice and data communications. Along with enhanced flexibility and security, this system also provides greater scalability, capable of supporting a single site to a network spanning 5000 sites or more. The solution also comes with multi-layered cyber defense features that incorporate regular security updates, operating system patching, anti-virus and more.

The technology also exhibits robust adaptability. With a software-based core, it allows users to augment capacity, launch new features and tailor communication system per the airport’s evolving requirements. The solution also centralized the communication network to bolster administrative efficiency. The capability to prevent single-point failures enhances the resilience of the TETRA network and makes it suitable for any unfavorable circumstances.

In 2022, Bonn Airport witnessed a staggering 8.8 million passengers and 971,000 tons of cargo shipping. Owing to its strategic position, the airport plays a crucial role as a hub for businesses, tourism and economic activities within the region. The smooth functioning of the airport operations is heavily dependent on frontline workers such as logistics partners, ramp agents and baggage handlers.

Ensuring perfect synchronization in this complex spread-out system is a challenging endeavor. The DIMETRA X Core system brings some enticing features like the Inter System Interface to facilitate effective collaboration. It also includes various service and support packages essential for maintaining the system at its peak performance level.  
The successful deployment of the technology will ensure full coverage both inside and outside the terminal building, streamlining logistics and cargo management and ensuring premium passenger service.  
Motorola is a leading provider of TETRA solutions, boasting 25 years of experience. It has installed approximately 1,000 systems worldwide across multiple industries. The company is leveraging this acquired expertise to augment the capability of its latest DIMETRA solution. Additionally, Motorola also secured a ten-year service contract from Bonn Airport to optimize network operation 24/7. This includes responsibilities for repair, maintenance services and the technological advancement of the network infrastructure.

As a leading provider of mission-critical communication products and services worldwide, Motorola has ensured a steady revenue stream from this niche market. The communications equipment maker intends to boost its position in the public safety domain by entering into strategic alliances with other players in the ecosystem.

The stock has gained 18.4% over the past year against the industry’s decline of 7.2%.

2023-12-04 00:00:00+00:00,The Next NVDA? 3 AI Stocks the Gurus Are Buying Hand Over Fist,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-next-nvda-3-ai-stocks-the-gurus-are-buying-hand-over-fist,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The release of OpenAI‘s generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, ChatGPT, set the world on fire with the technology’s nascent potential. Yet the practicality of Nvidia‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips, which allow AI to function to its full potential, arguably showed investors how they could profit from it.
Nvidia stock became a rocket. Just this year its shares more than tripled in value. It was deemed one of the so-called Magnificent 7 tech stocks that accounted for almost all of the S&P 500‘s gains in 2023. Because Nvidia’s $1.15 trillion valuation is equal to about 3% of the index’s total capitalization, it means the chipmaker was singlehandedly influencing the benchmark’s direction.
Yet its stock is priced for perfection today. Seeing where investing gurus are looking to find the next NVDA could help our own portfolios profit from the experience. Below are three AI stocks these billionaires are buying hand over fist. 
Microsoft (MSFT)

As a major investor in OpenAI, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) had the most to lose from the turmoil that erupted at the company when its directors ousted the company’s founder and CEO. Microsoft was instrumental in bringing him back and dismissing the board. The tech giant also got an observer’s seat on the board to watch over its investment.
It’s natural that Microsoft is working to protect the technology since it’s integrating ChatGPT into every facet of its business. The Bing search engine, cloud service platform Azure, Teams collaborative tools, and Microsoft 365 Copilot are all embedded with AI. By combining the power of large language models (LLMs) within the basic structure of Microsoft’s offerings, they become powerful productivity tools.
Both Ron Baron of Baron Capital and Joel Greenblatt of Gotham Asset Management were establishing new positions in MSFT stock. Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments, however, was adding to an already substantial stake in the business. Specifically, Fisher owns almost 25 million shares which make him a significant stockholder in the company.
The stock is expensive on traditional valuation measures, but because it continuously grows free cash flow while raising its dividend yearly, shareholders new and old are well rewarded. 
Duolingo (DUOL)
Source: dennizn / Shutterstock
As its name suggests Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) helps teach you a new language through its language learning app. It uses a freemium model to lure you in with free access to its courses. Once you’re hooked, it then prompts you to pay up to explore more advanced tools. Increasingly, those are enhanced with or driven by AI. Roleplay, for example, is an AI conversation partner employing OpenAI’s newest, most advanced chatbot, ChatGPT-4. 
While most users do just use the free portion of its software, Duolingo is becoming adept at converting a growing number of users to the paid side of the platform. Subscription bookings surged 54% last quarter to $121.3 million with paid subscribers numbering 5.8 million, a 60% year-over-year increase. Total monthly active users stood at 83.1 million, up 47%.
Duolingo is having almost as much success as Nvidia. Shares tripled in 2023 and spiked last month after a blowout quarter. The language app caught the attention of several astute investing gurus. Both Baron and Greenblatt were again actively staking out new positions in Duolingo too. With estimated average purchase prices of $147 a share, the billionaire investors have already gained 45% on their purchases.
The stock is obviously not cheap anymore but seems to have significant growth opportunities. Duolingo is developing math and music lessons to add to its core language programs. It says it won’t go beyond this right now because it wants each offering to be successful. That’s a smart management team that won’t throw AI at every problem even though it could.
Palantir Technologies (PLTR)
Source: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com
Data analytics are a perfect application for AI, and Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) thought so too, launching its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) a few months ago. Already it’s having an impact as the big data stock reported its fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP profits. It’s the first time in its history it’s been profitable on a trailing 12-month basis. It credited AIP with helping to drive that growth.
The platform is opening new possibilities for existing customers while bringing in new ones. Commercial customers grew 37% to 181, raising revenue by 23% year over year. Government revenue grew 12% from last year.
Palantir is deemed the best way to profit from AI’s potential. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives calls it “the best pure-play AI name” while global marketing intelligence firm IDC ranked Palantir as the No. 1 AI software platform. Mario Gabelli of Gabelli Asset Management certainly thinks so, as well. He was busy buying more shares of Palantir. He increased his stake by 26% to 95,000 shares.
Palantir Technologies stock also tripled in value this year yet appears to have plenty more room to expand. Joining in with the gurus buying this stock isn’t a bad strategy at all.

Dec 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended down on Wednesday, pulled lower by megacaps and energy shares as signs of a cooling jobs market reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates early next year.
The ADP National Employment report showed private payrolls increased by 103,000 jobs in November, below economists' expectation of 130,000. That provided fresh evidence of labor market weakness, a day after news of a drop in October job openings.
The latest employment data reinforced expectations the Fed's rate-hike campaign is cooling the economy.
""Right now, it's consistent with the overall trajectory of softening job growth, and so far that's not problematic because the economy is still humming along,"" said Bill Merz, head of capital markets research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.
""What would be concerning is if that trend persists for too long, and it turns into large job losses.""

On Friday, the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report for November will offer greater clarity on the state of the labor market.
Investors widely expect the Fed to hold rates steady at its meeting next week and potentially start cutting rates in March.
A slim majority of economists in a Reuters poll said they believe the Fed will leave rates unchanged at least until July, later than earlier thought.
Optimism about rate cuts helped push the S&P 500 .SPX up nearly 9% in November, and the benchmark is now down about 9% below its record high close in December 2021.

2023-12-08 00:00:00+00:00,"Stock-Split Watch: 2 Unstoppable ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks That Could Split Their Shares in 2024",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-split-watch%3A-2-unstoppable-magnificent-seven-stocks-that-could-split-their-shares-in,"One of the more striking trends in recent years has been the resurgence of stock splits. The introduction of no-cost and low-cost trading in recent years has eliminated the need to buy stocks in round lots of 100 shares.
Yet as thecurrent stock marketrally has illustrated, share prices can quickly rise to hundreds or thousands of dollars, discouraging smaller retail investors from buying the stock. As a result, stock splits have seen a resurgence in popularity.
While a great many stocks are still reeling from last year's bear market, many have come roaring back, with some sporting double- or even triple-digit gains so far this year. Among those have been the vaunted ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks (as of market close on Wednesday):
Alphabet: Up 47%
Amazon: Up 72%
Apple: Up 48%
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META): Up 164%
Microsoft: Up 54%
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): Up 211%
Tesla: Up 94%
So while a stock split doesn't impact the company's underlying value, it makes the stock more affordable for the average investor. Here are two Magnificent Seven stocks that have surged in price this year and could split their shares in 2024.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Meta Platforms' current price: $327
During periods of economic instability, businesses tend to slow spending to shore up their financial statements. Marketing budgets are among the easiest to cut on short notice, which cast a pall on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) last year, as the stock plunged 64%.
The company took swift action, embarking on a dramatic cost-cutting campaign and paring back its workforce. From its initial estimate in a range of $94 billion to $100 billion, Meta Platforms slashed its full-year 2023 expense estimates to a range of $88 billion and $89 billion. Add to that a return to revenue growth this year, and investors have responded accordingly, driving the stock up 164%, within striking distance of a new all-time high.
The company's recent results help illustrate its future potential. In the third quarter, Meta's revenue grew 23% year over year to $34.1 billion, while earnings per share (EPS) surged 168% to $4.39. Those results come despite the fact that digital ad spending grew by just 7.8% this year, its slowest rate in more than a decade, according to Insider Intelligence. When historic ad spending resumes, as it no doubt will, Meta Platforms is well positioned to reap the rewards.
Recent moves into artificial intelligence (AI) could well accelerate Meta's growth. The company has released AI-powered tools for advertisers on its platform, and Advantage+ is ""one of the fastest-growing ad products"" in Meta's history. A recent trial showed a 35% increase in return on ad spend, along with a 58% decrease in incremental cost per purchase. By automating many mundane marketing functions, Meta is simplifying the advertising process and making it less expensive, likely attracting more marketing dollars.
Meta's growth this year has been stellar, but is even more pronounced when viewed over the past decade. Revenue has grown 1,220%, while net income surged 2,110%. This has fueled Meta's robust stock price gains of 481%, with the stock price recently clocking in at roughly $317 as of Wednesday's market close. Given the company's history of growth and continuing prospects, there's a very real possibility that Meta Platforms could enact a stock split in 2024.
2. Nvidia's current price: $466
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that make video game images more realistic. From those humble beginnings, the company has become a technology powerhouse, underpinning everything from cloud computing to self-driving cars, and from data centers to AI.
By designing hardware and software packages that make its chips perform even better, Nvidia stays light-years ahead of the competition in terms of performance.
That's why Nvidia controls a dominant 80% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, according to data provided by Jon Peddie Research (via Tom's Hardware). But that's just the beginning.
Nvidia is also the leading provider of GPUs used in data centers, with a market share estimated at 95%, per CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. If that weren't enough, Nvidia controls as much as 95% of the machine learning market, according to analysts at New Street Research. Current demand for AI processors is off the charts, and Nvidia has established itself as the gold standard. Since we're still in the early innings of AI, there's likely more to come.
The company has been able to parlay that dominance into superb financial results. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), the company delivered record revenue that jumped 206% to $18.1 billion, while its diluted EPS surged 1,274% to $3.71. It's worth noting that the year-over-year percentage gains were skewed by weakness during last year's downturn, which in no way detracts from the enormity of Nvidia's accomplishment.
Nvidia has grown like a weed this year, but that's not unusual. Looking back over the past 10 years, the company has increased revenue by 1,480%, while net income soared 6,190%. This has fueled Nvidia's massive stock price gains of 11,950% over the same ten-year period, with the stock price recently clocking in at about $466 as of Thursday's market close.
Given the company's market-leading positions in numerous secular growth industries, history of continued innovation, and soaring stock price, it wouldn't be surprising if Nvidia conducted a stock split in 2024.
The elephant in the room
While both of these stocks have far outpaced the returns of the broader market indexes over the past 10 years, there's the matter of valuation to consider. Meta Platforms currently sells for 28 times earnings, a bit higher than the price-to-earnings ratio of 25 for the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite.
The difference is much greater with Nvidia, which is trading for 60 times earnings. That's enough to send some investors running for cover.
That said, given their history of market-beating returns and exceptional performances, I'd argue that both stocks are deserving of a premium -- and frankly worth every penny.

2023-12-11 00:00:00+00:00,NVIDIA (NVDA) Taps Southeast Asia Amid China Sales Restriction,NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-nvda-taps-southeast-asia-amid-china-sales-restriction,"NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is focusing on deepening its business relationship with Southeast Asian nations amid growing tensions between the United States and China, as evident from some recent events. Over the past week, the co-founder and CEO of the U.S.-based semiconductor company, Jensen Huang, has visited three Southeast Asian countries, namely Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam.
During his visit to these nations, Huang stated that Southeast Asia could be a very important technology location. Considering the region’s expertise in packaging, assembling and battery manufacturing, he believes that it can play a major role in the semiconductor supply chain.
NVIDIA signed an artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure deal with the Malaysian conglomerate YTL’s subsidiary, YTL Power International, during his trip to Malaysia. Per the agreement, the two companies will work together on building AI capabilities at YTL’s data center complex in Kulai, Johor. The first phase of the project is anticipated to be operational starting mid-2024. The deal is expected to be worth $4.3 billion.
In Vietnam, NVIDIA’s CEO has shown interest in deepening business ties with Vietnamese top tech firms and is also looking forward to setting a second base for the company in the country. Huang also intends to support Vietnam in training the workforce to develop AI and digital infrastructure.
The company has already invested $250 million in Vietnam through partnering with the country’s top tech companies. These collaborations focus on deploying AI across multiple industries, including cloud services, healthcare and automotive.

NVIDIA Looks Toward Diversifying Its Market Presence
The U.S. chipmaker has been caught in the crossfire of the U.S.-China tech war. Over the past year, the U.S. government has restricted NVIDIA from selling its several advanced AI chips to China in a bid to restrict the country from getting hands-on cutting-edge technologies that can strengthen its military.
NVIDIA had earlier stated that it may be forced to discontinue its business operations from countries on the U.S. government’s export restriction list. The rules are expected to impact NVDA’s ability to support its existing customers and complete the development of certain products in a timely manner. In third-quarter fiscal 2024, the company had generated 22% of its total revenues from China (including Hong Kong).
Considering the growing risk of doing business in China amid the tech war, the company is looking to expand its market presence. In this regard, the latest investments in Southeast Asian nations could be seen as its long-term strategic move to diversify its supply chain as well as market presence.
In third-quarter fiscal 2024, Singapore, a Southeast Asian nation, generated $2.7 billion in revenues, contributing approximately 15% to NVIDIA’s total sales in the quarter. This marked a robust five-fold year-over-year growth, mainly driven by surging AI investments across the data center end-market.
We believe that NVIDIA, with its latest investments, is seems to looking for such growth from other Southeast Asian countries.
Investment in GenAI to Drive Growth
NVIDIA dominates the market for AI chips. The meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and its adoption among enterprises have already proven generative AI technology’s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development. The growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications.
However, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.
NVIDIA’s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises. The company’s GPUs are already being applied in AI models. This is expanding NVDA’s footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.
The generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. Considering surging AI investments across the data center end-market, NVIDIA expects its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to reach $20 billion from $6.05 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Shares of NVDA have surged 219% year to date (YTD).

2023-12-12 00:00:00+00:00,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Crushed Wall Street in 2023, but This Stock Could Continue the Party in 2024",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-magnificent-seven-stocks-crushed-wall-street-in-2023-but-this-stock-could-continue-the,"The ""Magnificent Seven,"" a select group of the world's largest technology companies, has been the story of Wall Street this year. These stocks have seen gains of between 50% and 219% since in 2023.
Such gains aren't typical for stocks, especially those that are already among the largest market cap companies on the planet. It's fair to wonder whether the party will end in 2024.
Unfortunately, these types of gains probably won't go on forever. However, there could be one exception, one of the ""Magnificent Seven"" that's just getting started.
A year for the ages
If you're unfamiliar with the Magnificent Seven, they are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). They are not only leaders in their fields but have massive revenue and profits, are trusted brands, and have the attention of investors and consumers.
It's been a great year if you've been holding these stocks. The most popular stocks don't always perform well, but 2023 was an extraordinary year.
AAPL data by YCharts.
Investors must always put things in context, and this is no exception. While these stocks have gone to the metaphorical moon, their valuations have mostly followed. Their forward price-to-earnings ratios have risen by as much as 160%, except for one.
AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.
Chip company Nvidia's forward earnings valuation actually fell despite its massive share price growth this year. That's because Nvidia is at the front of a generational growth opportunity, similar to what the internet or cloud technology did for the modern economy.
A $2 trillion industry in the making
Nvidia emerged as a force in artificial intelligence (AI). AI models require a ton of computing power to process immense amounts of data quickly. The hardware that provides that power is what allows users to type complex questions into large language models like ChatGPT and get detailed answers in seconds. Nvidia specializes in chips designed for these high-compute workloads.
Analysts estimate that it has a market share of between 70% and 95% in that slice of the chip market, dominating an industry with billions of dollars of investment pouring in. That shows up in Nvidia's financials, too, where its revenue growth has taken off in 2023.
NVDA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts.
This could only be the beginning. Lisa Su, CEO of rival Advanced Micro Devices, has predicted the AI chip market will balloon to over $400 billion in the coming years. Researchers at Statista believe the global AI market opportunity will be worth as much as $2 trillion by 2030.
Even if AMD and other competitors chip away at Nvidia's market share, the growth of the pie could offset a lot of what they take from it. Remember, Nvidia's companywide revenue is at $45 billion today. A $400 billion chip market that Nvidia dominates should translate to years of revenue growth.
Somehow, Nvidia stock is still affordable
If these predictions are remotely accurate, you can make the case that Nvidia is still cheap today. Analysts believe Nvidia's earnings per share will come in at around $12.29 for the year. That gives it a price-to-earnings ratio of 38.
Growth expectations rocketed higher as Nvidia's growth accelerated and showed the impact AI could have on its business.
NVDA EPS LT Growth Estimates data by YCharts.
For a business growing earnings at 39%, a price-to-earnings ratio of 38 is a fine valuation. There are risks, in that Nvidia must live up to these high expectations. The stock has also risen by more than 200% since January, and any stock on that kind of a tear can cool off, so investors should expect some volatility.
But when all is said and done, AI would have to be a complete fluke for the long-term trend to point anywhere but up. Nvidia controls most of the market's AI chips, the building blocks of this new technology. That's a great driver's seat for the company and an opportunity for investors to ride Nvidia higher.

2023-12-14 00:00:00+00:00,"Up 230%, 3 Reasons Nvidia Stock Can Still Make You Richer",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/up-230-3-reasons-nvidia-stock-can-still-make-you-richer,"Perhaps no company epitomizes 2023's artificial intelligence (AI) boom more than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Shares of the tech giant soared a whopping 230% as investors piled in based on optimism that rising demand for its advanced chips would boost revenue and earnings. Let's discuss three reasons why the meteoric rise looks far from over.
1. Nvidia's operating results are incredible
Founded in 1993, Nvidia is known for pioneering the graphics processing unit (GPU), a computer chip originally designed to render complex visuals and animations mainly for the video game industry. GPUs work through parallel processing, which involves computing multiple tasks simultaneously. This turned out to have massive applications in non-graphics-related tasks like generative AI because it helps train large language models (LLMs) on vast amounts of data.
Nvidia's early focus on video game hardware gave it a massive head start in what is shaping up to be a much greater long-term opportunity. And the company's results demonstrate this epic transformation.
Nvidia's third-quarter revenue jumped 206% year over year to $18.12 billion based on sales of its new AI-capable GPUs for enterprise clients (data centers). The data center segment now represents 80% of company sales, eclipsing the previously core gaming segment, which is now under 16% of its top line. AI chips are expensive, with Nvidia's flagship H100 retailing for $30,000. And this can mean better margins and more profits -- especially since demand currently outstrips supply.
Nvidia's third-quarter net income soared by over 1,000% to $9.24 billion, and the company boasts a net income margin of 51%, which is pretty impressive for a company that manufactures and sells physical products.
2. The AI market is big enough for competition
Rapid growth and abnormal profits attract competition like moths to a flame, and Nvidia's GPU business is no exception. The biggest threat may come from its oldest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, which is currently scaling up production of its M1300x family of chips, designed to rival Nvidia's H100 in AI model training and inference, which involves running the applications in real time after they have been trained.

But while Nvidia will no longer be the only game in town, that doesn't mean it has lost its economic moat. While AMD's chips are said to match Nvidia's performance, they are far behind in hitting the market, with sales expected to scale up in 2024. By the time the M1300x becomes widely available, Nvidia has plenty of time to release even more advanced chips, maintaining the bleeding edge and the pricing power that comes with it.
With the AI chip market expected to reach $400 billion by 2027, there is plenty of room for both companies to share the massive opportunity.
3. Nvidia's valuation is still reasonable
After its meteoric rise in 2023, Nvidia's share price looks quite expensive on the surface. Its price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 26 is 10 times higher than the S&P 500 average of 2.6. But that metric doesn't account for Nvidia's rapid growth rate or spectacular margins.
With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 24, Nvidia's stock is still relatively cheap compared to projected future profits. And that means investors still aren't too late to bet on its long-term AI potential.

2023-12-15 00:00:00+00:00,"Can Nvidia Stock Hit $1,000 in 2024?",NVDA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-nvidia-stock-hit-%241000-in-2024,"Leading accelerated computing player Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has emerged as a Wall Street darling amid the artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy of 2023. The launch of OpenAI's famous chatbot ChatGPT also highlighted the role of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) in training and deploying large language models (LLMs), which drive generative AI applications like ChatGPT. Subsequently, many enterprises started increasingly adopting generative AI technologies, further spurring demand for the company's AI chips. This has been a catalyst for Nvidia in 2023.
Nvidia's share price is up by nearly 219% this year, thanks to its position as a leading GPU provider in the ongoing AI revolution. Can the company continue this pace of share price growth and reach $1,000 per share in 2024? Let's find out.
Impressive financial performance
Nvidia has posted stellar financial performance in its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ending Oct. 29, 2023), with revenues soaring by 206% year over year to $18.1 billion and net income surging by 1,259% year over year to $9.2 billion.
The data center segment (which accounted for almost 80% of Nvidia's total revenues) saw revenues jump year over year by 279% to $14.5 billion. Additionally, while the company's gaming segment was grappling with an excessive inventory buildup of GPUs in the past year, it is now showing signs of recovery in line with the overall PC market. In the third quarter, the company's gaming business reported revenues of $2.86 billion, up 81% year over year.
Multiple AI-driven opportunities
Unsurprisingly, the data center business is the biggest near-term opportunity for Nvidia. CEO Jensen Huang expects data centers to spend nearly $1 trillion in the next four years on upgrading general computing to accelerated computing infrastructure -- thereby equipping themselves to handle complex AI workloads. With Nvidia accounting for nearly 91.4% of the enterprise GPU market (in 2021), the company's cutting-edge AI chips (H100 and upcoming H200) are well positioned to leverage this opportunity.
Furthermore, the demand for Nvidia's proprietary InfiniBand networking technology has grown fivefold year over year in the third quarter, to enhance scale and performance while training LLMs. At the end of the third quarter, Nvidia has already crossed the $10 billion annualized run rate for its networking solutions.
Rather than focusing only on hardware, Nvidia has also made significant strides in its software strategy. The company expects its software, support, and services offerings to rake in around $1 billion in annual revenues in fiscal 2024. Nvidia expects its DGX Cloud service and AI enterprise software to be used extensively to train and deploy LLMs.
Nvidia's software-hardware ecosystem has helped it build a highly sticky customer base.
High valuation may be a deterrent
As of this writing, Nvidia is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 25.9, far more than the median semiconductor industry valuation of 2.9. A few analysts also think that the company deserves this premium valuation based on its prowess in accelerated computing, market-leading AI-focused data center offerings, and stellar financial numbers.
However, some risks should not be ignored. The recent U.S. restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips to China are a significant challenge for the company. With several small chip players chasing Nvidia's nearly 90% share in the $7 billion Chinese chip market, the company's top line may take a hit in the coming quarters.
Nvidia's P/S ratio has also increased in tandem with the share price in 2023. Therefore, with the current valuation assuming near-perfect execution for the company, chances of future multiple expansion amid the current difficult geopolitical environment appear slim.
So let's assume that the average P/S ratio reverts to Nvidia's five-year average multiple of 22.58 (which is still quite high) in 2024. Analysts expect Nvidia's revenues to be nearly $90 billion in fiscal 2025 (ending Jan. 31, 2025). Multiplying these numbers gives us an estimate of Nvidia's market capitalization of $2 trillion in 2024 -- less than double the company's current market capitalization of $1.15 trillion. Assuming that the share count remains constant, we can expect Nvidia's share price to reach around $820 in the best scenarios.
Hence, even with highly optimistic back-of-napkin calculations, Nvidia does not seem to reach $1,000 per share in 2024. But that doesn't mean that there is no growth potential in this stock. A bullish price target of over $800 is also impressive -- suggesting an upside of more than 71% in the next 12 months.
As such, it makes sense for retail investors to consider buying a small stake in the stock, even at elevated levels.
